If both children agree, I have no problem with it, after all, Chen Ping is a child I also watched growing up, and it’s not his fault that he’s in jail ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this time, Wang Changfeng came in with a large bowl, \nWang Changfeng\tfemale\tneutral\t“This is my own sauce, you guys try it ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Auntie Wang ……” Chen Ping saw Wang Changfeng walk in and hastily reached out to take the bowl!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping has been following Wang Changfeng’s family as neighbours since he came to Hongcheng in his teens, so the two families have a good relationship!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Auntie Wang, you are too kind. I grew up with that child Han Han, who is so understanding and beautiful, it would be great if our families could really be related ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tTang Hongying got up and pulled Wang Changfeng to sit down with her!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“I don’t want her to marry far away.
