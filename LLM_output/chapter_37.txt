I’m afraid I’m no match for him now!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu was embarra*sed when he heard this and said, \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping looked at Lin Tianhu, he could see that Lin Tianhu hadn’t had a particularly good time over the years, the scenery in the eyes of outsiders was only superficial, people like them could have their lives in danger at any time!\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“If anyone is looking for trouble with you, just look for me directly!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSince the Gathering of Righteousness Hall was a hall under himself, Chen Ping certainly couldn’t ignore it!\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tjoyful\t“With these words from the Hall Master, I am not afraid of anything, when the Hall Master steps in, even the ghosts and gods will give way, let alone a mere Feng Sihai!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen Lin Tianhu saw Chen Ping destroy those nine grievous dragons today, he was also inwardly shocked and admired him to the core!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping smiled, he didn’t expect this Lin Tianhu to be good at kissing a*s!"
