"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping lightly tapped his toes, his figure dodging the venom like a phantom, while his left hand formed a seal. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe Heart Condensing Technique surged within him, and a faint golden beam shot from his palm, striking the demonic flood dragon’s head with precision.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Roar!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe demonic flood dragon let out a piercing scream, its massive body thrashing wildly in the pool, splashing water that drenched the entire cave.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHu Mazi seized the moment, pushing the jade pendant’s glow to its limit. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe white light pierced the flood dragon’s eyes like a sharp sword.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIn agony, the flood dragon closed its eyes, its enormous body losing balance and crashing toward the shore.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Now’s the time!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tA glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe Immortal-Slaying Sword turned into a streak of light, piercing the flood dragon’s vital seven-inch spot in an instant.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBlack blood gushed like a fountain, and the flood dragon’s body twitched on the ground a few times before finally going still.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOnly then did the two relax, collapsing to the ground, panting heavily.\nHu Mazi\tmale\tconcerned\t“This demonic flood dragon’s strength was comparable to a third-grade Earth Immortal cultivator.”\nHu Mazi\tmale\tfearful\t“We’re only at the start of the Demon Burial Abyss, and already facing such a powerful guardian beast. It’s likely to get even more dangerous ahead.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping stood up, walked to the flood dragon’s body, and reached out to search its head, retrieving a black inner core.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe core radiated dense demonic energy, yet the power within it was exceptionally pure.\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“This inner core might be useful.”\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“Though the demonic energy is overbearing, if refined, it could boost our strength. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLet’s rest and recover before moving forward.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe glanced at the stone platform across the pool, where the light seemed brighter than the surroundings, likely hiding something valuable.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis flood dragon was probably the guardian of that platform.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter the flood dragon’s death, the pool in the cave gradually calmed. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe once-dark green water now shimmered with a faint black hue, emitting an even stronger stench.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping sat cross-legged by the pool, meditating and circulating the Heart Condensing Technique to absorb the surrounding demonic energy, restoring his depleted spiritual power. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tMeanwhile, Hu Mazi curiously approached the stone platform across the water.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe platform was covered in thick dust, with a bronze box placed on it. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe box’s surface bore intricate runes, identical to those on Hu Mazi’s jade pendant but far more complex.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tJust as he reached for it, Chen Ping shouted, \nChen Ping\tmale\turgent\t“Don’t touch it! \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe box has a restriction.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping approached, closely examining the runes on the bronze box, his brows furrowing, \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“This is a sealing rune array of the Hu Clan. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIt seems this box is indeed connected to your people.”\nHu Mazi\tmale\texcited\t“Left by my clan?” \nHu Mazi\tmale\tcurious\t“What could be inside?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“Hard to say.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping gathered a thread of spiritual energy at his fingertip, gently touching the box’s runes, \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“This array looks simple but hides profound intricacies. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tForcing it open might trigger a counterattack. \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\tHave you seen anything like this array before?”\nHu Mazi\tmale\tthoughtful\t“These runes… I’ve seen them in illustrations in my clan’s ancient texts. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThey seem to be a bloodline verification array, only unlockable by the Hu Clan’s blood.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tFollowing the method described in the ancient texts, he dripped blood from his fingertip onto the jade pendant. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe pendant instantly erupted in dazzling light, merging into the bronze box.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe runes on the box seemed to come alive, flowing along the light’s path. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWith a soft “click,” the box slowly opened.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tInside, there were no gold or jewels, only a yellowed beast hide and a black token.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe hide bore several lines of ancient text written in dark red ink, while the token was engraved with the character “Hu,” its edges studded with tiny crystals that emitted faint spiritual fluctuations."
