"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe dragon chair was a symbol of status, and sitting underneath it was quite imposing. Although Gu Mantian had collected many things, this dragon chair was his favourite thing, and he would sit on it almost every day to feel the majesty of the Son of Heaven back then!\nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\t“Ancient, I advise you to burn the dragon chair, perhaps you can still live longer!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping persuaded to Gu Mantian.\nGu Wentian\tmale\tangry\t“What do you mean?” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Wentian frowned, “At such a young age, are you cursing me to death?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Mantian was furious, if it wasn’t for the sake of Lin Tianhu, Chen Ping wouldn’t even be qualified to enter his compound, now that this Chen Ping had even spoken out of turn, how could Gu Mantian not be furious!\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tcalm\t“Ancient don’t be angry, Mr. Chen must have his reasons for saying so!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu hurriedly got up to dissuade Gu Wentian, then looked at Chen Ping and said, \nLin Tianhu\tmale\tneutral\t“Since Mr. Chen can see something, I hope he can tell the truth, Ancient is not an outsider!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOf course Lin Tianhu knew that Chen Ping was capable, otherwise he would not have become the head of the Heavenly Dragon Hall!\nGu Mantian\tmale\tangry\t“Kid, if you can’t tell us the reason today, no one will be able to save you!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Mantian snorted coldly and stood up from the dragon chair!\nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“It’s good that this dragon chair is a real relic of the Son of Heaven, and indeed of the Ming Dynasty, it’s just a pity that this dragon chair is filled with resentment, if I’m not wrong, the former Son of Heaven of a dynasty died on top of this dragon chair, otherwise there wouldn’t be such a great resentment.”\nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\t“The reason why Ancient sat on the dragon chair and did not feel anything is because this place is full of spiritual energy, it is a place of earthly excellence, which has temporarily suppressed the resentment on the dragon chair, but now the nine dragons on the dragon chair have all been charged with resentment, if you continue to stay, you are afraid that you will not live long, can’t you see that the nine heads on the dragon chair have all faintly blackened!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter Chen Ping’s words, Gu Wen Tian shivered consciously and hurriedly looked at his own dragon chair, and saw that the nine dragon heads were a little different in colour from the rest, becoming a little darker!\nGu Mantian\tmale\tskeptical\t“Kid, you don’t have to bluff me, this dragon’s head has turned black, it’s also caused by oxidation due to its age, what kind of grievance Qi rushes through the body, it’s just nonsense!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu asked the weather and slapped the table violently and said.\nChen Ping\tmale\tdisdainful\t“Forget it if you don’t believe me!” \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“I saved your life because you reminded me, but you didn’t appreciate it, this is probably your destiny, don’t look at your body now, but every night you will have nightmares about being entangled by a python, and finally you will wake up suffocated, you have been having such dreams for at least a month!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping finished, turned around and left!\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tembarrassed\t“Mr. Chen!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu looked embarrassed and hurriedly chased after him!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this moment, Gu Wentian was frozen on the spot, and was now in a state of shock, knowing that he had never mentioned anything about his dream to anyone, how could this Chen Ping know about it and know it so carefully?\nGu Wentian\tmale\turgent\t“Wait a minute!”\nGu Wentian quickly chased after him and shouted at Chen Ping.\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“What? Was I right?”\nGu Mantian\tmale\tembarrassed\t“Little …… Mr. Chen is right, I have been haunted by nightmares recently, and I have been having the same dream every day, it has been bothering me for a long time!”\nChen Ping\tmale\tindifferent\t“The python in that dream is the nine dragons on this dragon chair, now the nine dragons are rushing with resentment and have not yet turned completely black, if these nine dragons turn black all over, even if the Da Luo Golden Immortal comes down to earth, I’m afraid it won’t be able to save you!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Mantian was full of embarrassment and finally nodded, \nGu Wentian\tmale\ttrusting\t“Then, then what do I do now?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“Burn this dragon chair, not with ordinary fire, but use paper money to light it on fire, to burn it completely clean.”\nGu Wentian\tmale\tregretful\t“This …………” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Wentian looked at the dragon chair, his eyes were full of regret, he knew that this dragon chair was bought from abroad after a great deal of effort, this was suddenly burnt, Gu Wentian was a little \nGu Wentian\tmale\thopeful\tHe asked Chen Ping, “Mr. Chen, besides burning the dragon chair, is there any other way?”"
