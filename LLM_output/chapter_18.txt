"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu, Hall Master of the Gathering Hall, pays respects to the Hall Master!\nLin Tianhu\tmale\trespectful\t“My subordinate, Lin Tianhu, Hall Master of the Gathering Hall, pays respects to the Hall Master!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHundreds of people from the Gathering of Righteousness Hall shouted in unison!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis took Chen Ping by surprise, he himself didn’t even know what Hall Master he was!\nChen Ping\tmale\tsurprised\t“You …… have the wrong person, haven’t you? I am not some hall master!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping shook his head in a hurry.\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tserious\t“The one who wears the Heavenly Dragon Order is the Heavenly Dragon Hall Master, there is no mistake!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu’s words caused Chen Ping to instantly remember!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen he was in prison, that old dragon leader had always said that he was the Heavenly Dragon Hall Master, and later had given himself this ring, it looked like it was because of this ring that made this Lin Tianhu identify himself as the Heavenly Dragon Hall Master.\nChen Ping\tmale\tcurious\t“What do you mean, is it because I’m wearing this ring?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping took the ring off and asked Lin Tianhu.\nLin Tianhu\tmale\trespectful\t“Yes, this is none other than the Heavenly Dragon Hall’s Heavenly Dragon Order, the ancestral motto of the Heavenly Dragon Hall, and the wearer is the Heavenly Dragon Hall’s Hall Master!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu tilted his head and looked at the ring in Chen Ping’s hand and said.\nChen Ping\tmale\tcommanding\t“You guys get up first!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing Lin Tianhu and the others all kneeling, Chen Ping was a little uncomfortable, so he waved his hand!\nLin Tianhu\tmale\trespectful\t“Thank you, Hall Master!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu and a group of people from the Gathering Hall of Justice all stood up.\nChen Ping\tmale\tfrustrated\t“I’m telling you, I’m not any Hall Master, this ring was given to me by someone else, you’ve mistaken me for someone else!”\nLin Tianhu\tmale\trespectful\t“We only recognise the Heavenly Dragon Order, not people, since the Heavenly Dragon Order is on you, then you are our Hall Master!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping was speechless, it seemed that the old dragon leader had deliberately passed this temple lord position to him.\nChen Ping\tmale\tcurious\t“Are you also from the Heavenly Dragon Hall?”\nLin Tianhu\tmale\trespectful\t“Yes, there are thirteen halls in the Heavenly Dragon Hall, and our Gathering Hall is only one of them, but I am not familiar with the brothers from the other halls and rarely interact with them, so unless we receive a summons from the Hall Master, we are not to be exposed easily!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter hearing this, Chen Ping was staggered, one Gathering Hall could stomp around Hong City and make it tremble three times, if there were thirteen such halls, then the strength of this Heavenly Dragon Hall would be truly terrifying!\nLin Tianhu\tmale\trespectful\t“Hall Master, in addition to the thirteen halls in Grand Xia, we have branch offices all over the world, as for the specific information, I can’t understand it because my position is too low!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs Lin Tianhu’s words fell, Chen Ping was even more shocked, to have branch rudders all over the world, this was too awesome!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe really couldn’t understand that Old Leader, such a scruffy guy, was such an awesome character!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNow Chen Ping was looking forward to the 15th day of the 7th month, maybe he would be able to understand more about the Heavenly Dragon Temple by then!\nChen Ping\tmale\tcommanding\t“You all go back, if there’s anything, I’ll look for you!”\nLin Tianhu\tmale\trespectful\t“As you command!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu led his men away, but Chen Ping did not move, his heart still could not calm down for a long time, this sudden extra identity was too much for him to accept for a while!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this moment, at the Regal Hotel’s top floor office, Su Wenzong and Su Yuqi didn’t leave, instead they went to the top floor manager’s office, this was his Su family’s property, so they could go wherever they wanted!\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tcurious\t“Yuqi, what you said to Mr. Chen just now, were you serious?”\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tnervous\t“What words?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Yuqi played dumb and pretended not to know!\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tteasing\t“Less pretending, knowing your daughter is like a father, what’s in your heart, think I don’t know?”\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tdefensive\t“Dad, I was just trying to help Mr. Chen out, I’ve only just met him, how could I possibly like him!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Yuqi gave Su Wenzong a blank look, but her cheeks were blushing.\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tthoughtful\t“Mr. Chen is a nice person, he is also quite good looking, and he is highly skilled in medicine, but I just don’t know how he is in other aspects……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Wenzong had a good feeling about Chen Ping, but to become the son-in-law of their Su family, it was not enough for him to know medical skills alone, after all, Su Wenzong only had one daughter, and the huge family business of the Su family was to be handed over to Su Yuqi, so when the time came, he had to find someone who could help Su Yuqi take care of the company."
