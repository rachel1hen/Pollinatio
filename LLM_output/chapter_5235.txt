"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut at that moment, the real Chen Ping appeared behind him, the Demon-Whipping Lash coiling around You Wuji’s neck!\nChen Ping\tmale\tangry\t“Get down!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tCaught off guard, You Wuji stumbled, a sharp pain and numbness shooting through his neck.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe hurriedly channeled his energy to shake off the Demon-Whipping Lash, only to find the righteous energy on the whip clinging like a parasite, eroding his meridians.\nChen Ping\tmale\tconfident\t“Now’s the time!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tA glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes. He clenched his left fist, gathering all his strength into it, and smashed it fiercely into You Wuji’s back!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Bang!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe punch landed squarely, and You Wuji let out a muffled groan, his body trembling violently as he spat out a mouthful of black blood.\nNan Batian\tmale\tjoyful\t“Not bad, kid, that’s something!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNan Batian, watching from the side, nodded repeatedly, a smile of approval on his face.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe could tell that Chen Ping’s combat skills and control of power far surpassed monks of the same rank, even outshining some early-stage Earth Immortal cultivators.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHit repeatedly, You Wuji was consumed by rage.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAbandoning defense, his black fiend demonic energy surged wildly, his entire body shrouded in thick black mist, with only a pair of blood-red eyes visible.\nYou Wuji\tmale\tangry\t“You little bastard, I’ll make your soul vanish!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tFrom the black mist, countless black ghost claws extended, rushing towards Chen Ping like a tide.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis was You Wuji’s ultimate technique—Ten Thousand Ghosts Devouring Soul. Once caught by these claws, not only would the body be torn apart, but the soul would also be devoured.\nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\t“Move!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tDeciding instantly, Chen Ping disengaged, retreating swiftly while shouting.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe knew he was just sparring, and getting injured by You Wuji would outweigh the gains!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWith Nan Batian present, Chen Ping only needed to warm up!\nNan Batian\tmale\tmocking\t“Been waiting for you to say that!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNan Batian laughed heartily, his figure appearing in front of Chen Ping like a phantom.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWithout using any treasures, he casually raised his right hand and slapped towards the black mist.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe seemingly ordinary palm carried an irresistible pressure.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs the palm wind passed, the black ghost claws melted like snow in sunlight, and the thick black mist dissipated into nothing.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Pfft!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tYou Wuji’s figure was exposed. Looking at Nan Batian’s incoming palm, his eyes filled with fear and despair. He tried to dodge but found himself locked by an invisible force, unable to move.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Thud!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNan Batian’s palm struck You Wuji’s chest squarely.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNo earth-shattering roar, just a dull thud.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tYou Wuji’s body flew back like a broken kite, crashing heavily into a pillar in the hall and sliding to the ground.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tA clear palm print marked his chest, the bones beneath his black robe shattered inch by inch, black blood pouring from his mouth, his eyes rapidly losing focus.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tYou Wuji, a fifth-rank Earth Immortal, couldn’t withstand even a single move from Nan Batian!\nNan Batian\tmale\tcommanding\t“Fifth-rank Earth Immortal? Daring to act arrogant in front of me? Truly courting death.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tDespair flickered in You Wuji’s eyes; he knew he was defeated.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHis opponent’s strength was far beyond his, leaving him no chance of victory!\nChen Ping\tmale\tcold\t“Now, it’s time to settle the score.”\nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\t“You Wuji, I ask you: was the extermination of the Hu Clan back then the work of your Black Fiend Demon Palace?”\nYou Wuji\tmale\tsad\t“At this point, there’s no need to hide it. Yes, our Black Fiend Demon Palace was indeed involved in the Hu Clan’s destruction.”\nHu Mazi\tunknown\tangry\t“Why? Our Hu Clan had no grudge with you; why did you do this?”"
