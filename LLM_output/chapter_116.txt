You’re in a hurry to go to your next life…………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen Cui Zhiyuan finished cursing and saw that it was a Bentley, he was so scared that he hastily shut his mouth, those who could drive a Bentley in Hongcheng would definitely not be ordinary people, if he provoked this, he would be out of luck!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tJust as Chen Ping was on his way to Xian He Zhuang, a middle-aged man with a beard was sitting on an office chair in a luxurious office in Xian He Zhuang!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThere was a scar at the corner of his eye and he was trimming a cigar in his hand.
