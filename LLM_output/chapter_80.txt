I don’t know him!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping shook his head!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping did not know this youth, nor had he seen him, but this youth had seen Chen Ping, and had seen Chen Ping with his own eyes following Su Yuqi’s affair!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe youth was called Xing Jun, a foreign student who graduated from Stanford University abroad and was rehired after he took up a position in Su’s group, and this Xing Jun also had his eyes on Su Yuqi and had been pursuing her, only that Su Yuqi had not said yes!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter Su Wenzong gave Su Yuqi the company, because Su Yuqi did not manage it, so he transferred Xing Jun to be the general manager of Xin Yu Daily Chemical Co.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis Xing Jun did have some strength, and in a short time he managed the company in an orderly manner, and also became the most profitable subsidiary of the Su Group!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe reason why Xing Jun worked so hard was to get Su Yuqi to look at him, but when he found out that Su Yuqi was actually following a kid like Chen Ping who had been in jail, he had a huge inner transformation and he wanted to take Su Yuqi away from Chen Ping!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNow that Chen Ping had come to the company for an interview, of course he had to seize this opportunity, as long as Chen Ping stayed inside the company, he would have tens of thousands of ways to make Chen Ping know what to do, and he could also provoke Chen Ping to follow Su Yuqi’s relationship!\nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tpuzzled\t“It’s really strange ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tCui Zhiyuan frowned, but the general manager gave the word, he a department manager can not dare to disobey, can only say to Chen Ping: \nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tresigned\t“You go to the induction procedures, then I will send someone to take you familiar with the company ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNow Cui Zhiyuan did not dare to trouble Chen Ping for the time being, he did not know what kind of relationship this Chen Ping had with Xing Jun!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping was also a bit strange, he didn’t understand why this what’s-his-name Xing Jun, why did he leave himself behind, it looked like he knew him!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tCould it be that Su Yuqi knew that he had come to her company for an interview and had specially instructed this general manager?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping pondered with a slight frown as he followed that girl from the office out and was led through the induction procedure!\nnarrator\tunknown\tangry\t“D*mn, you kid turned out to be a reformer, I’m really unlucky to have talked to you for half a day, it’s too bad luck, just like you, you’ll never be able to apply for a job!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs soon as Chen Ping went out, he was counted by the young man who just wore gla*ses.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping looked at the young man, he originally felt that this young man was nice, but he didn’t expect him to be such a dog-eyed guy!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Mr. Chen, please come with me here, you need an ID card for the induction procedure, do you have it with you?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe girl who followed Chen Ping out asked to Chen Ping.\nChen Ping\tmale\tgrateful\t“Oh, I brought it!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping handed his ID card to that sister, and then smiled gratefully!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe knew that the girl had asked this on purpose, in order to say it to the young man!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSure enough, when the young man saw that Chen Ping had succeeded in his interview, his eyes were suddenly rounded and his face was full of incredulity!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut Chen Ping ignored him, and after a sneer, he followed the girl and left!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhile Chen Ping was applying for the job, in the sales department manager’s office, Sun Xiaomeng said to Cui Zhiyuan with an angry face: \nSun Xiaomeng\tfemale\tangry\t“What the hell is wrong with you? Didn’t you say not to hire him? Now that he’s been hired, he’s going to annoy me to death, and my dad will make me take him to work every day!”\nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tdefensive\t“Can you blame me for that?
