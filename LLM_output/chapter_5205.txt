"narrator\tunknown\tneutral_At that moment, the altar suddenly began to shake violently, the black demonic core erupting with a dazzling light, and the runes around the altar melted away rapidly like ice and snow.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_A tremendous pressure surged from beneath the altar, causing the entire underground palace to tremble, as if something were about to break through the earth.\nnarrator\tunknown\tangry\t“Damn it! The seal is breaking!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_Chen Ping’s face changed drastically, \nChen Ping\tmale\tangry\t“Youyue probably knew this would happen, she sent us to retrieve the demonic core just to make us break the seal!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_A deafening roar came from below the altar, the ground splitting into massive fissures, black demonic energy gushing out from the cracks, coalescing into a demonic figure dozens of metres tall.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_The demonic figure wielded a giant axe, its face ferocious, none other than the ancient demon general that had been sealed!\ndemon general\tmale\texcited\t“Hahaha… I am finally free!”\ndemon general\tmale\tangry\t“Two thousand eight hundred years, and someone still dares to break my seal!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_Hu Mazi’s face turned pale, his hand gripping the clan leader’s token trembling slightly, \nHu Mazi\tmale\tfearful\t“This is… the ancient demon general? Its aura is terrifying!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_Chen Ping shielded Hu Mazi behind him, his spiritual energy bursting forth unrestrained, the Dragon-Slaying Sword humming and emitting sharp sword energy, \nChen Ping\tmale\tdetermined\t“It just broke free, its strength hasn’t fully recovered, we still have a chance!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_The demon general’s gaze fell on Chen Ping, a hint of disdain flashing in its eyes, \ndemon general\tmale\tdisdainful\t“A mere human cultivator dares to act arrogantly before me? Die!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_It swung its giant axe towards them, the black axe energy carrying a world-destroying momentum, tearing the air of the underground palace apart.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_Chen Ping didn’t dare to be careless, pulling Hu Mazi and leaping aside to dodge the axe energy.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_The axe energy struck the ground with a loud boom, splitting the earth into a bottomless chasm, debris flying everywhere.\nChen Ping\tmale\turgent\t“Senior, this guy’s out, possess me and take him down, he’s no match for you!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_But no matter how much he shouted, the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord acted as if he hadn’t heard!\nChen Ping\tmale\tangry\t“Damn it, playing dead…”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_Chen Ping had no choice but to instruct Hu Mazi to reinforce it while he charged at the demon general with the Dragon-Slaying Sword, \nChen Ping\tmale\tdetermined\t“Master Hu, find a way to reinforce the seal!”\nChen Ping\tmale\tdetermined\t“I’ll hold it off!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_He knew that with just the two of them, defeating the ancient demon general was impossible, their only hope was to reseal it.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_Hu Mazi snapped to his senses, immediately taking out talisman paper and, following the methods passed down by his ancestors, began drawing runes to reinforce the seal.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_Seeing Chen Ping dare to attack, the demon general’s eyes flashed with anger, its giant axe sweeping towards Chen Ping’s waist.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_Chen Ping dodged like a phantom, simultaneously unleashing the Dragon-Slaying Sword, golden sword energy raining down on the demon general.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_However, the demon general’s defence was formidable, the sword energy leaving only faint white marks on its body, unable to cause any real damage.\ndemon general\tmale\tlaughing\t“Useless! My demonic body is impervious to blades and spears, you think your pathetic skills can harm me?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_The demon general laughed arrogantly, swinging its axe again, forcing Chen Ping to retreat repeatedly.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_Chen Ping grew anxious, he could feel the demon general’s strength recovering rapidly, if this continued, forget reinforcing the seal, both of them would die here.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_At that moment, he suddenly remembered the demonic dragon’s inner core and quickly took it out from his chest.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_The inner core radiated dense demonic energy, perhaps capable of temporarily suppressing the demon general.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_He infused spiritual energy into the core, which instantly burst with dazzling black light, shooting towards the demon general.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_Seeing the core, a trace of greed flashed in the demon general’s eyes, and it reached out to grab it.\nChen Ping\tmale\texcited\t“Now’s the chance!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral_Chen Ping seized the opportunity, the Dragon-Slaying Sword turning into a streak of light, slashing towards the demon general’s arm."
