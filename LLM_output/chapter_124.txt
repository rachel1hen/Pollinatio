"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tMr. Chen, I really didn’t know it was you. If I did, I wouldn’t dare to give me a hundred guts!\nLiao Fei Xiong\tmale\tnervous\t“Mr. Chen, I really didn’t know it was you. If I did, I wouldn’t dare to give me a hundred guts!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen Liao Fei Xiong saw this time, he could only follow Chen Ping and apologize. This was also considered that one had to bow down under the eaves of the house!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“You know me?” \nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\t“You know me?” \nLiao Fei Xiong\tmale\tnervous\t“I met Mr. Chen once at the ancient banquet. Our gang leader was injured by Mr. Chen……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Since you know that I injured Feng Sihai, why didn’t you seek revenge on me? And still treat me so politely?” \nChen Ping\tmale\tpuzzled\t“Since you know that I injured Feng Sihai, why didn’t you seek revenge on me? And still treat me so politely?” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe Gathering Hall and the Red Dragon Gang had always been at odds, and now that Chen Ping had injured Feng Sihai, it was only logical that the people of the Red Dragon Gang would be enemies when they saw him!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut this Liao Fei Xiong was polite to him, and he spoke very respectfully!\nLiao Fei Xiong\tmale\trespectful\t“Mr. Chen is joking. With Mr. Chen’s ability, unless I don’t want to live anymore myself, how dare I seek revenge from Mr. Chen……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping smiled. He didn’t expect this Liao Fei Xiong to be quite honest. A great man can bend and stretch; he can be considered a lord!\nChen Ping\tmale\tjoyful\tHe smiled.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Now you can tell me, who wants to buy my life?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\t“Now you can tell me, who wants to buy my life?”\nLiao Fei Xiong\tmale\tnervous\t“Xing Jun, he was the one who gave me a million to do so……” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhere would Liao Fei Xiong dare to hide? He would not lose his life for the sake of some rule!\nChen Ping\tmale\tcold\tChen Ping smiled coldly. He had already guessed that it was this Xing Jun who did it!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tTurning around and walking out of the office, Liao Fei Xiong then realized that he was already soaked through!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Brother Xiong, was the gang master really injured by this guy? It looks too young……”\nunknown\tmale\tsurprised\t“Brother Xiong, was the gang master really injured by this guy? It looks too young……”\nLiao Fei Xiong\tmale\tserious\t“Inform this down, no one is allowed to mess with this fierce star for me until the gang master returns……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Understood!” \nunknown\tmale\trespectful\t“Understood!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNodding their heads, the four big men immediately went down to inform!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAnd at this time in the private room, Xing Jun with his men had already had their fill of drinks. Seeing Chen Ping being taken away, Xing Jun was happy, so was Cui Zhiyuan!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tA general manager and a department manager, when two people are happy, how can others not be happy!\nXing Jun\tmale\tjoyful\tHaving had enough wine and food, Xing Jun got up and waved his hand, “That’s it for today. We have work to do tomorrow. I hope your sales department will keep up the good work……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe fact that Xing Jun was happy, he also drank a lot and his face was red!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSince Xing Jun announced that the banquet was over, no one dared to stay, so they all got up and prepared to leave!\nWang Han Han\tfemale\tnervous\t“Brother Chen Ping hasn’t come back yet, aren’t we going to wait for him?”\nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tangry\t“Wang Han Han, didn’t you hear what Chief Xing said? Let’s go back and rest so that we can work tomorrow. Are you trying to disobey General Manager Xing’s words?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWang Han Han had a nervous look on her face. She didn’t dare to obey Xing Jun, but she was worried about Chen Ping’s safety!\nSun Xiaomeng\tfemale\tcalm\t“Han Han, leave that Chen Ping alone. Maybe this guy has long since sneaked back in. Let’s go back first……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWang Han Han saw this, and could only go back first to see what happened!\nXing Jun\tmale\tmocking\tOn the other hand, Xing Jun on the side had the corners of his mouth slightly raised and sneered inwardly, “Chen Ping will never be going back.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut just as the crowd was about to leave, the door to the private room was pushed open and Chen Ping walked in!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Chen Ping?”\nunknown\tunknown\tsurprised\t“Chen Ping?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tEveryone was stunned to see Chen Ping come in. They thought Chen Ping had gone out and had long since been beaten and unable to move!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAnd the one who was even more surprised was Xing Jun. He had clearly said that he would help him get rid of Chen Ping, so how could Chen Ping suddenly appear again?\nWang Han Han\tfemale\tjoyful\t“Brother Chen Ping……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWang Han Han saw that Chen Ping had come back and hurriedly pounced on him with joy!\nXing Jun\tmale\tsurprised\t“How did you… you come back?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tcold\t“Of course I came back after things were resolved. Doesn’t GM Xing want me to come back?”"
