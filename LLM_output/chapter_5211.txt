"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping’s heart stirred. Green Snake Valley was also a power on the outskirts of Nine Coils Mountain, its leader a snake demon at the third rank of Earth Immortal.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe Black Wind Old Demon’s order to kill the Green Snake Valley leader was clearly a scheme to use them as pawns.\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“No problem,” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Wait,” \nBlack Wind Old Demon\tmale\tneutral\t“I’m sending two of my men with you, to see what you’re capable of.” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe pointed at two wolf demons nearby. \nBlack Wind Old Demon\tmale\tneutral\t“You two, go with them. If they try anything sneaky, kill them!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe two wolf demons stepped forward, bowing to the Black Wind Old Demon. \nwolf demons\tmale\tneutral\t“Yes, Chief!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping and Hu Mazi exchanged a glance, nodded, and followed the wolf demons out of the meeting hall.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOutside, \nHu Mazi\tmale\tconcerned\t“This Black Wind Old Demon is up to no good. He wants us and Green Snake Valley to destroy each other.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“I know,” \nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“It’s a chance to scout Green Snake Valley. Let’s head there and play it by ear.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe two followed the wolf demons, leaving Black Wind Stronghold and heading east towards Green Snake Valley.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAlong the way, the wolf demons kept provoking Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, clearly not taking them seriously.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping ignored their taunts, focusing on the journey.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter about half a day, a dense bamboo forest appeared ahead, shrouded in faint green mist that carried a strong snake stench.\nwolf demon\tmale\tneutral\t“That’s Green Snake Valley,” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tpointing at the forest. \nwolf demon\tmale\tneutral\t“The leader’s inside. Go in yourselves, we’ll wait here.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping knew the wolf demons were hoping to profit from their conflict, but he didn’t care. \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe turned to Hu Mazi. \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“Let’s go in.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThey entered the bamboo forest, where the mist grew thicker and the snake stench stronger.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter walking for about the time it takes to burn an incense stick, a massive valley appeared, filled with caves. The cave entrances were crawling with venomous snakes, exuding a dangerous aura.\nHu Mazi\tmale\tcautious\t“This is Green Snake Valley,” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tfrowning at the snakes. \nHu Mazi\tmale\tcautious\t“There’s probably no shortage of snake demons here.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Be careful. The Green Snake Valley leader is strong, we need to be ready,” \nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\t“Be careful. The Green Snake Valley leader is strong, we need to be ready,”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs they stepped into the valley, a hissing sound erupted. Countless venomous snakes slithered from the caves, swarming towards them.\nHu Mazi\tmale\tdetermined\t“I’ll handle these snakes!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tpulling out several talisman papers from his robe. He quickly drew fireball talismans and hurled them at the snakes.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe fireball talismans exploded in dazzling light, instantly reducing swathes of snakes to ashes.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut the snakes kept coming, wave after wave, crawling endlessly from the caves, overwhelming the pair.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tJust then, a cold voice echoed from the valley’s depths. \nGreen Snake Valley leader\tmale\tmenacing\t“Who dares trespass in my Green Snake Valley?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tA middle-aged man in a green robe emerged from the valley’s depths. His face was handsome but sinister, his lips curled in a cold smile. It was the Green Snake Valley leader.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing the burning snake corpses, anger flashed in his eyes. \nGreen Snake Valley leader\tmale\tangry\t“Did the Black Wind Old Demon send you?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“So what if he did?” \nChen Ping\tmale\tdefiant\t“So what if he did?” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Today’s your last day!”\nChen Ping\tmale\tdefiant\t“Today’s your last day!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe Green Snake Valley leader sneered. \nGreen Snake Valley leader\tmale\tsneering\t“Just you two? You’re overestimating yourselves!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHis form flickered, transforming into a massive green snake, dozens of metres long. It opened its jaws and lunged at them.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe green snake was lightning-fast, its attack carrying a fierce gust, reaching them in an instant.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIts mouth exuded a foul stench, dizzying and disorienting.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Watch out!” \nChen Ping\tmale\turgent\t“Watch out!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tsummoning his Dragon-Slaying Sword. A golden sword aura formed a barrier in front of them."
