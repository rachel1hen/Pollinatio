Fan\tfemale\tangry\t“Don’t think that just because you have two tricks, you feel invincible, this Brother Xiong is the left arm of the Red Dragon Gang’s leader, he is very capable of fighting, just like this, I guess two or three of them can’t beat him, do you still dare to stay?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“What’s there to be afraid of?” \nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“What’s there to be afraid of?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“You …………” \nWu Yi Fan\tfemale\tangry\t“You …………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWu Yifan was going to die of anger, finally she could only pull up Wang Han Han and desperately pull her away,\nWu Yi Fan\tfemale\tdesperate\t“Han Han, let’s go, really Let’s leave him alone, now that he has provoked the Red Dragon Gang, it’s definitely impossible for him to see the

to leave, but at this time Liao Fei Xiong had not yet arrived, he did not dare to make a sound, lest he be beaten up by Chen Ping!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWu Yifan had just left with Wang Hanhan when he saw several cars coming at speed and then stopped in front of the stall!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe owner of the stall was so frightened that he hid inside, and those who were eating and watching around him also dispersed, only some of them were brave enough to hide and watch from afar!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThey all knew the fame of Liao Fei Xiong, no one dared to provoke such a person, if not, they would lose their lives!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen the fat-headed man saw this, he hurriedly ran over and opened the door of the first car respectfully!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLiao Fei Xiong stepped down from the car with a cigar in his mouth, that faction looked at the crowd with a burst of envy!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Brother Xiong …………” \nfat-headed man\tmale\trespectful\t“Brother Xiong …………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing Liao Fei Xiong, the fat-headed man hurriedly shouted out, with an endless aggravation on his face!\nLiao Fei Xiong\tmale\tserious\t“Fatty, look at your appearance, you’re really a disgrace to the Red Dragon Gang!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLooking at the fat-headed man’s appearance, Liao Fei Xiong frowned and said,\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Where are the troublemakers?”\nLiao Fei

there ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe man pointed at Chen Ping and said!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLiao Fei Xiong followed the direction of his finger and when he saw that the person sitting there was actually Chen Ping, Liao Fei Xiong’s body shook slightly and the cigar in his mouth fell to the ground!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing that Liao Fei Xiong was so out of shape, the fat-headed man looked confused and hurriedly picked up his cigar and said,\nfat-headed man\tmale\tconfused\t“Brother Xiong, this guy is just one person, but he has some skills, those of my men were beaten ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLiao Fei Xiong was so angry in his heart, he wanted to scold this fat boy.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tEven Feng Sihai was defeated by a single kick, who in the whole Hongcheng could be Chen Ping’s opponent?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Brother Xiong!” \nChen Ping\tmale\tjoyful\t“Brother Xiong, it’s really fate that we meet
