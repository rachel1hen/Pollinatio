"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Yuqi was afraid that Chen Ping would interfere with Dr. Sun’s visit, so she roared in anger.\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tangry\t“What are you babbling about? You are not needed here, get lost quickly …………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter Chen Ping finished, he simply opened the compartment door and walked out.\nChen Ping\tmale\tconfident\t“Good, it’s you who told me to get lost, I’ll just sit outside in the corridor, in less than five minutes, you’ll definitely beg me to come back.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs Chen Ping walked back in, no one was bothering him as that Dr. Sun began to carefully perform acupuncture on Su Wen Zong, and soon he was dripping with sweat!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen the last needles were placed, Su Wenzong woke up leisurely and slowly opened his eyes!\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tjoyful\t“Dad, my dad has woken up, Dr. Sun, my dad has woken up, it’s great …………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing that Su Wenzong had woken up, Su Yuqi shouted happily, her eyes filled with tears!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tShe had just been really scared, scared that her father would never wake up again.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen Dr. Sun saw that Su Wenzong had woken up, he also let out a long breath, he was actually not sure of anything either!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut just as both Su Yuqi and Doctor Sun were breathing a sigh of relief, Su Wenzong, who had originally opened his eyes, suddenly shook violently, his expression was in great pain, having difficulty with each other, and his whole face had turned saucy purple!\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tpanicked\t“Dad …… Dad ……” \nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tpanicked\t“Dr. Sun, what’s going on ah? ”\nDr. Sun\tmale\tnervous\t“I …… don’t know either, how did this happen, how did this happen ……”\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tangry\t“Who are you asking? You are the doctor!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this moment, Su Wenzong’s trembling was getting smaller and smaller, and finally there was no movement at all directly, and even his breathing could not be probed.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this moment, that Dr. Sun panicked even more, if something happened to Su Wenzong, he was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to do well either.\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tsad\t“Dad, don’t scare me, don’t scare me …………”\nDr. Sun\tmale\tnervous\t“Miss Su, let’s take Mr. Su to the hospital, there’s nothing I can do!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe reason why he chose this time to send Su Wenzong to the hospital was just to avoid responsibility, if Su Wenzong died in the hospital, it would have nothing to do with him.\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tangry\t“Do you think I’m stupid? My dad is in this condition, can he still last until the hospital? You save it quickly, if you can’t save my dad, you don’t have to live either …………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Yuqi had lost her mind at this point, and her eyes were full of anger.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe Su family is the richest man in Jiangcheng, to deal with a small doctor, it is not a simple matter.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis scared that Dr. Sun, but there was nothing he could do, just when he was anxious, he suddenly thought of Chen Ping, Dr. Sun hurriedly said, \nDr. Sun\tmale\trespectful\t“Miss Su, that young man who just went out, maybe he really has a solution, I think that young man has two tricks up his sleeve!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen Dr. Sun said that, Su Yuqi also remembered Chen Ping, but just now that Dr. Sun had despised Chen Ping, but now he was praising him, just to get Chen Ping to come over and help her with the thunder!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs soon as Chen Ping did the healing, even if Su Wenzong died, he would not be found to be responsible, it was all Chen Ping’s responsibility alone.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Yuqi hesitated, but finally put Su Wenzong on a chair and rushed out of the private room!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this moment, Chen Ping was sitting on a chair in the corridor, he knew that Su Yuqi would definitely come out to look for him.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen Su Yuqi saw that Chen Ping hadn’t left yet, she hurriedly ran over, but just as she was about to open her mouth, she suddenly realized that she didn’t even know Chen Ping’s name.\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\trespectful\t“Please, please save my father …………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Yuqi had an embarra*sed look on her face as she begged at Chen Ping.\nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“You believe that I can save your father, that I am not a liar?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Yuqi didn’t say anything, she didn’t know how to answer, because at this moment Su Yuqi didn’t fully believe Chen Ping, she just didn’t have a choice, she was just treating a dead horse as a living horse!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLooking at Su Yuqi’s appearance, Chen Ping smiled and did not make things difficult for her, but got up and walked towards the private room.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Yuqi hurriedly followed behind her, while Dr. Sun was sweating profusely, anxiously walking inside the private room!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing Chen Ping coming, Dr. Sun seemed to have seen a saviour, no matter whether Chen Ping could cure Su Wenzong or not, as long as Chen Ping took a hand, then his own responsibility was even pushed out.\nDr. Sun\tmale\trespectful\t“Little brother, it was my fault just now, please save Mr. Su!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tCompared to the life of his own family, a few kind words were nothing!\nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\t“It seems that I can only put up a fight ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter Chen Ping finished speaking, he looked at that Doctor Sun and asked, \nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“Do you still have any silver needles?”\nDr. Sun\tmale\tnervous\t“Yes, it’s inside the medical box!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tDoctor Sun hurriedly took out a pack of silver needles and handed it to Chen Ping!\nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“It’s not enough!”\nDr. Sun\tmale\tsurprised\t“Not enough?” \nDr. Sun\tmale\tsurprised\t“This packet of silver needles has more than thirty of them, is it not enough?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tEven Zhou Jimin, the president of the Chinese Medicine a*sociation, who was known as a divine doctor, was only able to administer a dozen needles, so more than thirty silver needles were enough!\nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\t“Not enough, I need a lot of silver needles!”\nDr. Sun\tmale\tnervous\t“How many do you need?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\t“Ninety-eight hundred and eleven!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs soon as Chen Ping’s words fell, that Doctor Sun just froze, his entire body froze!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tA moment later, a trace of shock appeared in Dr. Sun’s eyes, but without saying anything, he directly took out all the silver needles from inside the medical box!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping took the silver needles and directly placed Su Wen Zong’s body on the ground and flattened it, followed by a wave of his hands as silver needles were continuously pushed into Su Wen Zong’s body!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping’s forehead began to break out in cold sweat, and his whole body looked so strained that his clothes were soaked through!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter the last silver needle was stuck into Su Wenzong’s body, Chen Ping let out a long breath and his whole body felt like it was deflated and he sat straight down on the ground.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tDuring this period, Su Yuqi had been fidgeting and watching, she didn’t know anything about acupuncture and wanted to ask, but she was afraid of disturbing Chen Ping.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut at that moment, Dr. Sun was already stunned on the spot, his mouth was so rounded that it could have been stuffed into an egg.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter a while, Dr. Sun turned from shock to excitement and knelt down in front of Chen Ping with a poof!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tDr. Sun’s sudden action had startled Chen Ping and Su Yuqi!"
