"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“I can’t, that’s the rule!” \nOne of the big men\tmale\tangry\t“I can’t, that’s the rule!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOne of the big men shook his head.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Since you can’t, then I’ll go ask your boss……”\nChen Ping\tmale\tconfident\t“Since you can’t, then I’ll go ask your boss……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping said, about to walk towards the manager’s office upstairs.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe four big men froze, they didn’t expect Chen Ping to be scared of them at all, and there was a bit of disdain on his face.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Seek death……”\nOne of the big men\tmale\tangry\t“Seek death……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWith that, the four big men made their moves together, their brightly shining daggers stabbing towards Chen Ping!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping didn’t even look at the four men, his palm gently waved, the four men’s wrists instantly felt smashed by something fierce, followed by the daggers in their hands dropping to the ground!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis time, the four men were dumbfounded, watching in shock as Chen Ping walked into the building and then towards the upper floors!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNone of them had reacted just now, they hadn’t even seen Chen Ping touch them, but the dagger in their hands had just fallen off, and each of them had a blood red mark on their wrists!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOnly when there was no trace of Chen Ping did the four big men react and hurriedly chased after him!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this moment, in the manager’s office, Liao Fei Xiong was looking out of the window, holding a cigar in one hand, his eyebrows slightly knitted together.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOriginally, the underground power of Hong City was divided into two, the Gathering of the Righteous and the Red Dragon Gang were equally powerful, while the other small gangs could be ignored.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHowever, some time ago, the leader of the Red Dragon Gang, Feng Sihai, was injured and all the matters of the Red Dragon Gang were handed over to Liao Fei Xiong, who did not dare to act rashly at the moment.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tEspecially when Liao Fei Xiong saw Chen Ping injure Feng Sihai with his own eyes, Chen Ping’s strength shocked Liao Fei Xiong, he didn’t know where Lin Tian Hu had found such a powerful helper!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut Feng Sihai has also gone to find his master Ye Fengchun, when the time comes, as long as Ye Fengchun arrives, then the Red Dragon Gang and the Gathering Hall will be on equal footing again!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBam……….\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tJust as Liao Fei Xiong was looking out the window, pondering the future of the Red Dragon Gang, suddenly there was a loud bang and the door to his office was kicked open!\nLiao Fei Xiong\tmale\tangry\tDamn it, who entered my office without knocking?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut as soon as Liao Fei Xiong’s words fell, when he turned his head, he froze, followed by a look of horror in his eyes!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBecause he saw Chen Ping, who had injured Feng Sihai, standing in front of him at that moment!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping didn’t know Liao Feixiong, after all, at Gu Mantian’s banquet, Feng Sihai had brought many people with him, but all of them didn’t make a move, only Feng Sihai followed Chen Ping and made a move, only to be injured by Chen Ping!\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\tYou are the manager of this Xian He Zhuang?\nLiao Fei Xiong\tmale\tnervous\tYes, I am the manager, I don’t know what you want?\nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\tJust now your men said that someone was buying my life, I came over to ask, who exactly wants to buy my life?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping pulled a chair while sitting directly on it!\nLiao Fei Xiong\tmale\tsurprised\tBuy your life?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLiao Fei Xiong frowned slightly, but then his eyes snapped open and his entire body began to tremble slightly!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe remembered that Xing Jun had asked him to kill a person, it couldn’t be such a coincidence that the person that Xing Jun wanted to kill was this devil in front of him, right?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tJust when Liao Fei Xiong didn’t know how to answer, those four big men also hurriedly ran in!\nOne of the big men\tmale\trespectful\tBrother Xiong, this kid has some strength, the four of us are surprisingly no match for him, let him run up……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis time, Liao Fei Xiong almost didn’t sit down on the ground, so it seems that the person that Xing Jun told him to kill is really this Chen Ping in front of him!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLiao Fei Xiong regretted it, if he knew it was Chen Ping, he wouldn’t have dared to give him any money, not to mention a million!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tFeng Sihai was so powerful, but he was still killed by Chen Ping with just one kick!"
