I am a person who would rather bend than break……” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping also had a few deep smiles on his face!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tXing Jun just smiled and didn’t say anything else, because after a while, he would know if this Chen Ping would bend ……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping occupied a position, Cui Zhiyuan could only helplessly sit to Xing Jun’s left, and Sun Xiaomeng sat right next to Cui Zhiyuan!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIf it wasn’t for Chen Ping, that position would have been hers. If Xing Jun had been happy today, maybe Cui Zhiyuan would have been transferred to the purchasing department, and she would have been the sales manager!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNow Sun Xiaomeng regretted bringing Chen Ping into the company. If he had known this, he would not have agreed to introduce Chen Ping into the company. This is not to find trouble for himself!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Chen Ping, if it wasn’t for Mr. Xing, would you have been able to enter the company? Can you sit here and eat? Let me tell you, just like you, you will never be able to eat at Xian He Zhuang for the rest of your life, rubbish……”\nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tangry\t“Chen Ping, if it wasn’t for Mr. Xing, would you have been able to enter the company? Can you sit here and eat? Let me tell you, just like you, you will never be able to eat at Xian He Zhuang for the rest of your life, rubbish……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNow was the right time to show loyalty to Xing Jun, of course Cui Zhiyuan wouldn’t let go of such a good opportunity!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSnap!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHowever, just as Cui Zhiyuan’s words landed, he was slapped directly in the face immediately afterwards!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis slap instantly shocked the crowd!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tEveryone looked at Cui Zhiyuan in a dazed and confused manner, while Cui Zhiyuan himself looked at Chen Ping with wide eyes, incredulously. He didn’t expect Chen Ping to dare to hit him!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAnd Xing Jun, who was sitting in the middle, frowned slightly. This Chen Ping had directly hit Cui Zhiyuan in front of himself. This was not taking himself into consideration at all!\nChen Ping\tmale\tcold\t“This slap is just to teach you a lesson. I won’t move you just for the sake of Uncle Sun. If you dare to disrespect me again, I’ll rip your head off……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping coldly glanced at that Cui Zhiyuan, with a strong killing intent in his eyes!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWith this glance, Cui Zhiyuan was frightened enough. His body trembled slightly, and his whole body was like falling into an ice cave.\nSun Xiaomeng\tmale\tangry\t“Chen Ping, are you crazy? Why did you hit Zhiyuan?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Chen Ping, you even dare to hit Manager Cui. I think you don’t want to work anymore!”\nunknown\tunknown\tangry\t“Chen Ping, you even dare to hit Manager Cui. I think you don’t want to work anymore!”\nunknown\tunknown\tangry\t“Against, simply against the sky, a small salesman, how dare he hit the sales manager, he must be fired……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe crowd spoke for Cui Zhiyuan, bending over backwards!\nWang Lanlan\tfemale\tangry\t“Chen Ping, kneel down and apologize to Manager Cui now. Maybe he can forgive you and let you stay in the company, or you will definitely be fired!”\nWang Han Han\tfemale\tsurprised\t“Brother Chen Ping…………” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWang Han Han looked at Chen Ping, somewhat at a loss for words. She also didn’t expect Chen Ping to suddenly strike at Cui Zhiyuan!\nChen Ping\tmale\tconfident\t“Firing me?” \nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\t“Just by virtue of him, he is not qualified to fire me. The titled Great Manager Xing is here, where he has the right to speak for a sales department manager!”\nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tangry\t“Chen Ping, I’ll get you to death……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tCui Zhiyuan roared loudly after a moment of shock. Not daring how scared he was at this time, he had to act fearlessly, or else he, the sales manager, would have no place in the hearts of his staff!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tPOW!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tCui Zhiyuan’s words had just fallen and was about to rush towards Chen Ping when Chen Ping flung another slap at him!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping was so fast that Cui Zhiyuan didn’t even have time to dodge!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut while Chen Ping was hitting Cui Zhiyuan, his eyes were looking at Xing Jun with a provocative look in them!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOnly Xing Jun’s face was grim as he didn’t move a muscle!\nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tangry\t“Chen Ping, I……”"
