"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“This is… the talisman inheritance of your ancestors!”\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“The runes on the stone tablet form a vast inheritance array. As long as someone with the Hu clan’s bloodline approaches, it can activate the inheritance. Come here quickly!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHu Mazi hurriedly stepped forward to the stone tablet, pressing the clan leader’s token against it.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe stone tablet instantly erupted with a radiant glow, countless runes flying out from it, swirling around Hu Mazi like fireflies, slowly merging into his body.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHu Mazi felt a flood of talisman knowledge filling his mind, from the basics of crafting talisman paper to the advanced techniques of arranging talisman arrays, encompassing everything.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHis body was also undergoing changes; the spiritual energy within him became purer, and previously blocked meridians were gently cleared by a warm force, his cultivation level gradually rising.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“This… this is real!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHu Mazi, feeling the changes within him, was so excited he could barely speak.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping stood guard nearby, also absorbing the stray talisman knowledge emanating from the stone tablet.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThough he lacked the Hu clan’s bloodline and couldn’t receive the full inheritance, the scattered information greatly benefited him, deepening his understanding of talismans and faintly touching a new realm.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter an unknown amount of time, the light from the stone tablet gradually faded. Hu Mazi opened his eyes, a glint of brilliance flashing in them, his aura significantly stronger than before, having directly broken through to the Earth Immortal Realm!\nHu Mazi\tmale\texcited\t“I’ve broken through!”\nHu Mazi\tmale\tgrateful\t“Thanks for the reminder, lad, or I’d have missed this inheritance!”\nChen Ping\tmale\tmatter-of-fact\t“It’s you awakening the strength you already had. Relying solely on the inheritance, your power wouldn’t have grown this quickly.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping knew that Hu Mazi had always been strong, but after several reincarnations, his strength seemed sealed.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNow, with the power of this inheritance, part of Hu Mazi’s strength had been unlocked, allowing him to swiftly reach the Earth Immortal Realm.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHu Mazi’s strength would only grow stronger in the future.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping’s gaze fell on a line of small text at the base of the stone tablet, \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“It seems we need to hurry. The tablet says that the core area of the Burial Demon Abyss seals an ancient demon general. The seal is now extremely weak, and if it breaks free, the consequences will be dire.”\nHu Mazi\tmale\tconcerned\t“That treasure Youyue wants, could it be in the core area?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“Very likely.”\nChen Ping\tmale\tserious\t“The demon clan has always wanted to release the creature at the bottom of the abyss. The treasure Youyue sent us to retrieve might be something that can control the demon general.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWe must find the treasure before her people arrive, or the consequences will be unthinkable.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe two didn’t dare delay and continued deeper along the passage behind the stone tablet.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe passage grew narrower, the demonic energy increasingly dense, but with the talisman runes left by the Hu clan ancestors and the clan leader’s token on Hu Mazi, the demonic energy couldn’t touch them.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter about half an hour, they reached a lava pool ahead. Dark red lava churned in the pool, emitting scorching heat that turned the surrounding rock walls red-hot.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThere was no bridge over the lava pool, only a few thick iron chains connecting to the other side, covered in rust and looking like they might snap at any moment.\nHu Mazi\tmale\tconcerned\t“How do we get across?”\nHu Mazi\tmale\tconcerned\t“The chains are too thin, they can’t possibly hold our weight.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt that moment, they couldn’t fly and had to proceed on foot, making the lava pool a deadly obstacle.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping observed the surroundings of the lava pool and noticed protruding stones on the rock walls at intervals, each engraved with runes. \nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“These stones are footholds. The runes on them can resist the heat. We can step on them to cross.”"
