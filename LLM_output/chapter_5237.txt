"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“What’s that?” \nHu Mazi\tmale\tagitated\tWhat did you say? Does this mean my clansmen’s divine souls are still intact?\nYou Wuji\tmale\tneutral\tThey should be. The cultivation techniques of the Evil Path Hall are rather peculiar, capable of refining others’ divine souls for their own use.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“He took so many divine souls from the Hu clan, it’s unlikely he could refine them all at once. Some might still be imprisoned.”\nHu Mazi\tmale\tjoyful\tTears of excitement welled up in Hu Mazi’s eyes, “That’s wonderful… wonderful… As long as their divine souls remain, my clansmen still have a chance for revival!”\nChen Ping\tmale\trespectful\t“Master Hu, rest assured, we will definitely rescue your clansmen’s divine souls and let them find peace.”\nYou Wuji\tmale\tneutral\t“I can help too. I can find a chance to ask my brother and probe into the whereabouts of the Hu clan’s divine souls.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“You know, the Evil Path Hall has branches everywhere, collecting spirits and divine souls. Without someone to gather information, it would be very difficult for you to find them.”\nYou Wuji\tmale\tneutral\tHe said this purely to save his own skin, knowing that only by being useful could he preserve his life!\nChen Ping\tmale\tcold\t“I’ll spare your wretched life for now, but if you dare to play tricks, I guarantee your soul will be utterly destroyed, never to find peace.”\nYou Wuji\tmale\tterrified\t“I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare! Rest assured, Mr. Chen, I will do my utmost to gather information, without the slightest deceit!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe had long been terrified by Nan Batian, and now, preserving his life was already a stroke of fortune. He dared not entertain other thoughts, letting out a long sigh as cold sweat soaked his back.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHu Mazi, listening nearby, gritted his teeth in anger, the deep blood feud of his clansmen surging in his heart. His gaze fell on the trembling Youyue Witch, a flash of ruthlessness in his eyes.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe strode towards Youyue, who turned pale with fright, shrinking back behind You Wuji.\nYouyue\tfemale\tfearful\t“Father, save me!” \nYou Wuji\tmale\tterrified\tYou Wuji’s eyelids twitched wildly, but he kept his head down, not daring to meet Hu Mazi’s gaze.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHis own life was in others’ hands, so how could he care about his daughter’s fate? He could only pretend not to hear, his fingernails digging deep into his palms to mask his inner humiliation.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHu Mazi yanked Youyue from behind You Wuji, dragging her like a dead dog into the side hall nearby.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tYouyue’s cries soon turned to stifled sobs, followed by moans of pleasure.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOutside the side hall, You Wuji’s body trembled slightly, yet he never dared utter a word.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping watched coldly, not intervening. Some debts had to be repaid.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe was, however, quite impressed with Hu Mazi’s prowess in bed!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHalf an hour later, Hu Mazi emerged from the side hall, a satisfied expression on his face. Youyue followed behind, her gaze towards Hu Mazi devoid of anger or hatred, instead carrying a hint of contentment.\nHu Mazi\tmale\tneutral\t“Chen Ping, let’s go,” \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\tturning to You Wuji, “You have three days. I want to know the exact whereabouts of the Hu clan’s divine souls. I’ll come for you in three days.”\nYou Wuji\tmale\tterrified\t“Yes, yes!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe three left the Black Fiend Demon Palace. \nNan Batian\tmale\tserious\t“Most of the forces in Jiupan Mountain are colluding with the Black Fiend Demon Palace. Some even participated in the Hu clan’s destruction back then. Why not take this chance to wipe them all out?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tcold\t“I was thinking the same! Since we’re making a move, let’s root them out completely to avoid future trouble.”\nHu Mazi\tmale\teager\t“It’s long overdue!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe three immediately began dealing with the forces of Jiupan Mountain. With Nan Batian present, smaller forces were eradicated with a wave of his hand.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIn less than a day, most of the dozens of forces, large and small, in Jiupan Mountain were wiped out, blood flowing like rivers, cries echoing everywhere.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThose forces that once thrived under the Black Fiend Demon Palace’s protection had no chance to beg for mercy before being utterly annihilated."
