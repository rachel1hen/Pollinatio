"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“What are you trying to do?” Su Yuqi hurriedly stepped forward to block Su Wenzong, but by now Chen Ping had already withdrawn his hand.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHowever, Su Wenzong immediately felt his breathing flowing smoothly and his face was much rosier after Chen Ping had struck a few acupuncture points.\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“I have only temporarily controlled your injuries, it will take some time for them to heal, your hidden illness needs to be adjusted slowly because of its age!”\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tjoyful\t“Thank you little brother for saving me, thank you so much……” \nSu Wenzong went forward and excitedly grabbed Chen Ping’s hand and kept thanking him.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Yuqi was also surprised to see that his father’s face was visibly rosy and his health was much better.\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“I stepped in to save you because I know that you often do good deeds and have donated to a dozen primary schools, so I should do so for reasons!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe reason why Chen Ping saved Su Wenzong was because he knew that Su Wenzong was a great benefactor, if it was someone he met in person and knew nothing about, Chen Ping would not necessarily have stepped in to save him, not to mention the fact that just now Su Yuqi had badmouthed him and almost ran him over, Chen Ping was not a saintly bitch who would save anyone!\nSu Wenzong\tmale\trespectful\t“This little thing I did, it’s not a good deed, it’s not even close, little brother saved my life, just say what you want, it’s almost noon now, how about I treat little brother to a meal at Regal Hotel?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“No need, I still have some things to take care of!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping shook his head and refused, he still had to go see Geng Shanshan to ask for clarification.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing Chen Ping’s refusal, Su Wenzong was still a little surprised, knowing that as the richest man in Hongcheng, there were countless people who wanted to invite him to dinner, and those who could sit with him for dinner were all powerful and noble people.\nSu Wenzong\tmale\trespectful\t“Little brother, say what we have to sit and have a meal together to show my gratitude!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Wenzong pulled Chen Ping’s arm with a deadly grip.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping could tell that Su Wenzong was desperately trying to invite himself to dinner, just because he wanted to know about the follow-up treatment for his illness, but seeing that Su Wenzong was kind of sincere, Chen Ping nodded and said, \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“In that case, I’ll go take care of things first, and I’ll look for you at the Regal Hotel then!”\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tjoyful\t“Alright then, it’s a deal, when little brother arrives, just call me!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping nodded and couldn’t wait to leave, heading for the Geng family!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Where’s Geng Shanshan? I want to see her!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIn front of a slightly outdated villa, Chen Ping said to the middle-aged woman in front of him!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis middle-aged woman was Geng Shanshan’s mother Jia Mei, if it was before, Chen Ping would have never dared to follow Jia Mei with such a tone of voice, but now after listening to his own mother’s complaint, Chen Ping had long been so angry that it was good that he didn’t make a direct move.\nJia Mei\tfemale\tcold\t“You quickly get out of here, my daughter is getting married today, it’s too bad luck for you, a reformed prisoner of labor, to be here……”\nChen Ping\tmale\tangry\t“Marriage?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping’s brow furrowed, it seemed that the bald man was telling the truth!\nChen Ping\tmale\tangry\t“Where is Geng Shanshan? Who is she married to? Let her come out to see me and tell me clearly……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping grimaced coldly and rushed towards the villa!\nJia Mei\tfemale\tangry\t“Hey …… you crazy person, how can you just barge into someone’s yard?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tJia Mei desperately pulled at Chen Ping!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut how could she be stronger than Chen Ping, her entire body was dragged into the courtyard by Chen Ping!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs Chen Ping was about to rush in, a girl in a wedding dress came out with a gloomy face!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tUpon seeing the girl, Chen Ping stopped for a moment.\nChen Ping\tmale\tangry\t“Geng Shanshan, what the hell is going on here? What’s going on? Tell me clearly?”\nGeng Shanshan\tfemale\tcold\t“Chen Ping, go away, don’t come looking for me, I’ve decided to marry Xiao Lei!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping’s eyes gaped and he clenched his fists tightly, although he already knew, but when Geng Shanshan said it herself, Chen Ping’s heart still twitched hard.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe had been sent to jail by that Xiao Lei, but now his girlfriend was going to marry him?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis was too ironic!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSuddenly, Chen Ping gave a bitter laugh to himself, he felt that he was really too cheap ……\nChen Ping\tmale\tsad\t“Is this your own intention?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping looked at Geng Shanshan, his face was no longer angry, his hands slowly loosened.\nGeng Shanshan\tfemale\tcold\t“Yes!” \nGeng Shanshan\tfemale\tcold\t“I want to have had the life of a rich man, and you simply can’t give me that.”\nGeng Shanshan\tfemale\tcold\t“And you’re still a reformed prisoner, even if you get out, I’m afraid you can hardly even support yourself, what can you do to support me?”\nGeng Shanshan\tfemale\tcold\t“For the sake of our previous relationship, take these few hundred dollars, save yourself from sleeping in the street!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter Geng Shanshan finished speaking, she took out a few hundred yuan bills from her bag and slammed them in Chen Ping’s face!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this moment, Chen Ping looked at Geng Shanshan and was completely dead, the person in front of him was no longer his girlfriend.\nChen Ping\tmale\tangry\t“You’ll regret it!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping turned around and left after he finished speaking, and did not take Geng Shanshan’s money.\nJia Mei\tfemale\tmocking\t“Bah, you’ll regret it only if you marry a poor man like you!”"
