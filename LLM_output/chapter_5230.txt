"narrator\tfemale\tneutral\t“Be your servant?” \nChen Ping\tmale\tsneering\t“If I let you be my servant, I’d still find your strength lacking, a mere fifth-rank Earth Immortal, you’re nothing!”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tChen Ping wasn’t boasting. In the Heavenly Ladder, the people he saved; Nan Batian, Li Chunfeng, Shen Zhiyan, Mu Sha were all stronger than this Black Bear Daoist!\nBlack Bear Daoist\tmale\tferocious\t“Oh? Quite the bragger, are you?” \nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tA ferocious grin spread across Black Bear Daoist’s face, \nBlack Bear Daoist\tmale\tferocious\t“Then don’t blame me for being rude!”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tIn a flash, his massive fist tore through the air with a whistling sound, smashing towards Chen Ping.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tThe aura of a fifth-rank Earth Immortal pressed down like a mountain, making it hard for Chen Ping to breathe.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tChen Ping felt a tremendous force hit him, his arm went numb, and he was forced back repeatedly, blood trickling from his mouth.\nBlack Bear Daoist\tmale\tsurprised\t“Seventh-rank Loose Immortal? Not bad, kid, surviving my punch,” \nBlack Bear Daoist\tmale\tdisdainful\t“But in front of me, you’re still too weak.”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tHe charged again, his fists raining down on Chen Ping like a storm.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tChen Ping could barely defend himself, quickly falling into a disadvantage, new wounds appearing on his body.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tHu Mazi wanted to help but was pinned down by Black Bear Daoist’s aura, unable to approach.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tJust as Chen Ping was about to collapse, a booming voice rang out, \nnarrator\tmale\tauthoritative\t“Black Bear Cub, bullying my benefactor, Nan Batian? Did you ask me first?”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tBefore the voice faded, a towering figure descended like a meteor, standing in front of Chen Ping. The man was nearly three metres tall, muscular, with a defiant grin, it was Nan Batian!\nBlack Bear Daoist\tmale\tugly\t“Why are you here?”\nNan Batian\tmale\tdefiant\t“The Fifth Heaven is vast, I go where I please. Do I need to report to you?”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tHe turned to Chen Ping with a warm smile, \nNan Batian\tmale\twarm\t“Mr. Chen, long time no see. Are you alright?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tgrateful\t“Nan Batian? How… how are you here? And your strength…”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tHe could sense that Nan Batian’s power had reached the peak of seventh-rank Earth Immortal, far stronger than when they were in the Heavenly Ladder.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tBack then, Nan Batian’s strength was suppressed in the Heavenly Ladder, with no resources to cultivate.\nNan Batian\tmale\theartily\t“It’s a long story. After leaving the Celestial Realm, I came to the Fifth Heaven and have been cultivating. Didn’t expect to run into you so soon, Mr. Chen.”\nNan Batian\tmale\timpressed\t“Your strength has grown fast too, still fighting above your rank as always, so impressive, reaching the Fifth Heaven as a Loose Immortal.”\nChen Ping\tmale\tsheepish\t“Embarrassed, embarrassed, I almost got killed just now!”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tNan Batian turned to Black Bear Daoist, his face turning ice-cold, \nNan Batian\tmale\tice-cold\t“Black Bear Cub, what were you about to do to Mr. Chen?”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tNan Batian, a seventh-rank Earth Immortal, was calling Chen Ping “Mr. Chen” and seemed to know him well.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tNow, Black Bear Daoist didn’t think Chen Ping’s earlier words were just bragging.\nBlack Bear Daoist\tmale\tfearful\t“Nan Batian, don’t mess around! I’m the lord of Black Wind Ridge, backed by…”\nNan Batian\tmale\taggressive\t“Backed by your mum, it’s no use!”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral\tNan Batian cut him off, flashing forward and sending Black Bear Daoist flying with a single punch."
