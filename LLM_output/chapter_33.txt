"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tCome in, you two!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Wentian nodded slightly towards Chen Ping as a greeting!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIn his opinion, a young backwoodsman in his early twenties who could be called sir by Lin Tianhu must have had money and power in his family to be so respected by Lin Tianhu, not because he had strength!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu and Chen Ping walked into Gu Mantian’s mansion, and once they entered, Chen Ping felt a burst of dense aura coming over him, and in the courtyard several large trees, which were as thick as a hug, blocked out a large area of sunlight!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs he continued to walk forward, the rockery, the buildings and pavilions were each emitting a strong aura of antiquity!\nChen Ping\tmale\tcurious\tAncient these trees, they have years, right?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping looked at the large trees and couldn’t help but ask.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBecause all of this dense aura was emanating from these big trees!\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tinformative\tMr. Chen, these ancient trees, all of them are hundreds of years old, and it is because of these trees that the ancient courtyard was built here.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu followed Chen Ping and explained!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping nodded slightly, he could understand the reason why Gu Wentian, the provincial governor, had chosen to come to this small Hongcheng to spend his old age in peace!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis place had an abundance of spiritual energy, so it was indeed suitable for retirement, and living here for a long time, nourished by the spiritual energy, the body would become more and more youthful and hardened!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter pa*sing through a corridor, Gu Mantian led Lin Tianhu and Chen Ping into the hall. The whole hall was filled with ancient furniture, each of which was hundreds of years old, and there was even a dragon chair carved with nine huge dragons placed in the middle of the hall!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThere was a golden cushion on top of the dragon chair, it looked like someone often sat on it!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping looked at the dragon chair and frowned slightly, his expression turning a little odd!\nGu Wentian\tmale\twelcoming\tYou two sit down!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Wentian casually waved his hand before sitting himself directly on top of that dragon chair!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter Lin Tianhu and Chen Ping took their seats, Gu Wentian had his subordinates pour tea!\nGu Wentian\tmale\taccommodating\tMaster Tiger, there is no matter what, if there is anything I need to help you with, just say it!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Wentian knew that Lin Tianhu had come, he must have something to ask him!\nChen Ping\tmale\tinquiring\tWe know that Ancient loves collecting, so we would like to ask Ancient if there are any spirit pens here, the brushes used by the great literary figures in ancient times, and vermilion made from animal blood!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu looked at Chen Ping, who spoke, \nLin Tianhu\tmale\tassuring\tAncient, of course we won’t ask for ancient things for nothing, as long as ancient has them here, the price is whatever ancient asks, I, Lin Tianhu, will never return the favor!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu hurriedly said in order to keep Ancient Man Tian from having any worries.\nGu Wentian\tmale\tthoughtful\tSpiritual pens?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAncient Man Tian pondered with a slight frown.\nGu Wentian\tmale\treassuring\tWhat are you talking about, Master Tiger? If I had it, there would be no harm in giving it to you, does money mean anything to me?\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tagreeing\tYes, yes, yes, Ancient regards money like dirt!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu nodded his head repeatedly.\nGu Wentian\tmale\tinformative\tThings like brushes are inherently consumable, so it’s almost impossible to keep used brushes, and as for that vermilion made from animal blood, I’ve never even heard of it.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Wentian shook his head, but then continued, \nGu Wentian\tmale\thinting\tBut to find such things, perhaps there are more among the Daoist temples than I have here, after all, these Daoist priests need to draw charms to drive away ghosts, and the brushes they use might have a spiritual nature!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe had forgotten about this, the brushes used by those Daoist priests to drive away ghosts and draw charms must have spiritual properties, including the vermilion sand used, he could just go to the Daoist temple to look for them, why come to the Antique Street to look around!\nChen Ping\tmale\tgrateful\tThanks for the ancient reminder!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping got up and gave a salute towards Gu Wentian!\nGu Wentian\tmale\tamused\tHahaha, you’re welcome, I was just mentioning it casually!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Mantian laughed!\nChen Ping\tmale\tinquiring\tAncient, dare I ask where the dragon chair beneath you comes from?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping asked.\nGu Wentian\tmale\tproud\tWhat? Do you also see that this dragon chair is extraordinary?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Mantian said with a proud look on his face, \nGu Wentian\tmale\tproud\tI spent a lot of money to purchase this dragon chair back from abroad, it is a real dragon chair, something from the Ming Dynasty, the true Dragon Emperor sat on it.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Mantian gently stroked the dragon chair beneath him, and it was clear that he was very fond of it."
