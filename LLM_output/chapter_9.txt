"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Wenzong said hurriedly.\nSu Wenzong\tmale\trespectful\t“Mr. Chen, whatever you need, just ask, as long as I can do it, I will never refuse!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Mr. Chen, what are the brushes and vermilion on this list for?” At this moment, Su Yuqi asked.\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tcurious\t“Mr. Chen, what are the brushes and vermilion on this list for?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Yuqi, since Mr. Chen has written on it, he has his own reasons, no talking too much!” Su Wenzong said as he glared at Su Yuqi.\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tserious\t“Yuqi, since Mr. Chen has written on it, he has his own reasons, no talking too much!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“No harm!” Chen Ping smiled, \nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“These two are also for healing, but they are not ordinary brushes and vermilion, they need brushes and vermilion with a spiritual nature to work!”\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tsurprised\t“With spirituality?” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis time Su Yuqi was baffled! Su Wenzong was also baffled, they didn’t understand what was with spirituality at all.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing that both of them were baffled, Chen Ping explained, \nChen Ping\tmale\tpatient\t“All things in this world are born and perish, and everything has a spiritual nature, even the dead things seen in the world, such as a table and a chair here, can have a spiritual nature, but that requires special harsh conditions and opportunities!”\nChen Ping\tmale\tpatient\t“For example, this chair I made, if I sit on this chair for years and years to practise, for ten years, fifty years, or even a hundred years, this chair will slowly have a spiritual nature.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping was afraid that the two people would not understand, so he could only follow them in a particularly colloquial manner.\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tjoyful\t“Oh, I get it!” \nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tjoyful\t“Mr. Chen means that it is like what is shown on TV, a tree in a god’s cave can have a spiritual nature over time and even transform into a human form!”\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tangry\t“Yuqi, don’t talk nonsense!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs far as he was concerned, there was no such thing as a god in this world, what century was this?\nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“Miss Su’s explanation is correct, that’s what it means ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIn the past, Chen Ping did not believe in it either, but after following the old dragon head for these three years, he realized that in this world, there existed too many things that he did not know.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tFor example, the Heart Condensation Technique that Old Leader had passed on to him was an immortal cultivation technique, and once Chen Ping had cultivated it, he would really become a god!\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tembarrassed\tSu Wenzong smiled awkwardly, not expecting Su Yuqi to be right.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIf someone else had said something like spirituality or immortality, Su Wenzong would have scoffed, but Chen Ping said it, which made Su Wenzong a bit shaken!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping and Su Wen Zong talked without looking at Sun Song, who was kneeling on the ground.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAlthough Sun Song was not particularly bad in human nature, he could hardly take responsibility, and Chen Ping did not want to accept him.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter talking for about ten minutes, Chen Ping found out how Su Wenzong had been injured.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIt turned out that when Su Wenzong was young, he had been slapped by a business rival.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHowever, after a short time, Su Wenzong felt that his body was getting weaker and weaker, and he often had difficulty in breathing, so he had been taking some great tonic medicines to support himself until now.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHowever, Su Wenzong was afraid that his family would worry, so he kept it hidden, which was why Su Yuqi did not know that her father had a hidden illness.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs soon as Chen Ping heard it, he understood that the person who had injured Su Wenzong must be a martial artist, one who had already cultivated internal energy, and it looked like he wanted to kill Su Wenzong, only that Su Wenzong had money and relied on the great tonic medicine he had bought with heavy money to support him until now, and if he hadn’t met himself, Su Wenzong was afraid that he wouldn’t have survived at all.\nSun Song\tmale\tdesperate\t“I beg Mr. Chen to take me as his disciple …………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSun Song, who was kneeling on the ground, shouted once again.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this moment, his legs had long since gone numb, accompanied by a painful sensation, making it very difficult for Sun Song now.\nChen Ping\tmale\tfirm\t“Get up, I won’t accept a disciple, but if you don’t understand something, I can point you out!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing that Sun Song had knelt for such a long time and was sincere, Chen Ping agreed to instruct him, but he would never accept a disciple.\nSun Song\tmale\tgrateful\t“Thank you Mr. Chen, thank you Mr. Chen …………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing Chen Ping say this, Sun Song’s heart was happy and he thanked him repeatedly,\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSun Song slowly stood up, but his legs were numb and painful, making him unable to stand at all!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing this situation of Sun Song, Chen Ping reached out his hand and nudged Sun Song’s legs, the painful numbness, instantly disappeared, which made Sun Song shocked!\nChen Ping\tmale\trespectful\t“Mr. Su, there are still parents at home, I have to go back, when the herbs are ready, you can call me!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping’s mother was still at home alone, which made him uneasy.\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tcurious\t“Mr. Chen, I wonder where you are staying now?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“Living in the Happiness Lane district, what’s wrong?”\nSu Wenzong\tmale\trespectful\t“Oh, nothing, I just have a house that has been sitting idle and useless, so I’ll give it to Mr. Chen, that place is also particularly suitable for convalescence, I hope it will be useful to Mr. Chen!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Wenzong said, pulling out a key from his pocket!\nChen Ping\tmale\tgrateful\t“Then, thank you, Mr. Su!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping originally wanted to refuse, he didn’t give Su Wenzong a medical treatment to get anything, but when he thought of his parents living in that shabby house, he was afraid that it would be some time before he could earn money to buy a house, so he agreed to do so.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut when the key was handed over to Chen Ping, Chen Ping froze, it was a key to the villa area of Pan Long Bay."
