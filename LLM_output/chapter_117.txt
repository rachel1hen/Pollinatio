I should have known I would have taken a Bentley with you, I’ve never been in one before……”\nWang Han Han\tmale\tnervous\tBut after saying that, he instantly felt something was wrong, so he apologetically smiled towards Sun Xiaomeng and said, “Sister Xiaomeng, I didn’t mean that, it’s quite good to ride in your car too……”\nSun Xiaomeng\tfemale\tcalm\t“It’s fine!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSun Xiaomeng didn’t care, she knew Wang Hanhan didn’t mean any harm!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIt was just that Sun Xiaomeng’s eyes kept looking at Chen Ping, not understanding how Chen Ping could come in a Bentley?\nSun Xiaomeng\tfemale\tcurious\t“Chen Ping, whose Bentley are you riding in?” \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“A friend’s!” \nSun Xiaomeng\tfemale\tsurprised\t“You still have a friend who can afford a Bentley?” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis made Sun Xiaomeng a little unnerved!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tA Bentley cost several million at least, and in a small city like Hongcheng, there really weren’t many people who could spend several million on a car!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBefore Chen Ping could answer, Cui Zhiyuan and the others also arrived, seven or eight cars parked in the car park, looking at the Xian He Zhuang in front of them, all in awe.\nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tmocking\t“Tong Jian, put your broken car somewhere else, don’t park it here, it’s a disgrace to us……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tZhang Tongjian had no choice but to drive the car away, while Cui Zhiyuan and the others put on a bashful look and walked towards the inside of Xianhezhuang.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tJust as they reached the entrance, they saw Sun Xiaomeng and Chen Ping, which stunned the crowd!\nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tsurprised\t“Chen Ping?
