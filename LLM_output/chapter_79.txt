"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis was his secret, he had never told anyone about it at all.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIn the eyes of outsiders, he had a beautiful family with a harmonious husband and wife, only he himself knew that when it came to night, he was in deep pain!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNow that Chen Ping had hit the sore spot, this made the interviewer burst into a rage and the veins on his forehead bulged!\ninterviewer\tmale\tangry\t“You’re talking nonsense, you don’t have the ability to be a man, I have a wife, I have children, my family is very happy ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe interviewer growled loudly, deliberately putting extra weight on the children as a way to refute Chen Ping and prove that he was talking nonsense!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping laughed: \nChen Ping\tmale\tmocking\t“Even if you have a child, it is not your own, either you picked it up or your daughter-in-law had it with someone else, because your problem fell from childhood, and it was also due to an accident, caused by an external force that made you lose your ability to be a man!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBoom\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tJust as Chen Ping finished his words, that interviewer viciously slapped the table and stood up, looking angrily at Chen Ping and said, \ninterviewer\tmale\tangry\t“You kid investigating me?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis interviewer had indeed lost his manhood because he had been kicked in the crotch by a donkey as a child, and had simply picked up a child after getting married.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThese things, apart from those people in his old family who knew about it, no one in Hongcheng would even know about it, and he had purposely stayed away from his old family for this reason, but to his surprise, Chen Ping had directly told him about it!\nChen Ping\tmale\tcold\t“You’re not worthy of my investigation yet!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut that interviewer’s words were also side evidence that what Chen Ping had said was true, which at once made several colleagues at the scene look at that interviewer with strange eyes!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe interviewer also seemed to feel that he had said the wrong thing, and immediately became irritated and rushed towards Chen Ping!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing that the interview was about to turn into a fight, Cui Zhiyuan could only shout angrily, \nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tangry\t“Enough, sit back down ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe interviewer could only give Chen Ping a fierce glare and then sat back down!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tCui Zhiyuan only wanted his men to humiliate Chen Ping and then just tell him that he was unsuitable, but he didn’t expect things to turn out this way, which made Cui Zhiyuan a little angry in his heart!\nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tangry\t“Kid, you’re not suitable to work in our company, you don’t even want to show us the door with this status, better get lost and don’t come back in the future ……”\ninterviewer\tmale\tangry\t“Such a sizeable company, to have employees like you, it’s really time to rectify things ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping sneered and got up to walk out, he didn’t really want to work here!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut just as Chen Ping got up and was about to walk out the door, suddenly a tall young man, wearing a suit and with a cold face walked in!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe youth carried a bit of authority on his body and swept a glance at Chen Ping as soon as he entered the door!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping also looked at the youth, and then prepared to leave!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut who knew that the youth would stop him, \nyouth\tmale\tserious\t“Are you Chen Ping?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping looked at the youth in confusion and nodded slightly, he didn’t know the man in front of him!\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t(nodded slightly)\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut if Chen Ping’s parents were there, they would definitely know him, it was the man in front of him who had gone to Pan Long Bay Villa and driven Chen Ping’s parents away!\nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\trespectful\t“Mr. Xing …………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter seeing this youth, Cui Zhiyuan immediately fawned and ran over, before explaining, \nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\trespectful\t“This man is called Chen Ping, he came over to apply for a job, and because he didn’t meet our company’s conditions, we rejected him ……”\nyouth\tmale\tcommanding\t“Keep him ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter the young man said that, he gave Chen Ping another look before turning around and about to leave!\nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tnervous\t“Mr. Xing, he …… is a reformed laborer who just got out of jail ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThat youth slowly turned around, his eyes full of coldness looking at Cui Zhiyuan: \nyouth\tmale\tcold\t“Are you teaching me to do something?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis startled that Cui Zhiyuan and shook his head repeatedly, \nCui Zhiyuan\tmale\tfearful\t“I don’t dare, I don’t dare ……”"
