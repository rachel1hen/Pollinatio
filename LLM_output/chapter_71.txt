"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSir, sit here for a moment, I’ll go ask the manager right away……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing the card in Chen Ping’s hand, the staff’s attitude suddenly changed 180 degrees.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGood! Chen Ping nodded and sat aside to rest while the staff member hurriedly went to ask for the manager!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis made Li Dongmei a little baffled, not understanding why this bank staff member was suddenly so polite to Chen Ping!\nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tsurprised\tChen Ping, do you really have ten million dollars?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing that staff member’s sudden change in attitude, Li Dongmei asked Chen Ping with some confusion.\nChen Ping\tmale\tcold\tWhat business is it of yours?\nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tangry\tChen Ping, let me tell you, it is illegal to forge financial instruments, you are a reformed prisoner, how can you have 10 million, don’t think I don’t know, your family is still living inside the old neighborhood, your father is now sweeping the streets for people, how can you have 10 million……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of how much money you have.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe fact that Chen Ping had just gotten out of jail, there was no way he could have earned $10 million in a few days!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tShe felt that Chen Ping must have said that because he was pretending in front of her on purpose, for her own sake!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe other customers inside the bank, hearing Li Dongmei’s words, also looked at Chen Ping with curiosity, these days it was all about withdrawing money with the card, one would know if there was any money in the card, no one would really be stupid enough to forge a bank card!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNot long after, the bank staff who had just left came over with a middle-aged man wearing glasses and in a bit of a hurry!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHello sir, I am the manager of this bank, how can I help you?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe middle-aged man walked up to Chen Ping and asked politely.\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\tI want to withdraw one million three hundred thousand dollars, but I don’t have an appointment, can I take it out?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping said and handed the card to that bank manager!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe bank manager’s face also changed slightly after seeing the bank card, \nbank manager\tmale\tneutral\tYes, sir, you don’t need to make an appointment, only that we don’t have that much cash right now, I’ll send someone to send the cash over from somewhere else right away, sir, let’s take a break in my office first!\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\tI want to withdraw one million three hundred thousand dollars, but I don’t have an appointment, can I take it out?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping nodded and got up, ready to go to his office and wait!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing this, Li Dongmei was directly dumbfounded and went forward to stop that bank manager and said, \nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tangry\tWhat’s wrong with this bank of yours? Why can you withdraw money without an appointment? He’s just a reformed prisoner, so you didn’t even check if he had any money on his card before you agreed? If so, I want to withdraw a million now too……\nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tangry\tLi Dongmei roared furiously, and then turned to her boyfriend, \nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tangry\tHoney, we want to withdraw a million too……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLi Dongmei’s boyfriend came over, swept a glance at Chen Ping, and then also took out a bank card and handed it to the bank manager: \nLi Dongmei's boyfriend\tmale\tneutral\tI also have 10 million in this card, I want to withdraw a million now too……\nbank manager\tmale\tneutral\tYou can’t withdraw it without an appointment……\nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tangry\tWhat kind of crappy bank are you guys? I want to complain to you, why does he get to withdraw without an appointment and we have to make one? We have $10 million on our card too, can’t you hear?\nbank manager\tmale\tneutral\tThis gentleman is our bank’s supreme VIP, so he doesn’t need to make an appointment, while you are just ordinary customers, there is no comparison……\nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tangry\tHe is your Supreme VIP? Are you mistaken, he is just a reformed prisoner, just released……"
