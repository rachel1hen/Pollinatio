"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSun Fuhai said with a sigh.\nSun Fuhai\tmale\tserious\tOld class leader, I’m not going to lie to you, my company is in a bit of trouble right now. If we don’t get through, I’m afraid we’ll all go bankrupt. Recruiting Chen Ping in is also delaying him.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen Chen Baoguo heard this, he was embarrassed and said,\nChen Baoguo\tmale\tembarrassed\tFuhai, I’ve really caused you trouble. Don’t worry about Chen Ping’s work. What has happened to your company?\nLi Fengxia\tfemale\tmocking\tWhat’s the matter? Can you solve it?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“I……” Chen Baoguo’s face turned red with embarrassment.\nChen Baoguo\tmale\tnervous\tI……\nSun Fuhai\tmale\tangry\tYou shut up!\nSun Fuhai\tmale\tserious\tOld class leader, ignore these women. My company has some business dealings with Fuyao Decoration, and as a result, the payment was withheld by them. And now the capital chain is broken, so I’m afraid I won’t be able to survive much longer!\nSun Fuhai\tmale\tserious\tBut about Chen Ping’s job, I’ll ask Xiaomeng to go to their company and ask them about it. Their company is a group of companies and the benefits are good, so Chen Ping can go in first and start from the bottom!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs soon as Sun Fuhai’s words fell, Sun Xiaomeng immediately said unhappily.\nSun Xiaomeng\tfemale\tangry\tDad, I’m just a salesman. I don’t have any skills. Don’t give me any more trouble……\nSun Fuhai\tmale\tserious\tYou are not capable. Isn’t that Cui Zhiyuan a sales manager? He, a manager, still can’t recruit an employee?\nSun Xiaomeng\tfemale\tnervous\tHe……\nSun Fuhai\tmale\tcommanding\tAlright, it’s settled. If that Cui Zhiyuan doesn’t even have this ability, I don’t think you two are suitable……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWithout waiting for Sun Xiaomeng to be speaking, Sun Fuhai directly threatened Sun Xiaomeng.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs soon as Sun Xiaomeng heard this, she stopped talking and could only be angry and beep.\nLi Fengxia\tfemale\tdissatisfied\tOld Sun, Xiaomeng has made a lot of effort to enter that company. Aren’t you just adding trouble to the child? Besides, they are a big group of companies, can reformed prisoners enter?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping was very uncomfortable when he heard Li Fengxia talk about reformers, but Sun Fuhai was a good person, so Chen Ping couldn’t be angry.\nSun Xiaomeng\tfemale\tangry\tDad, but I put the ugly words in front of me. I am only responsible for bringing in. Whether or not I can get an interview, that depends on my own ability……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSun Xiaomeng rolled her eyes and got up to leave and went back to her bedroom.\nSun Fuhai\tmale\tembarrassed\tOld class leader, this girl has this kind of nature. Don’t take offense……\nChen Baoguo\tmale\tsad\tFuhai, I’ll trouble you. I still have some things to do, so I won’t bother you……\nSun Fuhai\tmale\trespectful\tOld class leader, I’ve booked a hotel. Let’s have a meal together……\nChen Baoguo\tmale\tcalm,No, there is time!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping also helped Tang Hongying to stand up.\nSun Fuhai\tmale\trespectful\tWhen there’s time, I’ll follow the old class leader for a drink alone!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSun Fuhai sent Chen Baoguo’s family out. That Li Fengxia had been sitting on the sofa, not even moving a bit.\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\tUncle Sun, what was the name of the company you said owed you money?\nSun Fuhai\tmale\tneutral\tIt’s called Fuyao Decoration. Does the eldest nephew know anyone in there?\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\tNo, but I’ll try and help Uncle Sun ask for the bill……\nSun Fuhai\tmale\tserious\tEldest nephew, your feelings Uncle Sun appreciate. You are so hard to get out from inside. Breaking the law we can’t do it again. Be filial to your parents. You don’t have to think about my affairs……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSun Fuhai thought that Chen Ping was going to violently demand for money. After all, Chen Ping had just gotten out of jail, so maybe he knew some gangsters or something."
