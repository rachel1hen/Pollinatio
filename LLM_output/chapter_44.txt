"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter entering the hotel, Chen Ping sent a message to Lin Tianhu, asking him to get rid of Xiao Yan.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe did not want to follow the Xiao family’s people to sit and eat together.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBesides, he did not want the Xiao family to know too much about his identity.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe wanted to see how long this Xiao Lei and Geng Shanshan could bounce around.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tInside the hotel!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe crowd gathered around Gu Wentian, each with a respectful face.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOthers knew that Gu Wentian liked to collect antiques, so they searched everywhere and came over to give them to Gu Wentian!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBeside Gu Mantian, a middle-aged man with a sturdy figure and a cold face was always on guard.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis man was Gu Mantian’s personal bodyguard, Tang Long.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOnce retired from the Battle Dragon Squadron, once when Gu Mantian was still in power, he was under close protection.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNow that Gu Mantian had retired, Tang Long had also retired along with him, always protecting Gu Mantian’s safety!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhenever Gu Mantian attended public functions, he would always carry Tang Long around with him to protect himself!\nGu Wentian\tmale\trespectful\t“Gentlemen, I am inviting you all to a banquet today.\nGu Wentian\tmale\trespectful\tFirstly, I am not accepting gifts, and secondly, I am not talking about anything.\nGu Wentian\tmale\trespectful\tI simply want to introduce a new friend to you, so there is no need for you to be too formal!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Wentian waved his hand and told the crowd to be quiet, then said loudly.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIn fact, many people had heard about it long ago, but now that it was coming out of Gu Mantian’s mouth again, the crowd still couldn’t help but be shocked, wondering what kind of terrifying background this person Gu Mantian was introducing would have, or else Gu Mantian wouldn’t have made such a big deal about it!\nGu Wentian\tmale\tserious\t“Why hasn’t Mr. Chen come yet?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Wentian looked at the time and asked Lin Tianhu who was beside him.\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tcalm\t“Probably soon!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu didn’t know how Chen Ping hadn’t arrived yet.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe had said yesterday that he would be fine.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs soon as Lin Tianhu’s words left his mouth, his mobile phone rang.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing that it was a message from Chen Ping, Lin Tianhu gave the message a glance to Gu Wentian.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Wentian looked at the message and nodded slightly, “No wonder Mr. Chen hasn’t shown up yet.\nGu Wentian\tmale\tneutral\tSo that’s what happened.\nGu Wentian\tmale\tneutral\tIt was my poor consideration!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter Gu Mantian finished speaking, he glanced at Xiao Yan who was not far away.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this moment, Xiao Yan was also waiting for this young man that Gu Mantian was talking about to appear.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSomeone who could be so valued by Gu Mantian was definitely not an ordinary person.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIf he could climb up to such a person, the Xiao Clan might be able to surpass the Su Clan!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tXiao Yan was thinking about this when he only saw Gu Wentian look at himself and spoke, \nGu Wentian\tmale\tcommanding\t“Boss Xiao …………”\nXiao Yan\tmale\trespectful\t“Ancient ……,”\nXiao Yan\tmale\trespectful\t“What are Ancient’s orders?”\nGu Wentian\tmale\tcommanding\t“This banquet today is not suitable for you to attend.\nGu Wentian\tmale\tcommanding\tGo back ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Wentian directly gave Xiao Yan an expulsion order in front of the crowd!\nXiao Yan\tmale\tsurprised\t“Gu Gu, I …………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHowever, Gu Man Tian did not wait for Xiao Yan to finish.\nGu Wentian\tmale\tcommanding\t“Send the guest away!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen Xiao Yan saw this, although he was surprised, he could not rely on this place, so he could only turn around and leave helplessly.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this moment, the crowd speculated whether the Xiao family had offended Ancient?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBy now Su Yuqi with Chen Ping had already sneaked in, and the two of them were secretly watching from a corner!\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tcautious\t“Let’s hide first.\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tcautious\tWe’ll go out later when the banquet starts.\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tcautious\tThat way we won’t be easily spotted!”\nChen Ping\tmale\tconfident\t“Why do we need to hide?\nChen Ping\tmale\tconfident\tSince we’ve come in, it’s much better to go out in a big way!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Yuqi was startled and hurriedly went up to pull Chen Ping, but she couldn’t!\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tjoyful\t“Coming!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen Gu Mantian raised his eyes and saw Chen Ping coming, his face was immediately happy and he walked quickly towards Chen Ping!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this moment, Su Wen Zong, who was inside the crowd, saw that Chen Ping had revealed himself and that Gu Man Tian was walking towards Chen Ping, and was immediately shocked out of a cold sweat.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe had asked Su Yuqi to bring in Chen Ping secretly, and now if Gu Wentian found out about it, how could it be?"
