"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tA crisp “clang” rang out as the shield trembled violently but remained intact.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“With such meager skills, you dare to rob travelers?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping snorted coldly, his Dragon-Slaying Sword flashing like a stream of light, piercing the wolf-headed man’s shoulder in an instant.\nnarrator\tunknown\tangry\t“Argh!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe wolf-headed man let out a pained howl, clutching his bleeding shoulder as he staggered back, eyes filled with fear, \nwolf-headed man\tmale\tfearful\t“You… who are you?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Just passing cultivators,” \nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“If you don’t want to die, clear the way!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe wolf-headed man glanced at his groaning subordinates on the ground and the sharp aura emanating from Chen Ping’s sword, realizing he was no match. He quickly fled with his men in a sorry state.\nHu Mazi\tmale\tsurprised\t“These demon cultivators are too weak,”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tas he watched the wolf-headed man’s retreating figure.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“These are just small fry. The real experts are likely inside Black Wind Stronghold.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping sheathed his sword, \nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“Let’s keep moving, but stay cautious.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe two ventured deeper into the misty forest. After about the time it takes to burn an incense stick, the fog began to thin, revealing a massive stronghold ahead.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe stronghold’s walls were built from huge black stones, adorned with black flags bearing a ferocious wolf-head emblem.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt the entrance stood two bear demons, each three zhang tall, wielding giant hammers, their vigilant gazes fixed on passersby.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“This is Black Wind Stronghold,” \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“These two have strength comparable to second-grade Earth Immortal cultivators.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHu Mazi asked.\nHu Mazi\tmale\tcurious\t“How do we get in?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping replied, \nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“We walk right in,” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“We’ll pose as cultivators seeking to join Black Wind Stronghold and gather information.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThey approached the entrance, where the bear demons immediately blocked their path, \nbear demon\tmale\tauthoritative\t“Halt! Who are you, and what’s your business here?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping said, \nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“We’re passing cultivators, hoping to join Black Wind Stronghold. Please inform your leader,” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tslipping a few immortal stones into the bear demon’s hand.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe bear demon weighed the stones, a satisfied smile crossing its face, \nbear demon\tmale\tsatisfied\t“Wait here, I’ll report to the leader.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSoon, the bear demon returned, saying, \nbear demon\tmale\tneutral\t“The leader will see you. Go in.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tFollowing the bear demon, they entered the stronghold, which was livelier than expected. Demon cultivators were everywhere—wolf demons, tiger demons, snake demons, and more, each with a distinct form, exuding thick demonic energy.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt the center stood a massive meeting hall, guarded by two fox demons with long swords. Their appearances were striking, but their eyes were ice-cold.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe bear demon led them to the hall’s entrance, saying, \nbear demon\tmale\tneutral\t“The leader’s inside. Go in yourselves.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tInside, they saw a middle-aged man in a black robe sitting at the center, his face grim and a cold smile on his lips. This was the leader of Black Wind Stronghold, the Black Wind Old Demon.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tFlanking him were a dozen demon cultivators, each with a powerful aura, clearly the stronghold’s core members.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“You’re the cultivators here to join me?” \nBlack Wind Old Demon\tmale\tscrutinizing\t“The leader’s inside. Go in yourselves.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping replied, \nChen Ping\tmale\trespectful\t“Yes, Leader,” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“We’ve heard of Black Wind Stronghold’s might and wish to serve you.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Oh? What skills do you have?” \nBlack Wind Old Demon\tmale\tinquiring\t“You two think you’re fit to serve me? Black Wind Stronghold doesn’t take in trash!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping said, \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“We know some basic spells and can fight for you,”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Hahaha…” \nBlack Wind Old Demon\tmale\tamused\t“You two think you’re fit to serve me? Black Wind Stronghold doesn’t take in trash!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping suggested, \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“If you doubt us, Leader, test our skills,”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Fine! I’ll give you a chance,” \nBlack Wind Old Demon\tmale\tauthoritative\t“We’ve got a grudge with Green Snake Valley to the east. Kill their valley master, bring me his head, and I’ll accept you.”"
