"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Chen Ping?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this time, in the middle of the front of the line, a woman dressed in a fashionable and somewhat sultry outfit shouted out towards Chen Ping.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe woman was also wearing a large sunglasses that covered half of her face!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“You are?” \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“You are?” Chen Ping frowned slightly and shot a glance at the woman!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIt’s \nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tneutral\t“… me, Li Dongmei ……” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe woman took off her sunglasses!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping was suddenly enlightened, \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“So it’s you, I didn’t even recognize you ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLi Dongmei was Chen Ping’s classmate in middle school, and the two of them were still at the same table, back then that Li Dongmei was very sloppy, but not as fashionable as now!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLi Dongmei shot a glance at Chen Ping, and then with a few sneers in her eyes \nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tsneering\tshe said, “I heard you were in jail, when did you get out?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tTo bring up the matter of imprisonment directly in such a public place was clearly an attempt to make a fool of Chen Ping!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBack then when the two were at the same table, this Li Dongmei had even written love letters to Chen Ping, after all, at that time Chen Ping’s father was in politics and his family was also well off, many girls liked Chen Ping!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOnly Chen Ping didn’t pay much attention to this Li Dongmei at all, because at that time Li Dongmei was not outstanding at all!\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“Just got out a few days ago ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping smiled lightly and answered truthfully!\nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tsarcastic\t“Just got out, and you’ve come to get over a million dollars? You’re really rich …………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping also just laughed and did not answer, but pulled away from the topic and asked, \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“When did you come to Hongcheng, I heard that you stopped going to school after graduating from junior high school?”\nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tproud\t“Yes, I stopped going to school after graduating from junior high school, but I am now much better than you, a university graduate ……” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLi Dongmei said, pointing to a fat-headed middle-aged man sitting on a chair next to her and said, \nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tproud\t“That’s My boyfriend, the boss of a company, assets of tens of millions, today I came to do a card, from now on the money is under my control!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLi Dongmei had a smug look on her face, although the middle-aged man looked older than her father, she herself didn’t feel anything wrong, as long as the other party had money!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping looked at the obese middle-aged man and only smiled slightly, \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“Then congratulations, you’ve found a rich boyfriend ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAlthough Chen Ping only smiled slightly, but Li Dongmei felt a pang of disgust in her heart, she felt that Chen Ping was laughing at herself!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Sir, withdrawing money over half a million is something that needs to be booked in advance, have you made an appointment?”\nbank staff\tunknown\tneutral\tThe bank staff’s tone became a little tougher after knowing that Chen Ping was a recently released labour prisoner!\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“I have an urgent need, so I don’t have an appointment, can you make an accommodation?”\nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tsneering\t“Chen Ping, what are you doing with over a million dollars in a hurry? Looking at you, you don’t look like you have a million either, you’re not coming over to pretend, are you?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping ignored her, but took out his card and handed it to the bank staff, \nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“I have ten million in this card, I only want to withdraw one million three hundred thousand now, can you be a little more accommodating?”\nLi Dongmei\tfemale\tdisbelieving\t“Ten million? Are you kidding me, do you have ten million dollars? You’re just a labour prisoner who just got out of prison, how could you possibly have that much money.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLi Dongmei sneered, looking at Chen Ping with a disdainful expression!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAnd that bank staff was also a little impatient and said with a cold face, \nbank staff\tunknown\tneutral\t“Even if you have 20 million, this is the bank’s rule, you can’t ……”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut before he could finish his words, the bank staff suddenly saw the card in Chen Ping’s hand, and his whole body just froze, followed by his eyes opening roundly!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBecause the bank card was given to Chen Ping by Su Wenzong, and Su Wenzong being the richest man in Hongcheng, his cards all had very obvious special marks, the bank staff could see at a glance that it was the Su family’s bank card, and Chen Ping could hold the Su family’s bank card, so he would certainly not be an ordinary person."
