"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Master Tiger, don’t beat him to death at once, but torture him to death …………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen he saw Lin Tianhu coming, Xiao Lei immediately screamed.\nXiao Lei\tmale\tangry\t“You are teaching me to do something?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu frowned and looked at that Xiao Lei!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWith just this glance, it scared that Xiao Lei almost didn’t wet his trousers and backed up, \nXiao Lei\tmale\tfearful\t“I dare not dare ……”\nXiao Yan\tmale\tangry\t“b*****d, how dare you talk to Master Tiger like that!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tXiao Yan stepped forward and gave Xiao Lei a fierce slap before saying with a face full of smiles, \nXiao Yan\tmale\tapologetic\t“Master Tiger, my dog’s son is ignorant, I hope Master Tiger will not be offended!”\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tcold\t“Xiao Yan, let me tell you, I, Lin Tianhu, do owe your Xiao family a favour, but I am not an underling of your Xiao family, I hope you understand!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu said in a cold voice!\nXiao Yan\tmale\tfearful\t“Understand, understand, Master Tiger is a guest of my Xiao family, how can he be an inferior!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tXiao Yan was frightened to the point of cold sweat and glared fiercely at his own son!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThat Xiao Lei, who was originally in pain from his broken arm, had just had his arm slapped by Xiao Yan and was now lowering his head, not daring to say a word!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing that Xiao Yan’s attitude was still okay, Lin Tianhu put his gaze back on Chen Ping!\nSu Wenzong\tmale\texplanatory\t“Master Tiger, Mr. Chen was also impulsive, that bride was Mr. Chen’s girlfriend, but she was snatched away by this Xiao Lei, all Mr. Chen has some resentment!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Wenzong hurriedly stepped forward and followed Lin Tianhu with a face full of smiles as he explained!\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tunderstanding\t“Oh!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu nodded, finally understanding that this guy, who looked like no more than an ordinary guy, dared to make trouble at the Xiao family wedding, so it was because his girlfriend had been snatched.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut soon, Lin Tianhu reacted and suddenly froze and said to Su Wenzong, \nLin Tianhu\tmale\tinquiring\t“What did you call him?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Wenzong was the richest man in Hongcheng, how could he possibly address an ordinary young man in his early twenties as sir, there must be a reason for this!\nSu Wenzong\tmale\texplanatory\t“Mr. Chen!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Wenzong was bewildered, but he quickly understood Lin Tianhu’s meaning and explained, \nSu Wenzong\tmale\texplanatory\t“Mr. Chen saved my life, so no matter what, I have to protect him today!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOnly then did Lin Tianhu completely understand what was going on, to put it mildly it wasn’t a big deal, but with the Su family and the Xiao family going toe to toe, this was a big deal, that’s why the Xiao family had brought themselves here!\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tauthoritative\t“It’s such a small matter, look what your two families have become! Since that boy caused trouble at the wedding and beat up the Xiao family’s boy, you can’t let him off lightly, but he’s not guilty to death, so let him break his arm and apologise in public, admit his mistake and get lost!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu reprimanded both Su Wenzong and Xiao Yan, but neither of them dared to retort!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe was able to become the underground emperor of Hong City, Lin Tianhu did not only rely on his fists, but also on his mind.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIn this way, the Xiao family would have face and the Su family would not be offended, for Lin Tianhu, it would be the best of both worlds!\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tinquiring\t“Do you two think what I said is okay?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu saw that Su Wenzong and Xiao Yan were silent, so he asked again.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe did not ask Chen Ping, the party in question, because in his eyes, Chen Ping was a pawn and he would have to move however he was told to move.\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tsubmissive\t“All listen to Master Tiger!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWho dared to refute Su Wenzong and Xiao Yan?\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tamused\t“Isn’t that the end of it, why make a big deal out of it as if it was so serious!” \nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu chuckled before he looked at Chen Ping and said, \nLin Tianhu\tmale\tauthoritative\t“Kid, you made a scene at someone’s wedding and beat up their son, now break your own arm and apologise to them and you will be let go, otherwise you would not have been able to leave today!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping looked at Xiao Lei who was full of smugness, he was waiting for Chen Ping to break his own arm and then go over and apologize to him.\nChen Ping\tmale\tindifferent\t“They don’t deserve …………”"
