There’s nothing good here, it’s all ground-floor goods, the really good stuff is still inside!”\nLin Tianhu\tmale\trespectful\t“Mr. Chen, I don’t know if you like any objects? There’s nothing good here, it’s all ground-floor goods, the really good stuff is still inside!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu said to Chen Ping.\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“I want to buy a spirit pen and vermilion, I don’t know if there is one here!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping asked to Lin Tianhu.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu was stunned, not understanding what the spirit pen Chen Ping was talking about, and the vermilion sand, wasn’t it also everywhere?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut Lin Tianhu did not dare to ask, he could only say respectfully, \nLin Tianhu\tmale\trespectful\t“Mr. Chen, I will take you to a few antique walks, you can see if there is something you want, I don’t know much about this business either!”\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“Alright, lead the way ahead!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping nodded his head!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu personally led the way, and the owners of those antique shops brought out all their treasures, but none of them caught Chen Ping’s eye.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis time, Lin Tianhu was in a bit of a quandary: \nLin Tianhu\tmale\tneutral\t“Mr. Chen, the antique street is just this big, all the chances of good things are here, surprisingly there is still nothing that Mr. Chen needs, why don’t I send my brothers to look for it elsewhere?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tcalm\t“No need, this kind of thing, can be found but not sought, even if you guys come across it, it’s useless even if you don’t know what you’re doing!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping waved his hand, even if he asked more people to look for it, it would be useless!\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tneutral\t“That’s true!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu nodded his head!\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“You go and get busy, I should go back too!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSince there was none, Chen Ping didn’t want to stay any longer!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut just as Chen Ping was about to leave, Lin Tianhu seemed to remember something and immediately called out to Chen Ping, \nLin Tianhu\tmale\tneutral\t“Mr. Chen, wait!”\nChen Ping\tmale\tneutral\t“Something else?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping asked.\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tneutral\t“Mr. Chen, I suddenly remembered a place that might have what you need.”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu finished, ordered someone to bring the car and invited Chen Ping into it!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIn the car, Lin Tianhu then introduced himself, it turned out that the place he was taking Chen Ping to was a mansion, and the owner of the mansion was called Gu Wentian, who used to be a retired senior officer of the provincial government!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter he retired, he built a mansion in a beautiful place in Hongcheng, and then spent his time there.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut this Gu Mantian had a hobby, that is, collecting antiques. In Gu Mantian’s courtyard, there were antiques everywhere, some of which were plucked from abroad.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping did not expect that there would be such a big man in the small city of Hong Kong. If it wasn’t for the three years of learning from the old leader, the ordinary Chen Ping would not have been able to come into contact with these big men.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSoon, the car stopped at an ancient mansion, and a subordinate hurried over, followed Lin Tianhu and whispered two words, and ran back to the mansion!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSoon, an old man with a white beard and a walking stick came out, after seeing Lin Tianhu, the old man laughed and said, \nGu Wentian\tmale\tjoyful\t“It’s a rare guest to have Master Tiger here!”\nLin Tianhu\tmale\trespectful\t“Ancient, you are flattering me, just call me Little Tiger, or Lin Tianhu, in front of you, how dare I call myself Master!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLin Tianhu hurriedly took two steps forward to welcome him and said with a face full of courtesy.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAlthough he had retired, his energy was not small, so Lin Tianhu did not dare to offend him!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter following Lin Tianhu and exchanging a few pleasantries, Gu Mantian saw Chen Ping at the side and asked after a quick glance, \nGu Wentian\tmale\tcurious\t“Master Tiger, this young man is a bit familiar, is …………”\nLin Tianhu\tmale\trespectful\t“Oh, this is Mr. Chen, this time bring Mr. Chen specially to disturb ancient, also hope ancient do not take offense!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHearing Lin Tianhu address Chen Ping, who was only in his early twenties, as sir, a hint of surprise flashed across Gu Wentian’s eyes, but it was only a flash!"
