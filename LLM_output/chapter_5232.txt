"narrator\tfemale\tneutral_At this moment, inside the grand hall of the Black Fiend Demon Palace, the Nether Moon Witch (Youyue) was anxiously awaiting news.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_She had dispatched multiple groups to search for Chen Ping’s whereabouts, but there was still no result.\nNether Moon Witch (Youyue)\tfemale\tangry\t“So many people, and you can’t even find two individuals, what use are you to me?”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_After Nether Moon and her group entered the Fifth Heaven, they discovered that with their strength, surviving in the Fifth Heaven was impossible, especially since Nether Moon was nearly killed, so they hurriedly returned to the Fourth Heaven!\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_They assumed that with Chen Ping and Hu Mazi’s strength, they couldn’t survive in the Fifth Heaven either and would surely use a spatial rift to return to the Fourth Heaven!\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_Thus, they sent people to search everywhere for traces of Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, but there was still no news.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_At that moment, a guard rushed in frantically, \nguard\tmale\turgent\t“Reporting to the Witch, Chen Ping and Hu Mazi are attacking with another person!”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_“What?” \nNether Moon Witch (Youyue)\tfemale\tsurprised\t“I’m looking for them, and they dare to show up at my doorstep?”\nNether Moon Witch (Youyue)\tfemale\tdetermined\t“Pass my order, all disciples assemble immediately and follow me to confront them!”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_At that moment, three figures descended from the sky, landing in front of the Black Fiend Demon Palace disciples.\nChen Ping\tmale\tcold\t“Nether Moon Witch, I trust you’ve been well?”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_The Nether Moon Witch (Youyue) sneered at Chen Ping, \nNether Moon Witch (Youyue)\tfemale\tsneering\t“Chen Ping, you’ve got some nerve! You dare come to us, thinking you can take on our Black Fiend Demon Palace just because you’ve brought a tall helper?”\nHu Mazi\tmale\tscoffing\t“Nether Moon Witch (Youyue), enough nonsense. We’re here today to seek justice. If you’re smart, you’ll surrender quietly, entertain me for a few nights, make me comfortable, and I might spare your life!”\nNether Moon Witch (Youyue)\tfemale\tangry\t“Looking for death!”\nNether Moon Witch (Youyue)\tfemale\tangry\t“Attack! Kill them, and you’ll be richly rewarded!”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_The disciples of the Black Fiend Demon Palace surged towards Chen Ping and the others like a tidal wave.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_Nan Batian laughed loudly, stepping forward to meet them, his aura exploding instantly!\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_The overwhelming pressure forced all the Black Fiend Demon Palace disciples to the ground, unable to move!\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_Even Nether Moon felt her body sink, as if crushed by a mountain, unable to stand upright!\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_Nether Moon stared at Nan Batian in shock, unable to discern his realm or strength.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_Chen Ping, having spoken, drew his Dragon-Slaying Sword and charged at the Nether Moon Witch (Youyue), his full power at the seventh rank of the Loose Immortal Realm bursting forth, golden sword energy sweeping invincibly.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_The Nether Moon Witch (Youyue), looking at the Black Fiend Demon Palace disciples sprawled on the ground, grew increasingly anxious, knowing she might fall here today.\nNether Moon Witch (Youyue)\tfemale\tdetermined\t“Chen Ping, today I’ll test your skills!”\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_The Nether Moon Witch (Youyue)’s strength was indeed formidable, having reached the fourth rank of the Earth Immortal Realm, an improvement from before.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_But with the aid of the Pure World Blue Lotus, Chen Ping had not only broken through to the seventh rank of the Loose Immortal Realm but also gained richer combat experience.\nnarrator\tfemale\tneutral_For a moment, the two fought evenly matched."
