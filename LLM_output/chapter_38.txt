"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen Chen Ping returned home, his parents were not at home, so they had gone out for a walk again.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThere was no one to disturb him, so Chen Ping cultivated in his room!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe had to make the most of his time now, because he didn’t know what he would face on the 15th day of the 7th month. Although the old leader said that he would be given a great opportunity on that day, who knew if the opportunity would be accompanied by danger?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSitting on his knees, Chen Ping recited the Heart Concentration Technique, and his dantian began to slowly rotate, the surrounding spiritual qi was slowly absorbed by Chen Ping and entered his body!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping didn’t even eat dinner, he cultivated for another whole night!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Hoo……”\nChen Ping\tmale\tjoyful\t“I really didn’t expect this resentful dragon power to be so powerful…………”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping gently clenched his fist, feeling the thick power within his body, Chen Ping had actually broken through!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tNow Chen Ping had already reached the fifth level of Qi training, one should know that he had only broken through to the fourth level of Qi training after three years in prison and the guidance of the old dragon leader, but he had never expected to break through to the fifth level in one go after absorbing the power of the nine grievous dragons yesterday, which made Chen Ping overjoyed!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping seemed to have found a way to cultivate quickly, as long as he absorbed more resentment, the power of hatred, then the speed of cultivation would increase exponentially!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIt was a pity that such things could not be found, where could one find so many things with resentment and hatred attached to them!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tExhaling lightly, Chen Ping got off the bed and simply straightened his clothes!\nTang Hongying\tfemale\tneutral\t“It’s Miss Su, isn’t it? I can’t see, but I can hear you walking!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tspeaks.\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tcalm\t“Auntie, you’re really something!” \nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tcalm\t“You don’t have to keep calling me Miss, Miss, it’s too much, just call me Yuqi!”\nTang Hongying\tfemale\trespectful\t“Yes, yes, it’s uncomfortable, I’ll call you Yu Qi then!”\nTang Hongying\tfemale\tneutral\t“You’re here to see Chen Ping, right?

I really want to see what this future daughter-in-law of mine looks like!”\nChen Baoguo\tmale\trespectful\t“Wife, let me tell you, Miss Su’s looks, I’m afraid there’s nothing as pretty as this in the whole of Hongcheng!”\nTang Hongying\tfemale\tsurprised\t“Is that so?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tTang Hongying was a little surprised, she knew that Chen Baoguo had a very picky eye, back then when Chen Ping and Geng Shanshan were together, Chen Baoguo was firmly against it, now that Chen Baoguo could say that, then Su Yuqi’s looks must be unbeatable.\nTang Hongying\tfemale\tproud\t“My son is so capable, he just came out and found such a girlfriend, and he even hid it from us!”\nChen Baoguo\tmale\tsatisfied\t“That’s for sure, don’t even look at who our son follows, with me in front again, our son can’t be any worse!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Baoguo was also very satisfied with Chen Ping at this time, his previously gloomy face was now covered with smiles all day long!\nTang Hongying\tfemale\tjoyful\t“All right, don’t blow it off, take me out for a spin, leave the two kids a world of their own!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tTang Hongying said, pulling Chen Baoguo out of the villa!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tOn the other hand, Su Yuqi pushed the door and walked into Chen Ping’s bedroom!\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tsurprised\t“Aren’t you up already?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tteasing\t“What, you don’t want me to get up and want to see me with my clothes off?”\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tamused\t“Yuck, who wants to see you undress!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Yuqi gave Chen Ping a blank look, but inside she was still a little excited, the fact that Chen Ping could joke with her proved that the relationship between the two had obviously improved a lot.\nSu Yuqi\tfemale\tcommanding\t“I’m looking for you for something, you come with me!”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Yuqi pulled Chen Ping along without a word and left!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping wanted to ask where he was going, but Su Yuqi pulled Chen Ping straight into the car!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut looking at the time, it was still early for the banquet that Gu Mantian had invited him to, so Chen Ping let Su Yuqi pull him along."
