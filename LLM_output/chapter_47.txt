"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tUh …………\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing Chen Ping shake his head no so quickly, Su Wenzong froze for a moment, but quickly smiled slightly and said,\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tneutral\tThat’s fine, this girl Yu Qi may not be a girl, but she is still very good at running a company and doing business, so it’s fine with her!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter Su Wenzong said that, he left!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tChen Ping looked at Su Wenzong’s back and smiled helplessly, he could understand what Su Wenzong was thinking!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter all, he only had one daughter, Su Yuqi, and in the future, the family business would be handed over to Su Yuqi, if he followed Su Yuqi, there would always be someone to support the family business, but Chen Ping really didn’t like business!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSoon, everyone was ready to leave and say goodbye to each other!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut at that moment, the door of the banquet was suddenly pushed open, and dozens of people burst in, all armed with weapons, the leader of which had a fierce face and a vague aura, a master at first glance!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing these people suddenly barge in, everyone present was shocked, and that Gu Mantian’s face was cold, and his bodyguard Tang Long directly drew a half-foot long machete from his waist to protect Gu Mantian’s body!\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tangry\tSecurity, where’s the security?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSu Wenzong saw someone rushing in and shouted loudly, but not a single security guard came in!\nFeng Sihai\tmale\tcold\tMr Su, no need to shout, none of your security guards can get in!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe visitor said coldly.\nSu Wenzong\tmale\tangry\tFeng Sihai, what are you trying to do by suddenly barging in with people, you know this is a banquet prepared by ancient times!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIt turned out that these people were all members of the Red Dragon Gang, and this leader was the gang leader Feng Sihai!\nFeng Sihai\tmale\trespectful\tAncient, I have no intention to disturb, I just came to find Lin Tianhu!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt this moment, Lin Tianhu had already clenched his fists, from the moment Feng Sihai entered the door, he knew he was here to find him!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe Juyi Hall and the Red Dragon Gang were sworn enemies, and the two were also deadly rivals, only that neither could do anything to the other for the time being.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tUsually when Lin Tianhu attended a party, he would bring many of his men with him, but this time with the Gu Wentian situation, Lin Tianhu was a bit careless and didn’t bring his men, and another reason was that there was Chen Ping around, so Lin Tianhu was at ease!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis Feng Sihai must have gotten the news and this is why he brought his men over, as long as he killed Lin Tianhu, the Gathering Hall would have no head and would soon be swallowed up by the Red Dragon Gang.\nGu Wentian\tmale\tangry\tI don’t care who you are looking for, but is my banquet also something you can just barge into?\nFeng Sihai\tmale\trespectful\tAncient, as I said, I was only looking for Lin Tianhu to settle a score, and I had no choice but to barge in!\nGu Wentian\tmale\tangry\tb*****d!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tGu Wentian slammed the table,\nGu Wentian\tmale\tangry\tAre you trying to go against me now?\nFeng Sihai\tmale\tneutral\tAncient, I don’t want to go against you, but I don’t want to let Lin Tianhu go either, this kind of opportunity is once in a lifetime, besides Ancient, for such an important banquet, only Lin Tianhu was invited, but not me, Feng Sihai, this is obviously not looking down on my Red Dragon Gang?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tFeng Sihai said without being condescending, obviously upset that Gu Wentian had not invited him!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe reason why Gu Mantian didn’t invite Feng Sihai at that time was because the feud between him and Lin Tianhu was too deep and it was not convenient for him to come!\nGu Wentian\tmale\tangry\tFeng Sihai, are you …………\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen Gu Wentian saw that this Feng Sihai was not giving face, he was furious and his face turned red.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut before he could finish his sentence, that Lin Tianhu stood out,\nLin Tianhu\tmale\tneutral\tA great man is a man of honor, since you are coming at me, then let’s compete!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter Lin Tianhu finished speaking, he directly set up his stance, ready to deal with Feng Sihai’s attack!\nFeng Sihai\tmale\taggressive\tYou have guts, then today I will get you killed, before taking your Gathering Hall into my pocket!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tFeng Sihai said, charging towards Lin Tianhu with big steps."
