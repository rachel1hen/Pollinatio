You have some nerve, causing trouble in my Black Fiend Demon Palace. Who are you? Do you have a master backing you?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tIn You Wuji’s view, for Chen Ping to dare cause trouble in their palace, he must have a master or a force supporting him, otherwise he wouldn’t dare!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAt that moment, Chen Ping, Nan Batian, and Hu Mazi rushed in.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSeeing You Wuji, Chen Ping sneered coldly.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis guy was only at the fifth rank of the Earth Immortal Realm, a far cry from Nan Batian’s peak seventh rank; there was no need to fear him!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLooking at the black-robed old man before him, Chen Ping’s lips curled into a mocking arc, the Demon-Whipping Lash in his hand still trembling slightly, carrying the lingering aura of demonic energy.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Fifth rank of the Earth Immortal Realm?”\nChen Ping\tmale\tangry\t“Fifth rank of the Earth Immortal Realm?”\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tHe scoffed, his eyes filled with undisguised contempt, “I thought the Black Fiend Demon Palace was hiding some earth-shattering figure, but it’s just an old fool cowering behind his daughter.\nChen Ping\tmale\tangry\t“I thought the Black Fiend Demon Palace was hiding some earth-shattering figure, but it’s just an old fool cowering behind his daughter.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWhen your daughter was crying for help earlier, why didn’t you show up?
