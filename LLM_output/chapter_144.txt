"narrator\tunknown\tneutral\tLeng Bing looked at that expression of the crowd, the corner of his mouth slightly raised: \nLeng Bing\tmale\tconfident\tAlthough this meal today doesn’t cost much, but I know that many of you are not rich in your hands now, all you have to do now is to call me Brother Bing and toast me, and I will pay for you……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter Leng Bing finished speaking, his gaze looked towards Wang Han Han and Chen Ping both, it was obvious that this offer from Leng Bing was aimed at them both!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\t“Brother Bing is mighty, I’ll toast you first……”\nunknown\tmale\tjoyful\tBrother Bing is mighty, I’ll toast you first……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAs soon as the words fell, someone immediately lifted a glass of wine to toast Leng Bing!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tSoon, all of them were full of flattery and gave a toast to Leng Bing, and in the end, only Wang Han Han, Chen Ping and Wu Yi Fan were left!\nWang Yutian\tmale\tneutral\tYi Fan, aren’t you going to give a toast to Brother Bing?\nWu Yi Fan\tfemale\tcalm\tEighteen thousand dollars, I still have it…………\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWu Yi Fan’s meaning was obvious, she would rather pay this share of money herself than give a toast to Leng Bing!\nWang Yutian\tmale\tangry\tWhat kind of big money are you pretending to be? How many times do you have to be slept with to earn this eighteen thousand yuan? For your own good, you still don’t appreciate it……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe company’s main business is to provide a wide range of products and services to the public.\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThis sentence, like a bolt from the blue, immediately exploded, everyone looked at Wu Yi Fan!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAnd Wu Yifan’s face was blue, feeling the gazes of the crowd, even the feeling of drilling into a rat hole!\nWu Yi Fan\tfemale\tangry\tWang Yutian, what the f*ck are you talking about, believe it or not I’ll get you killed…………\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWu Yifan stood up with a scuffle, still carrying a bottle in her hand!\nWang Yutian\tmale\tdefensive\tWu Yifan, your mouth is clean, who is talking nonsense, what do you do yourself, you do not know yourself?\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tWu Yifan was trembling with anger as she held the bottle in her hand and was about to throw it at Wang Yutian!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tShe regretted it now, she treated Wang Yutian as her sister, but she betrayed her!\nZhang Miao\tfemale\tcommanding\tWhat are you two doing? I’m the one who organised this reunion today, are you two not giving me face by making such a scene? If that’s the case, you two get the hell out of here……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tZhang Miao herself relied on the fact that Leng Bing was her boyfriend, so she made herself the dominant one!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut after such a yell, Wang Yutian didn’t dare to speak anymore, and Wu Yifan sat back with tears in her angry eyes!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tBut the crowd looked at Wu Yifan with a bit of fire in their eyes, especially the male students, after all, Wu Yifan was quite good looking, and now they might be able to sleep with Wu Yifan for just a few hundred dollars for one night!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tAfter this incident, Wu Yi Fan kept her head down and didn’t say a word.\nZhang Miao\tfemale\tcalm\tCome on, let’s all eat together, usually you can’t eat something this good……\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe crowd began to eat lively, no one bothered about Wu Yifan, only Wang Hanhan kept comforting Wu Yifan, but Wu Yifan still didn’t say a word!\nnarrator\tunknown\tneutral\tThe crowd pushed and exchanged glasses, while Chen Ping just ate by himself, no one paid any attention to him, and he didn’t pay any attention to anyone either!\nLeng Bing\tmale\tmocking\tBrother Chen Ping, why are you only eating the food and not drinking?
