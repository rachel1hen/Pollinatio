After who knows how long, Chen Ping arrived above a silent ocean, the sea dead still, rivaling the eerie calm of the Eastern Domain’s Dead Sea!
Looking ahead, a grey haze loomed, like a barrier marking the edge of the Celestial Human Realm!
“Cross this, and it should be the Lawless Land…”
Chen Ping took a deep breath, then flew toward the murky grey zone!
Behind him, Xuan Bin and the crew piloted the airship!
But just as Chen Ping reached the grey area, a mysterious force suddenly pressed down on him!
He didn’t flinch, smashing through the pressure with his tough-as-nails body!
At that moment, an old man stepped out from the grey zone.
A peak Mahayana Realm cultivator!
Dressed in a black robe, the old man sized up Chen Ping’s realm, his face dripping with disdain!
“When did a Third-Grade Mahayana Realm scrub start showing up here?”
The old man sneered at Chen Ping!
Chen Ping gave him a couple of glances, not bothering to engage, aiming to slip past!
But the old man stretched out a hand, “Don’t you know the rules?”
“What rules?”
Chen Ping paused, puzzled!
“To enter the Lawless Land, it’s a thousand immortal spirit stones!” the old man said!
Chen Ping didn’t reply, just tossed a thousand immortal spirit stones his way!
A thousand stones to Chen Ping, pocket change!
No point wasting time over it!
The old man blinked at the stones, caught off guard, clearly not expecting a Third-Grade Mahayana Realm kid to casually chuck out a thousand immortal spirit stones like it was nothing!
“Got a rich kid here…” the old man thought, gleeful inside!
“Can I go now?”
Chen Ping asked!
“You can pass, sure, but once you’re in the Lawless Land, we…”
The old man started, but before he could finish, Chen Ping lobbed another thousand immortal spirit stones into his hands!
This nouveau riche vibe left the old man gobsmacked!
“Anything else?” Chen Ping asked!
“Uh…” The old man scrambled for another excuse, Chen Ping was a prime mark, and he didn’t want to let this fat sheep slip away!
Low-realm, loaded cultivators like Chen Ping were rare as hen’s teeth, a juicy target you’d fleece to the bone!
Usually, these rich second-gen types rolled with heavy-hitting escorts, barely glancing at gatekeepers like him!
Now, Chen Ping stood alone, if not now, when to fleece him?
“Of course, this cash gets you into the Lawless Land, but inside, there’s sanitation fees, head taxes, road tolls, bridge fees…”
The old man ticked off on his fingers, laying it out for Chen Ping!
“Just tell me how many immortal spirit stones total!” Chen Ping cut in, fed up with the spiel!
“It’s… it’s…” The old man calculated, then grit his teeth, “Five thousand immortal spirit stones…”
“Here…”
Before the words fully left his mouth, Chen Ping flung five thousand immortal spirit stones at him.
The old man froze, then slapped himself hard, “Bloody hell, I lowballed it…”
How’d he muck this up?
Gritting his teeth, he’d only dared ask for five thousand!
If he’d gone higher, this guy’d clearly pay up…
Sigh…
The regret stung!
“Hang on a sec, your case is a bit special, needs our elder to come check it out!”
The old man blocked Chen Ping!
“You’re from the Huo family?” Chen Ping asked!
“Yep,” the old man nodded, “But don’t bother name-dropping Huo family connections, won’t work, rules are rules, no back doors!”
“Don’t worry, I won’t, though I do know your Huo family’s Huo Ming and Huo Qing, the young masters!” Chen Ping smirked faintly!
