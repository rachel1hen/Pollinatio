He clearly intended to wear Mu Sha down to death!
As a Heavenly Realm cultivator, Mu Sha couldn’t recover at all in this Celestial Realm!
Countless fist shadows hurtled toward Mu Sha, who gazed coldly at the terrifying barrage before him.
Suddenly, he opened his palm, then clenched it tight!
Boom!
In Mu Sha’s palm, strange runes began to appear!
The moment those runes flowed from his hand, the sky above the Land of No Return erupted with thousands of resounding tones.
The runes, as if alive, coiled around his fist, briefly halting the distorted space and time around them.
Wen Nanxing’s pupils shrank, he sensed the aura of heavenly punishment in that fist’s wind, a pressure of the Heavenly Dao that only a true immortal could summon!
“Heavenly Dao Fist!”
Mu Sha’s gaunt frame suddenly swelled to ten feet tall, and where his fist passed, the void cracked with web-like fissures.
Wen Nanxing crossed his arms before his chest, crimson-gold flames flaring around him, yet the moment the fist wind struck, a sharp metallic clang rang out.
Where their fists clashed, the spiritual energy within a hundred-yard radius solidified instantly, crumbling into dust that drifted down.
“Crack!”
The sound of Wen Nanxing’s right arm breaking was unmistakable, he stumbled back seven steps, each one leaving a charred footprint in the void.
Mu Sha pressed his advantage, his left hand forming a seal, and nine bolts of lightning suddenly descended from the sky, transforming into chains that bound Wen Nanxing’s limbs.
“Thunder Prison Calamity!” Mu Sha’s white beard fluttered, blood tears streaming from his left eye, “Today, with just a third of my power, I’ll slay you, false immortal!”
Wen Nanxing let out a sky-shaking roar, and the Fire Incineration Sect’s totem emerged from the void behind him, a shadowy black sparrow reborn in flames.
The sparrow’s wings spread wide, blotting out the sun, each feather ablaze with eerie blue netherfire that melted the thunder chains entirely.
Mu Sha grunted, blood frothing at his mouth, the runes around him flickering unsteadily.
“Hmph, the Heavenly Dao of the Celestial Realm doesn’t recognise your immortal laws!”
Wen Nanxing grinned ferociously, ripping open his chest and crushing his own heart, a torrent of blood energy roaring forth as a blood dragon, “Heaven Incineration Technique!”
Mu Sha’s thunder calamity melted like snow under a blazing sun before the blood dragon.
He staggered, watching the blood dragon charge with world-ending might, and as it pierced his chest, the last dormant shred of immortal power within him finally erupted.
That sliver of immortal energy transformed into a three-foot azure blade, bursting from Mu Sha’s back and cleaving the blood dragon in two!
Wen Nanxing stared blankly at his empty chest cavity, where half a blood-stained sword tip now protruded.
“This… is the Sword Intent of Heavenly Punishment?”
Golden blood suddenly poured from Wen Nanxing’s seven orifices, he frantically channelled his spiritual energy to repair his body, only to find the sword intent at the wound devouring his vitality, “Impossible! You’re clearly down to…”
Mu Sha swayed and collapsed, the sword intent fading from his back to reveal stark white bone.
The world fell abruptly silent.
Wen Nanxing stood unsteadily, the sword wound on his chest healing at a visible rate.
He looked down at the crimson-gold flames rekindling in his palm, then burst into maniacal laughter, “So you were already at your limit! Today, I’ll extract your immortal bones and refine them into a treasure!”
Mu Sha’s breathing had faded to nearly nothing, while Li Chunfeng and the others fought desperately to block the aftershocks.
Against Wen Nanxing, at the peak of the Immortal Transformation Realm, all resistance was futile, even if Lin Chong and the others teamed up, it was useless!
Boom!
Suddenly, the heavens and earth trembled, and within the Heaven and Earth Array, a golden light enveloped Chen Ping!
Chen Ping’s eyes snapped open, a steely resolve shining within them!
“So the key to this Heaven and Earth Array was right here…”
With that, Chen Ping drew his Dragon-Slaying Sword, his body shooting forward!
In an instant, his figure vanished, disappearing completely into the Heaven and Earth Array!
But in the next moment, amid a rumbling roar, the Heaven and Earth Array began to collapse at a visible pace!
Chen Ping reappeared, gazing at the crumbling array with a faint smile on his lips!
