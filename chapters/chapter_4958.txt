Dozens of secret agents from Flying Tiger City donned the armour of the Battle Soldier Team, then marched neatly towards the City Lord’s Mansion.
Due to Rhino City’s intensified patrols, the streets were filled with Battle Soldier Teams, so no one suspected the identity of this particular group.
Upon reaching the entrance of the City Lord’s Mansion, the group was stopped.
“Show your token,” a guard said to the leader.
The leader, who was none other than the shopkeeper of Tianbao Pavilion, promptly produced a token and handed it over.
The guard examined the token, and with a flash of white light, it was confirmed to be genuine, not a forgery.
Seeing the token was authentic, the guard returned it, “Go in.”
Soon, the shopkeeper of Tianbao Pavilion led his group into the City Lord’s Mansion.
Once inside, the shopkeeper whispered, “Now split into two groups, avoid conflict if possible, and search for the residences of the City Lord’s son and daughter.”
Everyone nodded, then divided into two teams to begin searching for Niu Li and Niu Ben.
As the City Lord’s Mansion was vast, these agents didn’t know the exact locations of Niu Li and Niu Ben’s residences. They also dared not use their divine sense to probe, as it could easily expose them, so they had to search slowly.
However, these Flying Tiger City agents didn’t notice that with every step they took, each bluestone tile beneath their feet faintly flickered with green light.
To prevent unauthorised intrusions, City Lord Niu Mang had long ago spent a fortune to set up a formation within the mansion.
Although these agents carried a token and wore the armour of the Battle Soldier Team, their auras had not been recorded in the formation. Thus, as soon as they entered the mansion, the formation began to activate slowly.
At that moment, Niu Mang, who was cultivating inside the Demon Suppression Tower, suddenly opened his eyes, his brows tightly furrowed.
“What’s wrong?” Chen Ping asked, noticing his reaction.
“Strangers have infiltrated the City Lord’s Mansion. I need to go check,” Niu Mang said as he stood and left the Demon Suppression Tower.
Chen Ping followed him, and the two soon arrived in the courtyard.
Before long, they spotted a suspicious group of Battle Soldiers in the courtyard of the mansion.
“There’s never been a Battle Soldier Team scheduled to patrol the mansion at night,” Niu Mang said softly.
“It’s highly likely this team is made up of impostors,” Chen Ping remarked.
Niu Mang nodded, then pulled out a dark stone from his pocket, inscribed with obscure symbols.
As Niu Mang channelled streams of immortal energy into the stone, beams of white light suddenly shot out around the City Lord’s Mansion.
These beams connected, forming a barrier that enveloped the entire mansion.
“We’ve been discovered, retreat!” the shopkeeper of Tianbao Pavilion exclaimed, not expecting to be found out so soon after entering.
At the same time, piercing alarms blared throughout the mansion, and countless guards poured out.
Bai Yi and Mad Immortal also rushed out, looking tense, “What’s happening?”
“It’s fine, some intruders, likely Flying Tiger City’s agents. It’ll be dealt with soon,” Niu Mang reassured them.
“Damn it, Flying Tiger City just won’t give up. Do they really want a fight to the death?” Bai Yi said angrily.
“Does Rhino City have some feud with Flying Tiger City?” Chen Ping asked, noting from Bai Yi’s words that such incidents seemed frequent.
“Not exactly a feud. Flying Tiger City just has fewer resources and often comes to our territory to compete for them,” Niu Mang explained.
“They’re also envious of our Purgatory Arena and want to seize it, which is why conflicts keep arising.”
“We’re only ten thousand miles apart, the closest two cities, so clashes are normal.”
Niu Mang seemed unfazed, accepting that disputes over resources were commonplace.
