It was obvious that the Four Nether Mansions’ strength far surpassed that of Sun Moon City!
In today’s world, might makes right!
Seeing the sudden appearance of the Huo family, Lin Chong’s frown deepened!
Now, the balance had completely tipped in favor of the Four Nether Mansions!
“I can’t keep hiding anymore. It’s a matter of life and death now!”
The Tenth Hall Master slowly stepped out from the crowd!
“Tenth Hall Master, I didn’t expect you to show up. Quick, join us and help take down this Chen Ping!”
Qian Xiaohan saw the Tenth Hall Master and hurriedly called out!
After all, Elder Qian of their Qian Sect was part of the Ten Halls, so he was quite familiar with the Tenth Hall Master!
He assumed the Tenth Hall Master had come to aid them!
“Sorry, I’m here to help Mr. Chen…”
With that, the Tenth Hall Master walked over to Chen Ping’s side!
His choice stunned everyone, leaving them baffled as to why the Tenth Hall Master would side with Chen Ping!
“Tenth Hall Master, you’re betraying the Divine Hall. Aren’t you afraid of their punishment?”
Huo Qing, seeing the Tenth Hall Master align with Chen Ping, angrily questioned him!
“Get lost. I’ll help whoever I want. What’s it to you?”
“I used to give the Huo family some face and let things slide, but now that the Ten Halls are gone, I fear nothing.”
The Tenth Hall Master cursed loudly!
No matter how strong the opposing forces were, he’d choose Chen Ping!
Because he’d witnessed Mr. Shi’s power firsthand, a scene etched deeply into his heart!
“Just one more third-grade Immortal Transformation cultivator. No big deal…”
Ming Shao sneered coldly!
“And what if you add me?” A voice like rolling thunder boomed as the Northern Domain Lord slowly appeared!
“Northern Domain Lord, instead of cultivating and managing the northern cultivators, you want to meddle in our fight?”
Qian Xiaohan asked the Northern Domain Lord!
“Nonsense. If I don’t step in, my precious son-in-law will be bullied to death by you lot.”
The Northern Domain Lord walked toward Chen Ping, patted his shoulder, and said, “Good son-in-law, don’t worry. I’m here to help!”
The Northern Domain Lord walked toward Chen Ping, patted his shoulder, and said, “Good son-in-law, don’t worry. I’m here to help!”
“Northern Domain Lord, what’s that supposed to mean? He’s my daughter’s man!”
Lin Chong asked the Northern Domain Lord!
“Emperor Lin, he’s my daughter’s man. We’ve met long ago!”
The Northern Domain Lord pulled Hua Yueying forward, “Daughter, isn’t Chen Ping your man?”
Lin Chong pulled Lin Keting forward too, “Daughter, isn’t Chen Ping your man?”
Lin Keting and Hua Yueying stood there, utterly embarrassed. How could they say something like that in front of so many people?
“Cough, cough…”
Chen Ping coughed awkwardly twice, “You two, both of them are my women. The three of us have already slept together…”
The Northern Domain Lord and Lin Chong exchanged a glance, then burst into laughter.
The Northern Domain Lord said, “Does this mean we’re in-laws now?”
“Absolutely, it does…” Lin Chong nodded!
“Enough with the family bonding crap. Hand over Chen Ping, or you all die…”
“Even with the Northern Domain Lord, you’ve got no chance of winning!”
Ming Shao snapped impatiently!
“And what if you add us?”
Two fiery red figures appeared, Wenshi and Wenqing from the Fire Incineration Sect.
Behind them followed several black-robed figures, their robes marked with a fiery red flame emblem!
Chen Ping, seeing their attire, was momentarily stunned, but he quickly realized this man wasn’t the one who’d called himself Ning Zizai!
“Wenshi, what’s the Fire Incineration Sect stirring up trouble for? Do you have some connection with Chen Ping? Or has your sister become his woman too?”
Ming Shao, seeing Wenshi and Wenqing, asked in irritation!
“We’ve got no connection. My sister and I just don’t like the look of you and want to teach you a lesson!”
Wenshi replied!
At that moment, Chen Ping stared at the siblings in shock. He hadn’t expected them to be from the Fire Incineration Sect!
Even more surprising, he never thought the Fire Incineration Sect would step in to help him!
