**Spirit Stones, Pills, Immortal Herbs…**
The young master of a great family was indeed wealthy!
Chen Ping didn’t hold back, distributing everything among the group and keeping nothing for himself.
“Miss Hua, I have a favor to ask…”
After distributing the resources, Chen Ping turned to Hua Yueying.
“You want to learn ‘Heavenly Rain Descent,’ don’t you?”
Hua Yueying said with a smile.
Chen Ping nodded somewhat sheepishly. After all, this was a secret technique passed down from Hua Yueying’s mother to her. It felt a bit inappropriate for him to learn it.
But Chen Ping really wanted to master it. Supportive formations like this could sometimes be even more useful than offensive or defensive ones.
“Mr. Chen, you and Miss Hua are practically family now. What’s there to be shy about? What’s hers is yours, and what’s yours is hers!”
Xuan Bin laughed heartily.
“That’s right, her father has already acknowledged you as his son-in-law. Why don’t you and Miss Hua start dual cultivation today?”
“There’s an old saying: ‘If you want to master something, sleep with your master.'”
“If Mr. Chen wants to learn Miss Hua’s formation, of course, he has to sleep with her!”
Zhou Tang and Cang Yue joined in the teasing.
Hua Yueying, on the other hand, blushed deeply and lowered her head in embarrassment.
“I’ll take my leave now. If my father can’t find me, he’ll worry.”
Lin Kefan felt a bit out of place and decided to return to Sun-Moon City.
“Brother-in-law, won’t you stay and rest for a few days?” Chen Ping asked.
“No, no…”
With that, Lin Kefan vanished in a flash.
He needed to return to Sun-Moon City as soon as possible to tell his sister to act quickly. Otherwise, Chen Ping might be snatched up by other women!
After Lin Kefan left, Chen Ping turned to Hua Yueying. “Miss Hua, come with me…”
Chen Ping led Hua Yueying into a secluded room.
After all, the “Heavenly Rain Descent” was her family’s secret technique. It couldn’t be taught in public.
Seeing Chen Ping and Hua Yueying leave together, Xuan Bin chuckled. “Looks like Miss Hua will soon be our boss’s wife. She won’t be just a colleague anymore.”
“Being a woman is great. If I were a woman, I’d latch onto someone like Mr. Chen too. It would make life so much easier!” Cang Yue sighed.
“Enough joking around. Now that the Huo family’s young master is dead, they won’t let this go easily.”
“And with the Tenth Hall destroyed, do you think the Divine Hall will just sit back and do nothing?”
Zhou Tang interjected.
Hearing this, Xuan Bin and Cang Yue’s expressions turned serious.
They couldn’t hide in Emperor Xiao’s dynasty forever, could they?
“Don’t worry, everyone. The forces behind Chen Ping are far more powerful than you imagine. A Transformation Realm expert was killed by a trace of fortune left behind. You can imagine how strong Chen Ping’s backer is.”
At this moment, Yun Li spoke up calmly.
Xuan Bin and the others exchanged glances, then looked at Yun Li. “And you are…?”
They didn’t recognize Yun Li, who had been imprisoned in the Tenth Hall for many years and hadn’t been seen in public.
“Yun Li, First Prince of the Tenth Hall…”
Yun Li clasped his hands in greeting.
“A member of the Tenth Hall?” Xuan Bin and the others were startled, immediately assuming defensive stances.
“Everyone, calm down. Although Brother Yun Li is from the Tenth Hall, he’s not an enemy of Mr. Chen. In fact, they’re friends.”
Emperor Xiao Yuan Shan quickly explained.
Xuan Bin and the others were utterly confused. They couldn’t understand how a prince of the Tenth Hall could be friends with Chen Ping, especially after they had just destroyed the Tenth Hall.
Seeing their bewilderment, Yun Li smiled. “You don’t need to know too much. Just understand that following Chen Ping will lead to a bright future.”
“If it weren’t for my status, I’d want to follow that kid Chen Ping too…”
With that, Yun Li left with a faint smile.
Yun Li was once a prodigy, but he had fallen from grace after breaking the Divine Hall’s rules.
