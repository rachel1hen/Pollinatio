Chen Ping gripped the Dragon-Slaying Sword and charged toward the palace, unleashing a sword light that aimed to cleave the towering structure in two!
But just as he rushed toward it, a golden beam suddenly shot out from within the palace!
Bang!
Chen Ping’s sword light shattered instantly, and his body seemed to hit an invisible barrier, crashing heavily back to the ground!
Scaling the stone steps in one leap was clearly impossible!
Chen Ping’s face was full of shock. He had already advanced two levels, yet without even seeing his opponent, he was forced back to where he started!
Staring at the palace, his expression grew increasingly grave. If the third level was this formidable, the guardians beyond it would be even more unimaginable!
Left with no choice, Chen Ping began ascending the stone steps one by one, slowly making his way toward the palace!
He didn’t use any power, didn’t swing his sword, and carried not a hint of hostility!
Like this, he reached the palace entrance without obstruction. The moment he arrived, the heavy doors creaked open slowly!
Stepping inside, Chen Ping found the interior pitch-black, like the depths of a tiger’s maw, instilling an inexplicable sense of dread!
“A mere Great Ascension Realm cultivator dares to challenge the third level?”
At that moment, a light flickered within the palace, illuminating a figure!
Chen Ping looked over and saw a scholar dressed in a pristine robe, his hair tied with a band, exuding the air of a refined gentleman!
No matter how you looked at him, he didn’t seem like a powerful master!
“This junior, Chen Ping, pays respects to Senior!”
Chen Ping bowed politely with clasped hands!
Anyone guarding this place had to be from the Celestial Realm, so calling him “Senior” wasn’t out of place!
“With your strength, you made it to me? Are the guardians of the first two levels that useless?”
The scholar said with disdain!
Hearing this outside the palace, Li Chunfeng opened his mouth and silently mouthed a curse: “MLGB.”
“Senior, that’s not true. The seniors of the first two levels are incredibly strong, just restrained here with their power suppressed.”
“I assume you too are imprisoned here, Senior? You probably can’t leave this palace!”
Chen Ping said to the scholar.
“Correct, I am indeed confined here, but my life is quite comfortable. Every day, devotees bring offerings. So what if I can’t leave this palace?”
The scholar replied smugly!
“Senior, aren’t you mistaken? This third level seems to have only this palace, where are these devotees?”
Chen Ping asked, puzzled!
“How could that be?” The scholar frowned!
“If you don’t believe me, Senior, you can look outside…” Chen Ping suggested!
As he spoke, the entire palace suddenly lit up brightly!
The scholar peered out through the palace windows and saw a hazy void outside, as if shrouded in chaos. There was no world, let alone any devotees!
“How could this happen? Why is it like this?”
The scholar’s face paled, his voice trembling with shock!
“Senior, it was like this when I entered the third level. I don’t know what’s going on either!”
Chen Ping answered honestly!
The scholar fell into deep thought. After a moment, he said bitterly, “Perhaps they thought I was living too comfortably and removed this level’s world?”
“No matter, since you’re here to challenge it, you’ll have to get past me first!”
“Senior, then I won’t hold back!” Chen Ping gripped the Dragon-Slaying Sword, not daring to let his guard down!
Activating his Indestructible Golden Body and summoning all his powers, he swung a fierce slash at the scholar.
Bang!
The strike landed, but the scholar waved a hand dismissively. In the next moment, he was sent reeling by the sword light, his chest splitting open as blood gushed out!
Chen Ping was dumbfounded. Was the third level’s guardian really this weak?
The scholar, equally stunned, muttered in disbelief, “How is my strength suppressed again, reduced to less than a tenth?”
