“Father…” Sang Lan wanted to say something, but Sang Tianyang raised his hand to interrupt her.
He knew what Sang Lan was about to say. For someone who betrayed them, they should be eradicated to prevent future troubles.
If they let the tiger return to the mountain, it would surely cause problems later.
However, Sang Tianyang did not act, for in the past, he had taken someone’s love, which was his own mistake.
The dust settled, and Glazed City was now nothing but broken walls and ruins.
Sang Lan understood her father’s meaning and gently supported Sang Tianyang’s unsteady body, “Father, you’ve lost too much vital blood, hurry back to heal.”
Sang Tianyang nodded and looked at Chen Ping, “Young friend Chen, thank you for today… If not for you, the Asura Hall would likely…”
“You’re too kind, Hall Master,” Chen Ping said with a salute, “If you hadn’t summoned the Asura Guards, I would probably be dead by now.”
He paused, glancing at Mo Qingyun hiding behind a stone pillar, “Qingyun, we should go.”
Mo Qingyun quickly approached, still visibly shaken, but bowed respectfully to Sang Tianyang and his daughter, “Thank you, Hall Master, and Miss Sang Lan for saving us.”
Sang Tianyang looked deeply at Chen Ping and took out a token engraved with the Asura totem from his chest, “This is the guest elder token of Asura Hall. If you encounter trouble in the Second Heaven, young friend Chen, you can use this token to find me.”
Chen Ping accepted the token and stored it in his storage bag, “Thank you for your kindness, Hall Master. Until we meet again.”
Under the setting sun, the figures of Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun gradually disappeared beyond the ruins of Glazed City.
In the distance, thunderclouds rolled across the sky. Sang Tianyang gazed in the direction where the Grand Elder had left, clutching a jade pendant that emanated a faint chill. He wasn’t sure if his actions were right or wrong.
But some grudges, even settled with blades, were hard to resolve, while some chance encounters, though fleeting, could lead to life-and-death bonds.
“Lan’er, let’s go back too,” Sang Tianyang turned to leave, noticeably aged.
…
Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun departed, walking through the void.
“Chen Ping, you don’t look well. Why don’t we go home so you can rest properly?” Mo Qingyun said.
“No need. I’ll find a place to recover in the tower.”
Chen Ping found a secluded spot and brought Mo Qingyun into the tower.
Inside, Chen Ping slowly closed his eyes, powerful auras emanating from him, causing the void within the tower to tremble.
In the recent battle, though Chen Ping had won, he was injured, yet the gains were substantial.
If one only cultivated in seclusion without real combat, even if their realm improved, their true strength would be greatly diminished.
The battle with the Grand Elder had given Chen Ping many insights.
Gradually, the aura around Chen Ping grew stronger, and the surrounding void began to distort.
Not far away, Mo Qingyun watched him with concern, not daring to cultivate herself.
After an unknown amount of time, Chen Ping suddenly opened his eyes, two beams of light flashing within them.
Boom!
A terrifying aura erupted from Chen Ping’s body, and Mo Qingyun felt an oppressive pressure that made her breathless.
“Fourth-grade Loose Immortal Realm…”
Chen Ping took a deep breath, a smile spreading across his face.
He hadn’t expected that the battle with the Grand Elder would lead to such insights, allowing him to break through to the Fourth-grade Loose Immortal Realm.
“If I fought that Grand Elder again, I’d make him wet himself!”
Chen Ping’s confidence soared.
Each advancement in his realm multiplied his strength exponentially.
Every life-and-death battle brought new gains, as such battles were the best way to unlock one’s potential.
Chen Ping now eagerly wished to find another expert to fight.
In the previous battle, the Grand Elder had burned his origin to reach the Ninth-grade Loose Immortal Realm, making Chen Ping realize his own strength wasn’t enough to defeat such an opponent, so he had relied on two warrior statues.
But now, if he faced a Ninth-grade Loose Immortal again, Chen Ping wouldn’t fear them and could hold his own.
Of course, if he encountered a Ninth-grade Loose Immortal who could also fight across realms, Chen Ping would still be no match.
