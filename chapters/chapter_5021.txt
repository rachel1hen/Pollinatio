Is it because the cultivation of the human race is more difficult compared to those demon or beast races?
The man said with a face full of joy, “Where are your people? Where are they?”
“Just us few!” Mo Qingyun said!
The man was stunned, and the smile on his face vanished, “Just you few, what use are you? Now seventy percent of Cangxuan Continent has fallen, you few people are completely useless!”
“I advise you to leave, lest you become someone else’s prisoner!”
“You guy, are you looking down on us few?” Hu Mazi was somewhat unhappy!
But before the man could speak, suddenly the heavens and earth trembled!
The man’s expression changed drastically, his brows furrowed as he said, “You’d better leave quickly, the people from the temple are coming…”
After speaking, from a distance, a dozen black-clad men from the Eight Temples approached, led by an old man in a grey cloth robe with a bun on his head!
Just these dozen people caused the surrounding void to tremble incessantly, and a terrifying pressure came rushing in!
Then, screams were heard all around, many people were pressed to the ground, finding it hard to breathe!
Seeing this, Chen Ping instantly summoned the Dragon-Slaying Sword, a terrifying sword intent surged, and with a gentle wave, that terrifying pressure vanished instantly!
Everyone felt their chests lighten, and they scrambled up from the ground!
At this moment, the man looked at Chen Ping with eyes full of surprise and confusion!
Because he noticed that Chen Ping was only at the first rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, the same as his own realm, yet he could easily dispel this terrifying pressure!
The grey-robed old man was also slightly stunned and soon arrived in front of Chen Ping and the others!
When the old man saw Young Master Huo, he immediately showed excitement!
“Third Elder, save me, save me…” Young Master Huo shouted upon seeing the old man!
“Release our Young Master, and you may be spared!” the Third Elder roared!
The man just now was dumbfounded; he hadn’t expected that among Chen Ping’s group, there was actually a Young Master from the temple.
At this moment, tens of thousands of people had gathered around Chen Ping and the others!
Facing the dozen or so black-clad men from the Eight Temples, these tens of thousands of human cultivators didn’t dare to step forward, each one showing a look of terror!
Seeing this, Chen Ping sighed helplessly, when had the human race become so weak and incompetent!
“With so many of you, are you afraid of their dozen or so people?” Chen Ping asked the man!
“Our strength is no match, numbers alone can’t make up for it,” the man said helplessly!
“Then what do you plan to do?” Chen Ping wanted to see what the people of Cangxuan Continent were thinking!
If they were worth saving, he might lend a hand!
If they were all cowards, Chen Ping didn’t want to waste his time!
“What else can we do, either submit or fight to the death.”
“But we won’t submit, even if we can’t beat them, we’ll at least leave them with a bloody nose.”
“You’re not from Cangxuan Continent, you’d better leave quickly, I’m going to lead people to make a stink and disgust these guys.”
The man said to Chen Ping!
“This is how you resist?” Chen Ping laughed!
“What else can we do?” the man said helplessly!
“Stop being so damn long-winded, release our Young Master immediately, didn’t you hear?” The Third Elder, seeing Chen Ping ignore him, shouted loudly again!
“You’re really annoying…” Chen Ping finally looked at the Third Elder, and with a sudden wave of the Dragon-Slaying Sword!
A sharp sword beam streaked across like a meteor!
The surrounding space seemed to compress instantly, everyone almost froze, finding it hard to move!
The Third Elder’s eyes widened, his face full of disbelief!
He watched helplessly as the sword beam sliced across his neck!
His head flew high, he even saw his headless body falling straight to the ground!
His head, still in mid-air, kept blinking, his consciousness not yet faded!
