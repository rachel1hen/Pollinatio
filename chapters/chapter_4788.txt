“Oh, our young masters know loads of folks, plenty who come here claim they’re mates with those two.”
“But our Young Master Huo Ming kicked the bucket a while back, you don’t even know that, guess you weren’t too tight with them!”
The old man said, pulling out a sound transmission jade slip!
With a flick of spiritual energy into the slip, a voice soon crackled through!
“What’s up?”
It was a deep, aged tone!
“Elder Liu, there’s a special case here wanting into the Lawless Land, need you to come check it out yourself!”
The old man said, all hushed and humble!
“Got it!” came the flat reply!
A moment later, a terrifying aura rolled in, then an old man in fancy robes appeared, the void twisting around him as he stepped out!
Second-Grade Immortal Transformation Realm, clearly a cut above, from strength to swanky threads!
“Elder Liu, this one’s a big fish…”
The black-robed old man sidled up to Elder Liu, whispering!
Elder Liu nodded, strutting over to Chen Ping with an air of importance, sizing him up, “You, just a Third-Grade Mahayana Realm, what’re you doing in the Lawless Land?”
“For fun, that allowed?” Chen Ping said coolly!
“Allowed, sure, as long as you pay the fee, we…”
“I’ve already paid!” Chen Ping cut him off mid-sentence!
“Elder Liu, road tolls, sanitation fees, head taxes, he’s covered them all…” The black-robed old man winked frantically at Elder Liu!
“I know he’s paid, he can go in, no doubt, but his realm’s too low, you know the Heaven Ladder’s about to pop up, loads of heavy hitters are flooding the Lawless Land, at your level, without protection, you’d be dead in a heartbeat.”
“So, to enter, you’ll need someone watching your back, someone’s got to vouch for your safety, that’s where the protection fee comes in!”
Elder Liu said, all serious-like!
“How much?” Chen Ping asked!
“Five thousand…”
“Cough cough cough…”
The black-robed old man hacked away, then yanked Elder Liu aside.
“Elder Liu, this is a fat catch, don’t lowball it!” he hissed!
“Five thousand feels right, don’t ask for too much, you’ll scare him off!”
Elder Liu said!
“No chance, he didn’t even blink, already tossed me seven thousand immortal spirit stones!” the black-robed old man shot back!
“That loaded…” Elder Liu froze, then broke into a giddy grin!
Chen Ping, watching the two mutter, smirked too!
Clueless pair!
“We just hashed it out, given your situation, it’s fifty thousand immortal spirit stones.”
“Pay up fifty thousand, and we’ll guarantee your safety in the Lawless Land.”
“When the Heaven Ladder drops, if you fancy a go, we’ll even lend a hand!”
Elder Liu laid it out for Chen Ping, probably worried fifty thousand might spook him off!
“Fifty thousand immortal spirit stones, not much…”
Chen Ping didn’t flinch, pulling out a storage pouch and chucking it at Elder Liu!
Elder Liu checked the stones, his face splitting into a beaming smile, “All set, in you go, I’ll get someone on your safety right away.”
“Anything else you need in the Lawless Land, just say, I’ll sort it!”
“Cheers!” Chen Ping said, strolling in without a backward glance!
“We’ve struck it rich, bloody rich, just hand over a thousand up top, the rest’s ours!”
The black-robed old man crowed, buzzing!
“What’re you so chuffed about? These fifty thousand are mine, you keep the six thousand from your seven after passing up a thousand, I’ll pretend I didn’t see!”
Elder Liu glared at the black-robed old man!
