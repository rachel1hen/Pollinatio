Chen Ping was just about to speak up to defuse the situation when he saw Mo Chen hobbling over on his crutch. His gaze swept over Ling Xue, then turned to Chen Ping; a knowing smile flashed in his eyes. He stroked his beard and said, “It’s good for young people to have vigorous energy, but everything should be in moderation. Excess is as bad as deficiency.”
Although these words were not explicit, the implication in that look was utterly obvious.
Ling Xue heard it clearly; she was so embarrassed that her neck turned red. She lowered her head and quickly ran back to her room without even looking back.
It was all Chen Ping’s fault for not knowing how to be gentle; for a whole year without stopping, it had swollen. Ling Xue even walked a bit awkwardly.
Chen Ping awkwardly touched his nose. Mo Chen stepped forward and sized up Chen Ping. When he sensed the thick and majestic Earth Immortal Realm spiritual energy on Chen Ping, a shocked expression appeared on his old face. “You… you have actually broken through to the Earth Immortal Realm?”
One must know that Chen Ping had only entered the Loose Immortal Realm a few months ago. Such cultivation speed was simply unheard of.
Chen Ping nodded with a smile. “Thanks to my junior sister; dual cultivating with me, I fortunately made some progress.”
Mo Chen nodded repeatedly; his eyes were full of gratification. “Good. Good. My Sword Sect finally has a powerhouse who can stand on his own.”
He turned his head to look at Hu Mazi and sensed the unfathomable aura on the other party; he was even more shocked, his eyes widening. “Master Hu… what is this?”
“It’s just recovering to the ninth grade of the Earth Immortal Realm; not worth mentioning.”
Hu Mazi pretended to be calm and waved his hand, but his slightly raised chin betrayed his pride.
Mo Chen sucked in a breath of cold air. It had only been three days since they last met; not only had Chen Ping broken through to the Earth Immortal Realm, but Hu Mazi had also recovered to the ninth grade of the Earth Immortal Realm. This Demon Suppressing Pagoda was truly a divine object.
“You have just broken through and need to consolidate for some days. These few days, Sword Saint City has been much calmer. You should just stay put properly.”
Mo Chen said to Chen Ping and Hu Mazi.
He was afraid that Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, having just broken through, would go looking for trouble with the Evil Dao Hall.
After all, having just broken through, they needed to consolidate.
“Thank you for the reminder, Master. I know.” Chen Ping nodded.
In the following few days, Chen Ping, Ling Xue, and Hu Mazi were all consolidating their current cultivation.
After Ling Xue came out of the Demon Suppressing Pagoda, although she had advanced to the seventh grade of the Earth Immortal Realm, Chen Ping always felt that there was a trace of imperceptible instability in the flow of her spiritual energy.
In the pagoda, for the sake of rapid progress, their dual cultivation had fused spiritual energy too hastily. Chen Ping had injected his primordial yang into Ling Xue time and time again, allowing Ling Xue to break through the realm barrier, but it also put considerable pressure on her meridians.
This morning, Chen Ping specially had people clear a piece of empty ground on the east side of the martial arts field. He also ordered disciples to bring dozens of “Sinking Water Jades” containing pure earth attribute spiritual energy and arrange them into a simple spirit gathering array according to the seven-star positions.
“Ling Xue, come and try.”
Chen Ping patted the jade platform beside him. The Sinking Water Jade gleamed with a warm lustre under the morning light; spiritual energy faintly flowed between the stone seams.
Ling Xue came over holding her long sword. When she saw that jade array, a flash of curiosity appeared in her eyes. “Senior Brother, this is…”
“A Sinking Water Jade spirit gathering array; it’s most suitable for nourishing meridians.”
Chen Ping gestured for her to sit cross-legged on the jade platform at the array’s eye. “You have just broken through the realm; your spiritual energy is strong but not stable. Today, we will use the most basic method to gradually integrate the spiritual energy into your meridians.”
Ling Xue sat down as instructed. As soon as she circulated her cultivation technique, she felt the surrounding Sinking Water Jades suddenly light up with a faint earthy yellow halo. A gentle yet heavy spiritual energy surged from all directions, wrapping around her limbs and bones like a warm spring.
“Concentrate and calm your mind; follow my guidance.” Chen Ping also sat cross-legged opposite her; his palms hovered in the air, with his palms facing her dantian.
The Earth Immortal Realm spiritual energy flowed like a trickling stream, slowly injecting into her body and gently travelling along her meridians.
