As long as it wasn’t a matter of life and death, the black market bosses wouldn’t intervene.
They could only honour their bets and hand over the immortal coins.
In a single day, Bai Yi led Chen Ping to sweep through all the black markets in Rhino City, winning countless immortal coins and resources.
Back at the Spirit Fox Gang, Bai Yi was so thrilled he could barely contain himself, almost wanting to hug and kiss Chen Ping.
“My dear son-in-law, forget about staying in any inn from now on. The Spirit Fox Gang is your home. I’ll arrange a luxurious, comfortable room for you,” Bai Yi said to Chen Ping.
Chen Ping nodded, then gestured towards Hu Mazi and Xiu Rui. “My two friends…”
“They’re your friends, so they’re our guests. They can stay here too,” Bai Yi said generously.
“But their identities…” Chen Ping was concerned that Hu Mazi and Xiu Rui’s human identities might leak, causing trouble for the Spirit Fox Gang.
“No problem. As long as they don’t wander around, there won’t be any issues in the Spirit Fox Gang,” Bai Yi assured.
“Master Hu, Friend Xiu, what do you think?” Chen Ping asked them.
“I’ll follow your arrangements,” Xiu Rui replied indifferently. Having been rescued by Chen Ping, he had no choice but to stick with him.
Otherwise, with his human identity, he wouldn’t survive in Rhino City.
Hu Mazi, however, seemed a bit hesitant. “There are still two women at the inn. Can we bring them here?”
“Of course, I’ll arrange separate rooms for them,” Bai Yi said before Chen Ping could respond.
“Great, I’ll go fetch them!” Hu Mazi said excitedly, heading off to get the two women.
In the days that followed, Chen Ping and the others didn’t leave the Spirit Fox Gang. After all, the gang had everything they needed, like a small city.
Inside the Demon-Suppressing Tower, Chen Ping trained relentlessly. With the supply of immortal coins and abundant resources, his cultivation speed surged.
In just half a month, Chen Ping’s realm had astonishingly reached the Eighth Rank of Immortal Transformation!
In the outside world, half a month was equivalent to fifty months—several years—inside the Demon-Suppressing Tower.
When Chen Ping emerged, everyone was stunned that in just half a month, he had skyrocketed from First Rank to Eighth Rank of Immortal Transformation. It was unbelievable.
“My dear son-in-law, your cultivation speed is simply astounding. But the consumption rate is equally shocking. The resources we won from the arenas are nearly depleted,” Bai Yi said with a wry smile.
If there were still resources to support Chen Ping, he wouldn’t have left the Demon-Suppressing Tower.
“Father-in-law, this is already impressive. It’s just a pity that I used up all those resources myself,” Chen Ping said, a bit embarrassed.
“Son-in-law, don’t say that. In the future, the entire Spirit Fox Gang will be yours. Of course, the resources are for you to use!” Bai Yi said, patting Chen Ping’s shoulder.
Chen Ping was deeply moved and truly admired Bai Yi as his father-in-law.
“Father-in-law, is there a trial ground or something similar in Rhino City? My cultivation has advanced so much, I need some trials to master it,” Chen Ping said. Although his realm had reached the Eighth Rank, the rapid advancement meant he needed real combat to hone his skills.
He couldn’t just pick random people to spar with and beat them up in Rhino City.
“There is a Purgatory Field in Rhino City, but it’s extremely dangerous. Your current realm might not be suitable,” Bai Yi replied. “Plus, entering the Purgatory Field costs five hundred thousand immortal coins each time. Most people can’t afford that price.”
“Purgatory Field? Why is there a fee? Who gets the money? And what’s in the Purgatory Field?” Chen Ping asked, puzzled.
