The two thanked Guide Wang, got up and left the teahouse.
Just as they walked out of the town, Hu Mazi spoke. “I did not expect the Divine Kingdom to be so overbearing, and that Sixth Hall of the Divine Palace sounds even worse than the Evil Path Hall.
The Thunder Sound Temple we are looking for is in the middle, with strong enemies on both sides, the waters of this Sixth Heaven are much deeper than the Fifth Heaven.”
Chen Ping’s gaze was profound, looking south. “The more dangerous it is, the more careful we must be. First find Infinite Daoist, figure out the situation with the Sixth Hall of the Divine Palace, then make plans.”
The two were about to rise into the air and leave, when suddenly they heard sounds of fighting from the nearby dense forest, mixed with a woman’s muffled groan.
Hu Mazi’s eyes lit up. “There’s excitement to watch? Come on, let’s go take a look.”
Chen Ping did not stop him, he also noticed a special aura in the fighting sounds, it was neither the spiritual power of human cultivators nor the demonic qi of demon beasts, but a kind of majestic power, somewhat similar to the divine clan that Guide Wang mentioned.
The two quietly sneaked into the dense forest, hiding behind an ancient tree, looking towards the direction of the fighting sounds.
In the clearing, a woman was fiercely battling three cultivators wearing silver armour.
The woman was dressed in a white long skirt, with golden divine patterns embroidered on the hem, her jet-black long hair fluttered in the wind, her appearance was stunningly beautiful, yet carrying a trace of cold arrogance.
She had no weapon in her hands, relying solely on her jade hands to execute divine abilities, golden light flowed at her fingertips, each wave forcing back one divine guard.
The three divine guards held long spears, with double-wing divine patterns engraved on the spears, they coordinated seamlessly, forming a triangular formation, trapping the woman in the middle.
“Your Highness the Princess, surrender without resistance.”
The leading divine guard said coldly. “His Majesty has already ordered, as long as you go back and admit your mistake, he will spare your life. Otherwise, we can only forcibly take you back to the Divine Kingdom.”
“Admit my mistake?”
The woman sneered, her voice clear yet carrying a hint of chill. “I have done nothing wrong. Father, for the sake of allying with the Divine Palace, actually wants to marry me to the son of the Third Hall Master of the Divine Palace, I will never go back.”
The leading divine guard’s face darkened. “Your Highness the Princess, this is a major affair of the Divine Kingdom, not something you can be willful about. Since you refuse to cooperate, do not blame us for being impolite.”
After speaking, he waved his hand, the other two divine guards launched attacks simultaneously, the long spears carrying sharp auras, directly aiming for the woman’s vital points.
A flash of panic appeared in the woman’s eyes, although her cultivation had reached Seventh Grade of Earth Immortal Realm, facing three divine guards at Eighth Grade of Earth Immortal Realm, she gradually fell into disadvantage.
A long spear grazed her shoulder, leaving a blood mark, the white long skirt was instantly stained red.
“If we do not act now, this little lady is about to be captured.”
Hu Mazi said in a low voice, he had already taken out talismans in his hand. “Looking at her, she should be the escaped divine clan noble that Guide Wang mentioned, perhaps we can ask her for more information about the Divine Kingdom and the Divine Palace.”
Most importantly, Hu Mazi had taken a fancy to this female cultivator, after saving her, he could have some fun, vent properly, it would be worth it.
Chen Ping glanced at Hu Mazi, naturally knowing this guy’s little schemes.
However, the woman before them seemed to indeed be from the Divine Kingdom, perhaps through her, they could learn about the Divine Kingdom and the Sixth Hall of the Divine Palace.
So Chen Ping nodded. “Make a move.”
Before the words finished, Hu Mazi threw out two talismans. “Evil-Breaking Talisman.” Two golden lights flashed, landing on the long spears of two divine guards, the divine patterns on the long spears instantly dimmed, their power greatly reduced.
Chen Ping’s figure flashed, executing the Imperial Fire Step, instantly appearing behind the leading divine guard, the Dragon Slaying Sword pointed straight at his back heart.
“Who?”
The leading divine guard was greatly shocked, hurriedly turned to block. But his speed was far inferior to Chen Ping’s, the golden sword qi instantly pierced through his armour, stabbing his shoulder.
He let out a miserable cry, blood spurted out.
