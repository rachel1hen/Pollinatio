“This is insane, the top three powers in the Heavenly Human Realm are actually about to clash!”
“Why is the Fire Incineration Sect suddenly helping that Chen Ping? What’s their connection?”
“It’s getting wild. Better stay back a bit, looks like a lot of people are going to die.”
The crowd watched this scene unfold, whispering among themselves!
Ming Shao’s face darkened, his eyes blazing with fury as he glared at Wenshi, “Wenshi, don’t think that just because your Fire Incineration Sect is famous and called the number one sect in the Heavenly Human Realm, you’re untouchable.”
“If you don’t want to die, get lost. I won’t bother with you. But if you insist on helping that Chen Ping, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”
“Cut the crap. If you want to fight, let’s fight. Haven’t you always been cocky, looking down on everyone?”
Wenshi had long been fed up with Ming Shao and saw this as a perfect chance to take him down!
To be honest, he had no real ties with Chen Ping. Wenshi and his sister Wenqing were just purely annoyed with Ming Shao!
They understood the saying well: the enemy of my enemy is my friend!
In an instant, the tension skyrocketed, the atmosphere growing oppressively heavy.
At that moment, a single move from anyone would spark an all-out brawl!
Just as the stifling tension left everyone breathless, a sudden disturbance rippled through the heavens and earth. Strange white beams of light enveloped the Lawless Land!
The entire space of the Lawless Land seemed to buckle under pressure, each person feeling as if a mountain weighed down on them!
“The Heavenly Ladder! The Heavenly Ladder has appeared…”
Someone shouted loudly!
All eyes snapped upward, spotting the massive Heavenly Ladder, like a towering mountain, slowly emerging in the void!
Rumble…
Finally, the Heavenly Ladder crashed heavily onto the ground.
The moment it landed, everyone surged toward it!
The two groups, previously at each other’s throats, ignored their feud and raced toward the Heavenly Ladder!
Chen Ping flashed forward, arriving in front of it!
The Heavenly Ladder was colossal, stretching into the clouds!
It had nine steps, each with a glowing portal above it!
On the first tier of the Heavenly Ladder, someone had carved two large characters: “Ascend Heaven…”
Staring at the enormous structure, Chen Ping’s expression grew solemn. The ladder radiated an ancient, weathered aura that inspired awe!
Clearly, this Heavenly Ladder was deliberately crafted, perhaps by a celestial immortal or an even higher-level cultivator!
To beings like them, the cultivators of the Heavenly Human Realm were likely mere ants or pawns!
By now, some couldn’t hold back and charged toward the Heavenly Ladder!
But few lingered on the first tier, most rushing straight for the third!
“Why aren’t these people going to the first tier?”
Chen Ping asked, puzzled!
“Chen Ping, these people have been to the Heavenly Ladder before and cleared the first tier. Once you pass a tier, it leaves a clearance mark on you, so you don’t need to redo it when you return!”
“Since you’ve never entered the Heavenly Ladder, you have to start from the first tier. We can’t go with you either, because after passing it, we can’t re-enter the first tier!”
Yun Li explained to Chen Ping!
Chen Ping finally got it. Once a tier was cleared, you couldn’t go back, only move up to the next!
“Don’t worry, the first tier is simple. With your strength, you’ll breeze through it.”
“Plus, the cultivators in the first-tier world aren’t that strong. They can’t really hurt you!”
“The tricky part is the clearance condition. You have to figure it out yourself. The challenge differs each time.”
Lin Kefan patted Chen Ping’s shoulder and said!
