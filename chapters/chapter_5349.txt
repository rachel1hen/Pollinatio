Hu Mazi leaned over and glanced at the transaction amount on the dossier, drawing in a sharp breath. “Good heavens, a full hundred thousand top-grade immortal stones! What on earth is this scoundrel up to?”
“He wants to use a hundred thousand demon souls to disrupt the Sixth Heaven.”
Chen Ping closed the dossier, a flash of coldness in his eyes. “The Six Halls of the Divine Temple want to use the demon souls to weaken the strength of Leiyin Temple and the Divine Kingdom, so they can expand their territory.
There are probably traitors in the Divine Kingdom who want to use the demon souls to create chaos and overthrow the current ruler, after all, the Divine Kingdom princess’s escape from marriage already indicates internal divisions.
As for the Evil Path Hall, they have always wanted to capture powerful souls to refine into ‘Soul Fiend Pills’, and a hundred thousand demon souls are the best raw material for them.”
The veiled woman nodded. “Mr. Chen’s analysis is correct. However, there is another piece of information that might be useful to you.
Last night, the Divine Kingdom’s divine guards suddenly sealed the west gate of the Divine Capital, saying they were pursuing thieves who stole the Divine Kingdom’s sacred artefact, but according to our spies, what the divine guards are really looking for is a cultivator who can control demonic energy, and that person seems to be connected to the Evil Path Hall.”
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi exchanged a glance, already having a direction in mind.
The divine guards suddenly sealing the capital’s gate must be related to the Leiyin Bell, perhaps that cultivator controlling demonic energy is the one from the Evil Path Hall responsible for transporting the Leiyin Bell.
“Master Hu, I want to go to the Divine Kingdom. This time, with three forces suddenly all involved with the Leiyin Bell, I feel something is off.”
“The people of the divine clan have always been extremely arrogant, they should not practise evil arts, but the Sixth Hall Master of the Divine Temple might be different, many divine clan members in the Divine Temple lack backbone.”
“So I want to understand this Divine Kingdom, to see what the situation is. If the Divine Kingdom, the Divine Temple, and the Evil Path Hall are truly colluding, retrieving the Leiyin Bell will not be easy!”
After leaving the information building, Chen Ping said to Hu Mazi.
“Going to the Divine Kingdom alone is too dangerous, and the Divine Kingdom is full of divine clan cultivators, each one incredibly arrogant. If you go, you will be exposed immediately.”
“Moreover, going like that, you probably cannot even enter the Divine Capital, they will not take you seriously at all…”
Hu Mazi said.
“Do not worry, I have a way. Are they not searching for the princess? I can help the Divine Kingdom capture the princess and bring her back, that way I can enter.”
Chen Ping said.
Hu Mazi listened, somewhat worried. “Do you really want to capture that Divine Kingdom princess? Not to mention she might have hidden guards around her, even if you capture her, the Divine Capital has strict defences. Can you enter with a princess who is full of resistance?”
“Moreover, we do not even know where the princess has gone now, where will you go to capture her?”
“The information building should know, I can get the information from the information building.”
After Chen Ping finished speaking, his fingertip rubbed the token given by Xiao Cui, and soon the specific location of the Divine Kingdom princess appeared in his sea of consciousness.
Chen Ping smiled faintly. “The information building just sent a message, the princess is hiding in Luoxia Valley south of Qingfeng Town, she is alone in the valley, with no divine guards following her.
As for entering the Divine Kingdom, as long as she is in my hands, the Divine Kingdom will not act rashly against me. They want a complete princess for the marriage alliance, they absolutely will not let anything happen to her.”
Hu Mazi still felt uneasy, but he also knew there was no better way at present, so he could only take out a few invisibility talismans from his storage bag. “Take these, Luoxia Valley has a natural spiritual energy barrier, these talismans can help you conceal your aura.
If it really does not work, do not force it, we can think of other methods.”
Chen Ping took the talismans, casually sticking them on his body, and his figure instantly blended into the surrounding light and shadows. “You stay in Qingfeng Town, keep an eye on the movements of the information building. Once there is any trace of the Leiyin Bell, transmit a message to me immediately.
I will be back with a message from the Divine Kingdom in at most ten days.”
As his words fell, he rose into the air and flew towards the direction of Luoxia Valley.
