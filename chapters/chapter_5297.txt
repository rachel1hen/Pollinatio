Li Xiuyuan swung his sword. Golden sword light surged out like a tide, instantly enveloping the entire mountain gate.
The air was filled with a sacred and majestic aura, as if it were about to completely purify all evil things.
“Petty tricks.” Chen Ping snorted coldly. He drew the Dragon-Slaying Sword. A sword aura interwoven with gold and black met it head-on.
“Boom!”
The golden sword light collided with the gold-black sword aura, producing a deafening roar.
Shockingly, the seemingly indestructible golden sword light was torn apart inch by inch by Chen Ping’s sword aura. It ultimately disintegrated into specks of light scattered across the sky.
Li Xiuyuan staggered back three steps. For the first time, shock appeared on his face: “Your swordsmanship… how is it possible that it counters my holy light?”
“Because your holy light is inherently hypocritical.”
Chen Ping advanced step by step. The murderous aura on the Dragon-Slaying Sword grew denser. “The so-called sacred sword intent is merely condensed from the resentment of countless wronged souls. Does it deserve to be called sacred?”
Li Xiuyuan’s expression changed drastically: “You… you’re talking nonsense!”
He clearly had not expected Chen Ping to see through the secret of the Holy Light Sect.
“Whether it’s nonsense, you know in your heart.”
Chen Ping’s voice seemed to come from the depths of the underworld. “The treasure you plundered from the Hu clan back then should be hidden in the secret chamber of the Holy Light Hall, right?”
A trace of ruthlessness flashed in Li Xiuyuan’s eyes: “It seems I can’t let you live!”
He suddenly let out a long howl. The golden light around him erupted again. This time, a faint black aura was mixed in the golden light.
“Holy Light Sword Technique, Third Form: Spear of Judgment!”
Countless golden spears condensed from the golden light. Their tips flickered with cold gleam as they shot towards Chen Ping and the other two.
Mo Chen and Hu Mazi immediately took action. Mo Chen’s long sword turned into a streak of flowing light, constantly shattering the incoming spears. Hu Mazi summoned a yellow shield. Runes shimmered on the shield, blocking the spears outside.
But Li Xiuyuan’s main target was obviously Chen Ping. Most of the spears were shooting towards him.
Chen Ping’s eyes sharpened. The spiritual power and murderous aura in his body surged wildly. In his hand, the Dragon-Slaying Sword turned into a whirlwind interwoven with gold and black.
“Soaring Dragon Form!”
A black dragon phantom, interwoven with sword intent and murderous aura, roared out. It instantly devoured all the incoming spears.
The black dragon phantom did not lose momentum. It continued charging towards Li Xiuyuan.
Li Xiuyuan’s face changed greatly. He had not expected Chen Ping’s strength to be so terrifying. In haste, he raised his golden long sword, attempting to block.
“Puchi!”
The black dragon phantom easily tore through the defence of the golden long sword. It slammed heavily into Li Xiuyuan’s chest.
Li Xiuyuan spat out a mouthful of blood. He flew backwards, crashing heavily into the white jade archway at the mountain gate. The archway shattered instantly.
He struggled to stand up, but found that his dantian had been eroded by the murderous aura. His spiritual power could not circulate smoothly.
“You… who exactly are you?”
Li Xiuyuan looked at Chen Ping approaching step by step. His eyes were filled with fear.
“Someone here to collect a debt.” Chen Ping’s voice was ice-cold. The tip of the Dragon-Slaying Sword pointed straight at Li Xiuyuan’s throat. “Tell me, where is your sect master?”
Li Xiuyuan gritted his teeth. A trace of resolve flashed in his eyes: “Want to find the sect master? Get past me first!”
He suddenly slapped his chest, spitting out a mouthful of golden essence blood. The essence blood fell to the ground, transforming into a complex rune array.
“Holy Light Sacrifice!”
With Li Xiuyuan’s roar, the rune array suddenly burst into dazzling light. Countless golden chains drilled out from the array, wrapping towards Chen Ping.
These chains flickered with sacred runes. They were obviously some kind of forbidden technique.
“Stubborn fool.”
Chen Ping’s eyes turned cold. He swept the Dragon-Slaying Sword horizontally.
The sword aura interwoven with gold and black was like the scythe of the Grim Reaper. It instantly severed all the golden chains.
The remaining force of the sword aura did not diminish. It slashed straight towards Li Xiuyuan’s head.
