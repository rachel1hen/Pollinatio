“Boom!”
The instant the arrow feathers collided with the fireball, time seemed to freeze.
Immediately after, a destructive energy erupted. Golden light engulfed everything, and even space trembled slightly.
Everyone was stunned by this force, instinctively closing their eyes.
When the light dissipated, the scene in the arena made everyone gasp in shock.
Qin Lie knelt on one knee, a gruesome blood hole appearing on his chest. Blood gushed out, and his purple-gold armour shattered into several pieces.
He looked at the wound on his chest in disbelief, his eyes filled with terror.
Chen Ping was not much better off. The backlash from the God King Bow had shattered his meridians throughout his body. Blood kept spilling from the corners of his mouth, and his body swayed unsteadily.
“I… I actually lost?”
Qin Lie muttered to himself. Then a flash of madness appeared in his eyes. “No! I haven’t lost!”
He suddenly raised his head and looked at the people behind him. “What are you all standing there for? Get him! Kill him! Seize the divine artefact!”
Greed flashed in the blood-armoured cultivator’s eyes as he charged forward first. “The God King Bow is mine!”
You Wuxie was not willing to lag behind. Black energy swirled around him as he pounced towards Chen Ping. “Chen Ping, your physical body is mine!”
You Yue and You Wuji followed closely. Experts from various sects also made their moves. Everyone was drawn by the God King Bow and Chen Ping’s dragon clan bloodline; they had long forgotten the previous agreement.
“Despicable and shameless!”
Li Chunfeng shouted angrily. He drew his long sword and met the blood-armoured cultivator.
“Protect Mr. Chen!”
Nan Batian and Xiao Cui acted simultaneously. The cultivators from the Information Building formed a human wall, blocking the incoming enemies.
Mo Chen and Hu Mazi supported Chen Ping as they retreated. Ling Xue held her long sword and stood at the forefront, her eyes coldly fixed on the approaching You Yue.
“Little slut, die!”
A bone whip appeared in You Yue’s hand. It whipped towards Ling Xue with a whooshing sound.
“Get lost!” Ling Xue shouted angrily. Her long sword thrust out like a startling rainbow, forcing You Yue back.
The melee erupted instantly!
Li Chunfeng fought with the blood-armoured cultivator. Both were at the ninth grade of the Earth Immortal realm. Sword qi clashed with the blood-coloured light shield. Each exchange caused the heavens and earth to change colour.
Nan Batian wielded the Heaven-Opening Axe with unmatched bravery, forcefully holding off the siege of several Earth Immortal realm cultivators.
Xiao Cui moved nimbly. Her silver needles targeted the enemies’ vital points, complementing the others perfectly.
Although the Sword Sect disciples were weaker in strength, each one fought fearlessly to the death against the evil cultivators of the Evil Dao Hall. Screams and the clashing of weapons echoed endlessly.
Chen Ping leaned against the wall, watching the chaos before him with extreme anxiety in his heart.
He wanted to help, but he lacked even the strength to raise his hand. The backlash from the God King Bow was more severe than he had imagined.
This time, using the God King Bow had nearly exhausted the Dao pattern baleful qi in Chen Ping’s body.
“Chen Ping, how are you?” Hu Mazi asked anxiously while using talismans to fend off attacks.
“I’m fine…”
Chen Ping coughed up a mouthful of blood. A trace of despair flashed in his eyes. Could it be that he was really going to die here today?
“I’ll take you and escape. These people probably can’t hold out much longer.”
Hu Mazi wanted to take Chen Ping and flee!
But Chen Ping shook his head. These people were all fighting desperately against Qin Lie and the others to save him.
How could Chen Ping just leave them behind?
“Fire Qilin…”
Chen Ping shouted loudly.
A red light burst from the storage ring and landed on the ground.
The Fire Qilin, covered in red scales all over its body, opened its mouth and let out a tender roar.
Although the Fire Qilin had grown a lot, it was still a cub.
“This is… a Fire Qilin?” Mo Chen exclaimed in shock.
The little Fire Qilin seemed to sense Chen Ping’s crisis. A fierce glint flashed in its eyes, and it suddenly inhaled deeply.
“Roar!”
A deafening roar resounded. The little Qilin’s body grew at a visible speed. In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a gigantic beast several zhang tall. Its body burned with raging flames, emanating the aura of a divine beast.
