“Hall Master, the Seventh Hall Master reports that Chen Ping has left the Third Heaven. Chen Ping’s strength is unfathomable, and the Seventh Hall Master was no match for him. Moreover, Chen Ping has clashed with the Evil Path Hall, killing their members,” a maid reported softly.
The Fourth Hall Master turned, toying with a jade pendant, a hint of surprise in her eyes, “A Fifth Grade Loose Immortal defeating the Seventh Hall Master? This Chen Ping is an intriguing variable.”
The maid bowed, “The Seventh Hall Master also said he followed your orders, not fully falling out with Chen Ping, only testing him.”
“Well done.”
The Fourth Hall Master nodded, “The Divine Hall has long been plagued by stagnation. Those conservative old fogies only cling to tradition. If we can gain the aid of someone like him, the path to reform might be smoother.”
She paused, then said to the maid, “Yunxiu, go to the Fourth Heaven yourself. If the Evil Path Hall troubles Chen Ping, offer him some help, but don’t overly offend them.”
“Our Divine Hall, and the entire Divine Clan, have too many enemies already. We shouldn’t provoke a force like the Evil Path Hall. In the future, we must learn to keep a low profile. Acting superior without absolute strength only invites trouble.”
“Yes, Hall Master,” the maid, Yunxiu, replied.
The Fourth Hall Master added, “Find Chen Ping and tell him we bear no grudges. The Divine Hall is willing to turn conflict into friendship. If he needs help, the Fourth Hall will fully support him.”
Yunxiu’s eyes flickered, “Hall Master, what about the Third Hall Master…”
“Ignore him.”
The Fourth Hall Master’s tone turned cold, “If he wants to court death, I won’t stop him, but he won’t drag the entire Divine Hall down with him.”
Meanwhile, a different scene unfolded in the Third Hall Master’s palace.
Dressed in golden robes, the Third Hall Master’s face was grim. After hearing his subordinate’s report, he slammed the table, roaring, “Useless! Can’t even handle a Fifth Grade Loose Immortal? The Seventh Hall Master might as well step down!”
The trembling messenger below whispered, “Hall Master, the Seventh Hall Master is the Fourth Hall Master’s man. She only instructed him to test Chen Ping, so he likely didn’t go all out. Now that Chen Ping has left the Third Heaven, what should we do?”
The Third Hall Master took a deep breath, a ruthless glint in his eyes, “Chen Ping? Just a clown daring to challenge the Divine Hall’s authority!”
“Send my orders: have the Sixth Hall Master in the Sixth Heaven take people to hunt Chen Ping down at all costs. Kill him!”
“If Chen Ping leaves the Sixth Heaven alive, the Sixth Hall Master can give up his position!”
“Yes!” The messenger nodded and hurriedly retreated.
In the empty hall, the Third Hall Master sneered, “Fourth Hall Master, you want to recruit Chen Ping? How naive. Such a variable must be eliminated!”
“Our Divine Hall is the elite of the Divine Clan, inherently superior to those human cultivators. Yet you lower yourself. Don’t blame me for being ruthless!”
The Third and Fourth Hall Masters stood in opposition, each representing different factions within the Divine Hall.
However, with the Divine King’s Token in her possession, the Third Hall Master dared not move against the Fourth.
…
Fifth Heaven.
Outside a massive city called Sword Saint City, three figures approached slowly.
It was Chen Ping, Hu Mazi, and Nan Batian.
“This Sword Saint City is truly impressive!”
Hu Mazi gazed at the hundred-metre-high city walls, etched with countless sword-shaped runes radiating sword energy, and couldn’t help but exclaim.
Nan Batian nodded, “Sword Saint City is a renowned haven for sword cultivators in the Fifth Heaven. Every cultivator here excels in swordsmanship. The city is filled with experts, including no small number of Seventh Grade Earth Immortal sword cultivators.”
Chen Ping’s eyes scanned the walls, feeling the soaring sword momentum, a spark of interest in his gaze, “Oh? All sword cultivators? That’s intriguing.”
