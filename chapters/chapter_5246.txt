Hearing Qin Feng’s name, Ling Xue’s brows furrowed slightly, her tone tinged with displeasure, “The Divine Sword Manor holds considerable influence in the Fifth Heaven. They’ve always seen themselves as orthodox sword cultivators, considering our Sword Sect’s techniques unorthodox and looking down on us from the bottom of their hearts.”
She paused, then continued, “Especially Qin Feng. Relying on his decent talent and some fame among the younger generation in Sword Saint City, he constantly targets us Sword Sect disciples who ascended from the Third Heaven.
This time at the city gate, when we clashed with sword intent, he provoked me first, saying he’d show me what true swordsmanship is. I couldn’t stand it, so I took him on.”
Chen Ping nodded in understanding. No wonder their sword intent clash earlier was so intense; there was clearly longstanding resentment.
“So, between the Divine Sword Manor and your Sword Sect, who has more influence in Sword Saint City?” Chen Ping asked.
“It’s hard to say.”
Ling Xue shook her head, “The Divine Sword Manor has deep roots and many disciples; our Sword Sect may have fewer people, but we have plenty of senior experts. If it came down to it, neither could easily overpower the other.
That said, among the younger generation, they are indeed more prominent than us.”
As they spoke, they passed a sword shop, the sound of clanging metal echoing from within.
Ling Xue pointed at the shop, “Most sword cultivators in Sword Saint City forge their own weapons. The craftsmen here are skilled, and many people come to have their swords custom-made.”
Chen Ping glanced in the direction she indicated, seeing the shop filled with all kinds of swords, their cold glint marking them as exceptional.
“Besides that, Sword Saint City has dedicated sword platforms for sparring. Every day, plenty of people go there to compete, both to exchange sword techniques and to gain experience,” Ling Xue added. “Oh, and in a while, Sword Saint City will hold a swordsmanship tournament. Many renowned sword cultivators from the Fifth Heaven will attend. You might want to check it out.”
Chen Ping nodded, gaining a deeper understanding of Sword Saint City.
Ling Xue led Chen Ping and Hu Mazi through several streets, arriving at a quieter area.
The bustling energy of the city centre was gone, replaced by quaint buildings and the faint scent of grass and wood in the air.
Stopping before an unremarkable courtyard, Ling Xue turned to Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, “This is where my master lives. He’s a bit eccentric, so don’t speak out of turn when we’re inside.”
With that, she knocked on the door.
“Who’s there?” an aged voice called from within the courtyard.
“Master, it’s me, Ling Xue,” she replied.
“Come in.”
Ling Xue pushed open the door, leading Chen Ping and Hu Mazi inside.
The courtyard was filled with vegetable patches, where an old man in rough hemp clothing was tending to the plants, holding a hoe. He looked like an ordinary farmer, with no trace of a cultivator’s aura.
“Master, I’ve brought two friends to meet you,” Ling Xue said respectfully.
The old man turned, glancing at Chen Ping and Hu Mazi. His eyes were cloudy, yet they seemed to see right through people.
He chuckled, “Ling Xue, you lass, you’re always either practising your sword or practising your sword. Since when do you bring friends back?”
Ling Xue’s cheeks flushed slightly, “Master, this is Chen Ping. He knows our Sword Sect’s swordsmanship.”
At this, a glint flashed in the old man’s eyes. He studied Chen Ping closely, “Oh? Knows our Sword Sect’s swordsmanship? Young man, show me what you’ve got.”
Chen Ping hesitated. He didn’t want to draw too much attention, but this old man didn’t seem ordinary. Perhaps he could indeed learn something useful from him.
Taking a deep breath, Chen Ping channelled his spiritual energy, and the Dragon-Slaying Sword reappeared in his hand.
With no flashy moves, he simply swung a single, straightforward sword strike.
