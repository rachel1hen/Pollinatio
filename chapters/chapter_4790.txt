“Alright, you all take care in the Lawless Land, if anything comes up, I’ll let you know.”
Chen Ping stashed his immortal spirit stones and addressed the group!
“Mr. Chen, you need to be extra cautious, this is Huo family turf now, you killed that Huo Ming, so they’re definitely not letting it slide.”
“The only reason they haven’t moved yet is probably because they’re waiting for the Heaven Ladder to show up.”
The Tenth Hall Master warned Chen Ping!
“I know!” Chen Ping nodded!
“Chen Ping, if you run into danger and can’t get out, try to make it to the Dao Gate, once you’re there, even the Huo family wouldn’t dare act too wild.”
Yun Li stepped forward and said!
“Dao Gate? What’s that place? You never mentioned it before?”
Chen Ping asked, puzzled!
“The Dao Gate’s just a hangout for cultivators, when the Heaven Ladder appears, everyone gathers there, so it’s the liveliest spot around this time.”
“A lot of cultivators come to the Lawless Land not to climb the ladder, but to trade at the Dao Gate, it’s pretty much deserted otherwise.”
“The Dao Gate’s the only spot in the Lawless Land not run by the Huo family, it’s co-managed peacefully by various factions to keep the Huo family from using their home advantage to screw everyone else!”
Yun Li explained the Dao Gate to Chen Ping!
“One more thing, in the Lawless Land, Mr. Chen, don’t trust anyone, especially with your identity now, who knows how many are eyeing you like hawks.”
Xuan Bin chimed in!
“Brother-in-law, don’t get too wound up, when the Heaven Ladder opens, the Dao Gate’s partly managed by our Sun-Moon City too, my dad and Master Wuji will be there.”
Lin Kefan patted Chen Ping’s shoulder, easing his nerves!
As a major power in the Celestial Human Realm, Sun-Moon City naturally had a stake in the Dao Gate!
“Got it, I understand!”
Chen Ping flashed a slight smile, then vanished in a blur!
Crossing the vast grey zone, Chen Ping’s view suddenly opened wide!
Towering, majestic mountains, lush green trees, sprawling grasslands, and herds of cattle and sheep…
Staring at this breathtaking scene, Chen Ping froze!
This is the Lawless Land?
He was dumbfounded, from the Tenth Hall Master’s rundown, this place was supposed to be a wasteland!
No spiritual energy, no resources at all…
Then it hit him, his eyes lit up, and he slapped his forehead, “Holy crap, so this is what the Lawless Land’s like…”
Chen Ping got it, the Lawless Land wasn’t barren in the usual sense, it just lacked spiritual energy and cultivation resources, making it worthless to Celestial Human Realm cultivators!
But for regular folks, for the secular world, this was paradise!
Clear mountains, pristine waters, animals roaming everywhere!
Normal animals, not beast clans, no chance of them turning human!
“Amazing, finally back to feeling like a regular person…”
Chen Ping dropped from midair onto the grass, rolling around in sheer excitement!
The fresh air filled his lungs, a wave of pure comfort washing over him!
“Such a gorgeous place, and in the eyes of these Celestial Human Realm folks, it’s just the Lawless Land…”
Chen Ping felt a pang of emotion.
If he could, he’d love to bring all the women in his life here, living a simple, quiet life forever!
But he knew that was a pipe dream, his current path wouldn’t let him settle down!
“Fellow Daoist, first time here?”
A voice suddenly sounded beside Chen Ping!
His body jolted, springing up instantly, he’d been so caught up in the moment he hadn’t even noticed someone approaching!
