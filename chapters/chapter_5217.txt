The barbs on the long whip were shattered by the sword’s energy, producing a crisp “crackling” sound. The leading black-robed figure felt a tremendous force surge through, numbing their arm, the whip nearly slipping from their grasp.
“What kind of power is this?”
A flicker of shock passed through the black-robed figure’s eyes. They could sense a pure, domineering aura within Chen Ping’s spiritual energy, capable of suppressing their demonic qi.
In the moment of their distraction, Chen Ping seized the opportunity. His figure shot forward like an arrow released from a bow, the Dragon-Slaying Sword carrying an unstoppable momentum, aimed directly at the black-robed figure on the right.
Caught off guard, the figure on the right hurriedly manipulated vines to block, but the sword’s energy sliced through them instantly. The blade’s momentum continued, heading straight for their throat.
“Watch out!”
The leading black-robed figure shouted in alarm, quickly retracting the whip to assist.
Chen Ping, seeing this, curled his lips into a cold smile. This was exactly the reaction he wanted.
He abruptly changed his move. The Dragon-Slaying Sword swept outwards, not targeting the figure on the right but slashing towards the cluster of vines on the ground.
Golden sword energy erupted like a thunderclap, instantly severing all the vines on the ground and stirring up a cloud of dust.
Using the dust as cover, Chen Ping grabbed Hu Mazi, leapt down from the ancient tree, and fled towards the depths of the dense forest.
“Think you can escape?”
The leading black-robed figure roared in anger, leading the other two in hot pursuit.
The chase unfolded in the forest, a thrilling game of cat and mouse.
Chen Ping constantly changed direction, weaving through paths to shake off his pursuers, but the black-robed figures were fast, relentlessly staying on his trail.
Under Chen Ping’s protection, Hu Mazi finally recovered some spiritual energy. He pulled several talisman papers from his robes, quickly drawing wind talismans. “Chen Ping, let me help you!”
He attached the wind talismans to both of them. The talismans turned into a breeze, boosting their speed significantly.
“Well done!”
Chen Ping’s spirits lifted, his speed increasing further, gradually widening the gap between them and the black-robed figures.
However, at that moment, a disturbance came from the forest ahead. The ground trembled violently, as if something massive was approaching.
“Not good!”
Chen Ping’s expression changed. He could sense a powerful demonic aura rapidly closing in, its strength no less than that of the Black Wind Demon’s master they had encountered before.
He quickly altered his course to avoid the demonic aura, but it was too late.
A gigantic black bear, ten zhang tall, emerged from the forest, blocking their path.
The bear’s eyes glowed red, its roars indicating it had been roused by the earlier battle.
“It’s a Black Demon Bear!”
Hu Mazi’s face paled as he recognised the beast. “Ancient texts say the Black Demon Bear is one of the overlords of Jiupan Mountain’s outer regions, with strength comparable to a Transformation Stage cultivator, and an extremely volatile temper!”
Chen Ping’s heart sank. With the Black Demon Bear ahead and the black-robed figures pursuing from behind, they were truly trapped.
The Black Demon Bear spotted Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, a ferocious glint in its eyes. Roaring, it charged towards them, its massive paw swinging with earth-shattering force.
Chen Ping didn’t dare meet it head-on, quickly dodging with Hu Mazi in tow.
The bear’s paw struck the ground with a deafening boom, creating a massive crater as stones flew in all directions.
“This is trouble.”
Chen Ping glanced at the enraged Black Demon Bear and then at the approaching black-robed figures, his brows furrowing. “We need to find a way to shake them off.”
Hu Mazi’s eyes suddenly lit up. “I have an idea! Chen Ping, hold them off. I’ll try to lure the Black Demon Bear away with a talisman!”
“Are you sure?” Chen Ping asked.
“I think so!”
Hu Mazi nodded. “My ancestor’s teachings mention that the Black Demon Bear fears a herb called ‘Pure Heart Grass.’ I can use a talisman to mimic its scent and draw it away.”
