The clash of metal rang out like thunder as Lin Chong’s sword-like fingers collided with the spear, sparks flying in all directions.
The ground beneath their feet collapsed with a roar, and within a hundred-li radius, the forests and mountains crumbled to dust under the shockwaves of their energy.
“Stubborn fool!”
Lin Chong suddenly shifted his fingers into a palm, and a sun-and-moon seal in his hand erupted with blinding light.
Behind him, the crimson-gold sun and silvery moon intertwined and spun, forming a Yin-Yang Taiji diagram. The terrifying energy fluctuations caused the unicorn-horned middle-aged man’s bones to crackle like popping beans.
Chen Ping was still recovering rapidly, absorbing resources from his storage ring as if they cost nothing!
He had to restore himself as quickly as possible, or danger might strike. After all, that Ming Shao hadn’t made a move yet, and who knew if the guy could still summon reinforcements!
At the same time, Chen Ping kept a close eye on Lin Chong. The strength Lin Chong unleashed far exceeded his expectations!
To be the third-ranked power in the Celestial Realm, Sun-Moon City was indeed extraordinary!
Thankfully, Sun-Moon City was a branch of the Heavenly Dragon Hall, or Chen Ping wouldn’t know how to handle the situation at hand!
“Sun and Moon Shine Together, Suppress!”
With Lin Chong’s thunderous shout, the Yin-Yang Taiji diagram crashed down.
The unicorn-horned man let out a desperate roar as the black mist around him was ground to nothing. The resentful spirits on the blood-red spear wailed in agony as they were scorched by the yang flames.
Just as the Taiji diagram was about to crush him, the ground suddenly split open into a gaping abyss. Countless ghastly white skeletal hands burst forth from the earth, forcibly holding back the suppression of the Yin-Yang Taiji diagram.
“Trying to escape?”
Lin Chong sneered, a faint golden light shooting from his fingertip.
Though the golden light seemed weak, it transformed into thousands of sword threads upon hitting the ground, instantly shredding all the skeletal hands within a hundred-zhang radius into dust.
The unicorn-horned man seized the chance to plunge into the abyss, but Lin Chong’s figure appeared like a phantom at the edge of the chasm.
“Playing earth escape in front of this Emperor?”
Lin Chong pressed his hand to the abyss’s edge, and terrifying yang flames surged along the earth’s veins.
The entire Wuwang Land trembled violently. A blood-curdling scream echoed from deep underground, followed by a charred figure blasting out of the ground like a cannonball.
“Emperor Lin, your reputation is well-deserved…”
The unicorn-horned man was engulfed in flames, his horn snapped in half, his single eye glaring at Lin Chong.
Suddenly, he burst into maniacal laughter. “But do you think this is over?”
Before his words fully landed, he reached for his own heart with his bare hand.
In Lin Chong’s widening eyes, the man’s body swelled like a balloon, the blood-red patterns on his horn glowing with blinding crimson light.
“Not good! He’s going to self-destruct!”
Chen Ping shot to his feet, but it was too late to stop him.
The unicorn-horned man’s entire body exploded with a deafening boom, countless blood-red specks scattering like fireflies. The moment they touched the ground, they morphed into grotesque ghostly faces.
“Jie jie jie…”
“Emperor Lin, enjoy the curse of the Four Nether Prefectures!”
The swarm of ghostly faces lunged at Lin Chong, but they screeched upon nearing three zhang of his body.
A sun-and-moon seal appeared at Lin Chong’s brow, and the instant the ghostly faces touched the yang flames, most turned to green smoke. Only a scant few breached the defence, latching onto his arm.
“Damn it!”
Lin Chong’s expression shifted as ice crystals instantly formed on his infected right arm.
Seeing this, Chen Ping crushed a jade talisman without hesitation. Supreme flames instantly flooded the sky, incinerating the remaining ghostly faces to ash.
“Emperor Lin, I’ll save you…”
Though Chen Ping hadn’t fully recovered, he had no choice but to step in and help Lin Chong now!
“Mr. Chen, no need!”
Lin Chong abruptly sliced off the corrupted sleeve with his fingers, revealing steely muscles underneath.
The sun-and-moon seal spread from his brow to his entire right arm, and the black patterns melted away like snow under the searing yang flames.
“These clowns from the Four Nether Prefectures really think this Emperor’s Sun-Moon Golden Rainbow Technique is just for show?”
He turned to Chen Ping. “Mr. Chen, focus on recuperating. The aftershocks here haven’t fully settled.”
Chen Ping was about to speak when the ground suddenly trembled again.
