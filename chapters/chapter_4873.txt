“I, Shen Zhiyan, pay my respects to Mr. Chen…”
The scholar dropped to one knee, fully submitting to Chen Ping!
“Get up!” Chen Ping waved a hand!
After Shen Zhiyan stood, he asked Chen Ping, “Mr. Chen, are you planning to head to the next level?”
“Of course!” Chen Ping nodded!
“Mr. Chen, the guardian of the fourth level isn’t easy to deal with, and the fourth-level world is teeming with experts. If you’re going there, you’d better proceed with caution!”
Shen Zhiyan advised Chen Ping!
“If I break his seal for him, would he still fight me?”
Chen Ping smiled faintly!
But Shen Zhiyan shook his head, “The fourth-level guardian isn’t imprisoned by someone else, he’s self-imprisoned, dedicating himself to cultivation. So relying on breaking a seal to grant him freedom won’t work.”
“Self-imprisoned for cultivation? That sounds like he’s got a screw loose, doesn’t it?”
Chen Ping found it bizarre upon hearing this. Who in their right mind would lock themselves up?
“That’s why I’m advising you to be careful, Mr. Chen. People like that usually aren’t quite right in the head, unpredictable and moody!” Shen Zhiyan said!
Chen Ping fell silent for a moment before asking, “Is there any way to skip the fourth level and go straight to the fifth?”
“No way, the Ladder to Heaven has to be climbed step by step!”
Shen Zhiyan shook his head!
“Whatever, I’ll deal with whatever comes my way. Let’s get to the fifth level and figure it out then!”
“But your strength, how did it get suppressed so much? You’d better find a way to recover, or with your current power, you’ll get yourself killed in the Celestial Realm!”
With that, Chen Ping tossed a storage pouch to Shen Zhiyan, filled with immortal spirit stones!
After the fierce battle with Ming Shao, though Chen Ping’s side had lost many, the spoils were plentiful. The people from the Qian Gate, Huo family, and Four Nether Palaces had carried a ton of resources!
With a bit of tidying up, Chen Ping had collected a million immortal spirit stones!
“Mr. Chen, I’m not as weak as you think. Just now, for some reason, my strength got suddenly suppressed!”
“If we fought now, you might not be my match.”
Shen Zhiyan said!
“No way, I sent you flying with one punch!” Chen Ping didn’t believe it!
Suddenly, Shen Zhiyan threw a punch, landing it square on Chen Ping, sending him flying!
Caught off guard, Chen Ping soared out of the palace entrance, crashing heavily to the ground, his insides churning in agony!
“Damn it, why didn’t you say anything before sneaking an attack like that?”
Chen Ping frowned as he grumbled!
“It’s called striking first, you’ve only got yourself to blame for not being cautious enough!”
Shen Zhiyan smirked!
“Fine, let’s go again…”
Chen Ping vanished in a flash of golden light, reappearing in front of Shen Zhiyan in the blink of an eye!
With a swing of his Dragon-Slaying Sword, a terrifying sword intent enveloped Shen Zhiyan’s surroundings!
Under normal circumstances, an attack like this would’ve sent Shen Zhiyan flying!
But this time, a book suddenly appeared in Shen Zhiyan’s hand. As its pages flipped, beams of light shot out like razor-sharp blades!
Chen Ping’s sword intent shattered instantly, and countless light-blades surged toward him!
Chen Ping retreated rapidly, the Indestructible Golden Body on him ringing with bang after bang!
By the time he backed out of the palace, he saw cracks spiderwebbing across his Indestructible Golden Body!
Clearly, Shen Zhiyan was now several times stronger than before!
Shen Zhiyan and Li Chunfeng stepped out of the palace!
“Mr. Chen, are you alright?” Shen Zhiyan asked!
“Senior, when I challenged you earlier, were you holding back?”
Chen Ping couldn’t believe how much Shen Zhiyan’s strength had changed in such a short time!
“I nearly got beaten to death by you, covered in wounds, you think I was holding back?”
Shen Zhiyan looked helpless. His suppression had just lifted, it wasn’t about going easy!
Chen Ping still didn’t know that the master of the Ladder to Heaven was the one letting him off easy!
