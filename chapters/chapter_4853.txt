The middle-aged man could see that Chen Ping had reached the end of his strength, a faint smile curling at the corner of his mouth.
“You may have the Divine King Bow, but with your current ability, I’m afraid you can’t even draw it, can you?”
The middle-aged man sneered.
Though Chen Ping indeed couldn’t draw the Divine King Bow at this moment, there wasn’t the slightest trace of fear on his face.
In this final moment, he knew he still had the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord as a fallback!
And if the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord didn’t step in, there was still Master Shi!
“Even without the Divine King Bow, you can’t kill me,” Chen Ping said with a faint smile.
“Is that so? Let’s find out…”
With that, the middle-aged man’s body erupted with a surge of murderous aura, charging straight towards Chen Ping!
“Mr. Chen, a petty scoundrel like this is something I can handle!”
A voice rang out, and Lin Chong’s figure appeared!
“What about that Red Claw old ghost?” Chen Ping asked, looking at Lin Chong in surprise.
“Dead!”
Lin Chong casually waved his hand, and a head flew out—it was none other than the Red Claw elder!
“As the堂堂 Emperor of Sun-Moon City, if I couldn’t even slay a lowly minion from the Four Nether Prefectures, how could Sun-Moon City still claim to be the third greatest power in the Celestial Realm?”
After speaking, Lin Chong turned to the unicorn-horned middle-aged man and thrust his palm forward, instantly dispersing the rolling murderous aura!
Seeing this, Chen Ping seized the opportunity to rest and recover.
This battle had truly drained him. For someone at the fourth rank of the Great Ascension Realm to hold his own in a chaotic fight among cultivators at the Immortal Transformation Realm was already an impressive feat!
“Emperor Lin, you’ve just been through a great battle. You’re no match for me!” the unicorn-horned middle-aged man declared.
“Hmph, didn’t you just fight a battle too? Whether I’m a match for you, we’ll only know after we try!”
Lin Chong sneered coldly!
“Boom—!”
As he spoke, Lin Chong brought his fingers together like a sword, and in an instant, the heavens and earth lost their colour.
A terrifying pressure poured down like a celestial river, and within a hundred-zhang radius, the void rippled with fine cracks.
Before the golden sword beam even reached the middle-aged man, the boiling murderous aura around him had already been suppressed and scattered by a third.
“The Sun-Moon Golden Rainbow Technique?”
The middle-aged man’s pupils shrank, and the black mist coiling around his unicorn horn suddenly surged. His once-solid form morphed into a mass of flowing black flames.
These eerie flames twisted in the void, forming a ferocious ghostly face that opened its maw to devour the righteous energy within Lin Chong’s sword beam.
“The Black Fiend Heart-Devouring Flame of the Four Nether Prefectures?”
Lin Chong sneered, “You dare flaunt such a petty trick before this Emperor!”
His left hand swiftly shifted through a series of seals, and the once-dazzling golden sword beam suddenly took on a tinge of crimson.
A blazing golden-red sun abruptly rose between heaven and earth, its scorching yang flames cascading down like a waterfall.
The black flames let out a piercing shriek under the overwhelming, unyielding yang energy, and the ghostly face was instantly vaporised into nothingness.
“Ah!”
The middle-aged man reappeared, his right arm’s scales reduced to charred ash, his eyes filled with wariness.
With a cold expression, he took a deep breath and slowly opened his palm.
Boom!
Between heaven and earth, a pitch-black spear materialised in his hand!
“The Blood Soul Spear? Things just got interesting. Looks like he’s been pushed to his limit!”
Seeing the spear in the middle-aged man’s hand, Ming Shao smirked faintly.
Suddenly, the middle-aged man bit the tip of his tongue, spitting a mouthful of essence blood onto his horn. The black spear, covered in barbs, began to glow with blood-red patterns, faintly emitting the wails of countless resentful spirits.
“Blood Soul Sacrifice?”
A grave look crossed Lin Chong’s face. “That’s a forbidden technique of the Four Nether Prefectures. It can temporarily boost one’s cultivation by thirty percent, but at the cost of a hundred years of lifespan!”
Before his words had fully landed, the middle-aged man had already transformed into a streak of blood-red light, charging forward.
As the spear swept through the air, the void split open with several zhang-long fissures. Countless blood-red chains burst forth from the cracks, reeking of decay as they lashed towards Lin Chong.
“Sun-Moon Cycle, Break!”
Lin Chong’s hands formed a complex series of seals, and nine illusory Golden Crows materialised behind him.
A blazing field of light formed an absolute domain, evaporating the blood-red chains into wisps of blood mist before they could even reach him. Meanwhile, the spear itself darted forward like a venomous snake, aiming straight for Lin Chong’s throat.
