“What the hell did you just say? Looking to die, huh?”
Wenshi’s brows furrowed, ready to throw down with Young Master Ming!
“Brother!” Wenqing grabbed her brother’s arm, “Before Dad went into seclusion, he told us not to stir up trouble.”
Wenshi’s face flushed red with anger, but he just shot Young Master Ming a glare and stormed off!
Watching the siblings leave, Young Master Ming smirked with disdain, then sauntered into a nearby tavern!
Seeing him enter, the tavern staff immediately jumped to serve him like royalty!
This Young Master Ming’s notorious reputation preceded him.
He sipped his wine delicately, while the eight Transcendent Immortal cultivators stood ramrod straight behind him!
That kind of swagger was off the charts!
Suddenly, a terrifying aura slowly enveloped the tavern, and an old man with wild red hair and a menacing face shuffled in!
“Young Master Ming, the Palace Lord was worried you might be in danger, so he sent this old servant to accompany you!”
The old man bowed respectfully before Young Master Ming!
“Red-Haired Ghost, just say you’re here to babysit me, why all the extra nonsense?”
“With my strength, plus my eight Yin cultivators behind me, who could possibly put me in danger?”
Young Master Ming snorted coldly!
The red-haired old man lowered his head, staying silent.
“Go find out about that Chen Ping guy, see if he’s got any serious backing, if it’s just Sun Moon City, that’s too boring, they’re too weak, not worth my time!”
Young Master Ming ordered the red-haired old man!
“Yes, sir!” With that, the old man’s figure vanished in an instant!
“I really hope this Chen Ping’s got some badass support, that’d make things interesting, otherwise this trip’s a snooze.”
Young Master Ming mused, swirling his wine glass!
…
Dao Sect, Sun Moon City Base!
Chen Ping was quietly cultivating, with no one bothering him, he could finally focus on training, hoping to climb an extra tier when the Heaven-Climbing Ladder descended!
“Chen Ping, stop practicing, that Young Master Ming from the Four Nether Palaces is here, and he’s crazy arrogant, even more than you!”
Lin Kefan burst into Chen Ping’s room, shouting!
“So he’s arrogant, what’s that got to do with me?” Chen Ping asked!
“So he’s arrogant, what’s that got to do with me?” Chen Ping repeated!
“This Young Master Ming heard you’re a big shot, he’s having people dig into you, probably planning to come after you.”
Lin Kefan’s face was tense with worry!
“No big deal, your dad and Limitless Daoist are almost here, right?”
Chen Ping said!
“Even if my dad and Limitless Daoist show up, they might not be able to do much, this Young Master Ming’s got eight Transcendent Immortal goons with him.”
“And that Red-Haired Ghost is here too, guy’s no slouch, supposedly hit fifth-grade Transcendent Immortal already.”
Lin Kefan explained to Chen Ping!
“Eight Transcendent Immortals? And a fifth-grade one too?” Chen Ping was genuinely shocked!
How the hell was the Four Nether Palaces this stacked, were Transcendent Immortals growing on trees over there?
“So what now? Should I go grovel to this Young Master Ming, apologise, and admit he’s tougher than me?”
Chen Ping asked!
“If groveling worked, he wouldn’t be this cocky, once he’s got you in his sights, apologies probably won’t cut it.”
Lin Kefan frowned!
“If apologies won’t do, then we fight, beat him into submission, problem solved…”
Chen Ping grinned faintly, then sent his consciousness inward, asking the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord, “Senior, a fifth-grade Transcendent Immortal, can you handle that?”
“Fifth-grade Transcendent Immortal? That’s nothing, I could crush him with one finger, as long as your body can take it, even a real immortal, I’d slap him dead in one hit.”
Crimson Cloud Demon Lord boasted boldly!
“Perfect, with you around, what’s there to fear? If he comes for me, I’ll take him out!”
Chen Ping laughed!
“Chen Ping, you’re still laughing? If it comes to it, just ditch Wuwang Land, skip the Heaven-Climbing Ladder, wait a hundred years, no biggie.”
Lin Kefan suggested!
“Chill, if that Young Master Ming dares mess with me, I’ll beat the crap out of him!”
Chen Ping clapped Lin Kefan on the shoulder!
He was pretty fond of this brother-in-law, the guy genuinely had his back!
