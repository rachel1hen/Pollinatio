Watching Li Chunfeng’s departing figure, Chen Ping felt a mix of emotions in his heart.
“Senior Brother Chen Ping, are you alright?” Ling Xue walked to his side and looked at him with concern.
“I’m fine.” Chen Ping shook his head and looked towards Mo Chen, who was being helped up by the disciples. “Master, how do you feel?”
Mo Chen waved his hand; his face was still pale. “These old bones can still hold up. It’s just… Qin Lie will never let this go. I’m afraid we’re in for big trouble.”
Hu Mazi was also deeply worried. “That old thing has been operating in the Fifth Heaven for many years, with connections everywhere. If he really unites the major sects against us, even with City Lord Li protecting us, it might be hard to withstand.”
Chen Ping remained silent. He knew this was just the calm before the storm. Qin Lie’s revenge would come sooner or later, and it would be even more fierce.
At this time, Qin Lie left with his people; his face was so gloomy that it could drip water.
In the carriage, Qin Feng, with both arms severed and cultivation abolished, slumped like mud; his eyes held nothing but venom and lifelessness.
“Father, I want to kill him! I want Chen Ping torn to pieces!”
Qin Feng’s hoarse roar was harsh and unpleasant; the scabs at the severed ends cracked again due to agitation.
Qin Lie suddenly slapped the carriage wall; the compartment instantly dented. “Rest assured. As your father, I will definitely make him beg for life but unable to live, beg for death but unable to die!”
A trace of ruthlessness flashed in his eyes. He had originally thought that with the help of the Zhang responsible and the various sects, victory was assured. But he did not expect Li Chunfeng to protect Chen Ping so much.
The pressure of the Earth Immortal Realm ninth stage was like a sword hanging overhead. As long as Li Chunfeng was in Sword Saint City for a day, it would be hard for him to have a chance of winning.
“Chen Ping…” Qin Lie gnashed his teeth. “Do you really think hiding in Sword Saint City means you can rest easy?”
Qin Lie decided to continue seeking helpers. Their Divine Sword Manor was famous for sword forging. As long as he was willing to offer benefits, he refused to believe he could not find people to help.
Moreover, Qin Lie also knew that Chen Ping had conflicts with the Divine Hall. Back then, the Sixth Hall Master of the Divine Hall had even sought out Chen Ping!
So, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Qin Lie decided to go to the Sixth Heaven to find the Sixth Hall Master!
Three days later, an inconspicuous black carriage drove out of Divine Sword Manor and sped all the way towards the northwest.
Inside the carriage, Qin Lie gazed at the scenery flashing by outside the window; in his hand, he fondled a black short sword engraved with strange runes.
This was forged by the ancestors of Divine Sword Manor in his early years. It was made from ten-thousand-year profound iron, with runes engraved on it.
Qin Lie planned to use this short sword to invite the Sixth Hall Master to deal with Chen Ping together!
Sixth Heaven
Amid the mist-shrouded mountains, a palace entirely built from black crystal stone floated in mid-air; the six blood-red orbs on the palace roof emitted a heart-palpitating aura.
Qin Lie stood on the cold jade steps, holding the black short sword high. “Qin Lie of Divine Sword Manor requests an audience with the Hall Master!”
Qin Lie did not dare to闯入 the Sixth Hall rashly. After all, behind the Sixth Hall was the Divine Hall!
And behind the Divine Hall was the entire Divine Clan. No matter how powerful Divine Sword Manor was, it could not provoke the entire Divine Clan.
Qin Lie shouted twice; inside the hall, there was dead silence, with only the candle flames flickering in the breeze.
After half a stick of incense, a hoarse voice like rusty iron scraping rang out. “Manor Lord Qin of Divine Sword Manor, what brings you to my Sixth Hall?”
Qin Lie trembled all over; cold sweat seeped from his forehead. “I am willing to offer the supreme treasured sword of Divine Sword Manor, only begging the Sixth Hall Master to take action and slay one person!”
“Oh?”
The voice carried a hint of amusement. “Who is worth such expense from you?”
“Chen Ping!” Qin Lie said calmly!
Upon hearing the two words Chen Ping, the Sixth Hall Master suddenly stood up. He had long wanted to kill Chen Ping, but unfortunately, the Fourth Hall Master had sent Yun Xiu to intervene and directly threatened him, preventing him from killing Chen Ping. Only then did the Sixth Hall Master have no way.
But if he did not kill Chen Ping, he had no way to report to the Third Hall Master. This made the Sixth Hall Master very troubled.
Now, Qin Lie had come knocking just in time. The Sixth Hall Master could go with the flow and also obtain the treasured sword!
