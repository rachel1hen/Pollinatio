Chen Ping’s eyes sharpened: “You know quite a lot.”
“Would the Holy Light Sect be unaware of major events in the Fifth Heaven?”
Wang Shengguang’s smile gradually turned sinister. “You killed Zhao Jingfeng in Sword Saint City and destroyed the Ten Thousand Poisons Valley. Such a big commotion could not be concealed even if one tried.”
“It’s just a pity that you should not have come to my Holy Light Sect under any circumstances.”
“Oh?” Chen Ping’s lips curled into a cold sneer. “Do you think you can keep me here?”
“Whether I can or not, we shall see after trying.”
Wang Shengguang’s eyes erupted with intense fighting spirit. “If I can use your divine dragon power and murderous aura for myself, perhaps I can break through to the ninth grade of the Earth Immortal realm and reach the legendary Human Immortal realm!”
He suddenly slapped the table in front of him. The table instantly turned to powder.
“Holy Light Great Method, Ten Thousand Swords Return to the Sect!”
With Wang Shengguang’s roar, all the decorations in the Holy Light Hall, including those two angel statues, turned into golden long swords, suspended in the air.
The densely packed long swords blotted out the sky. There were at least ten thousand of them. Each sword flickered with sacred runes, emitting a heart-palpitating pressure.
“This is my Holy Light Sect’s sect-suppressing treasure, the ‘Ten Thousand Holy Sword Domain’,” Wang Shengguang said with a cruel smile on his face. “Back then, the clan leader of the Hu clan died under this move. Today, I will let you taste the same fate!”
“Ten thousand swords, fire!”
At Wang Shengguang’s command, the ten thousand golden long swords buzzed simultaneously. Like a summoned swarm of bees, they shot towards Chen Ping.
The golden sword rain covered the sky, enveloping the entire Holy Light Hall. The air was filled with a sacred yet destructive aura.
Chen Ping’s expression was grave. He could feel that these golden long swords contained powerful sacred power, far stronger than Li Xiuyuan’s holy light sword technique by more than one level.
But he showed no fear at all. Instead, a trace of excitement flashed in his eyes.
“Bring it on!”
Chen Ping let out a long howl. The spiritual power and murderous aura in his body surged wildly. The Dragon-Slaying Sword erupted with unprecedented light.
The ten thousand golden long swords poured down like a torrential rain. The sacred runes on the swords burned with sizzling sounds in the air. Wherever they passed, even space rippled with fine wrinkles.
Wang Shengguang sat behind the sky-filling sword rain. His purple robe fluttered. His eyes were full of a cold smile of assured victory.
This Ten Thousand Holy Sword Domain was the Holy Light Sect’s forbidden technique passed down for ten thousand years. Back then, the Hu clan’s leader had exhausted himself to death under this move. He did not believe a Loose Immortal realm cultivator could defy fate.
Yet Chen Ping smiled at the moment the sword rain approached.
That smile held no fear, only the exhilaration of meeting a worthy opponent.
He suddenly stepped forward. The dragon essence and murderous aura in his body surged like boiling magma. The gold-black light on the Dragon-Slaying Sword suddenly exploded, forming a rotating vortex around him.
“Watch this!”
With a low shout, countless fine sword qi suddenly shot out from the vortex. These sword qi did not go straight; instead, they twisted and coiled as if alive, weaving into a huge black-gold net in mid-air.
The first wave of golden long swords collided with the net, producing dense clanging sounds. The exploding lights from the runes bloomed like fireworks, but they were firmly caught by the net, unable to advance an inch.
“Interesting.”
Wang Shengguang raised an eyebrow. His fingertip moved slightly. The sky-filling sword rain suddenly changed trajectory, converging like a tide towards one point.
In an instant, it condensed into a giant sword dozens of zhang long. Liquid-like golden light flowed on the blade, as if it were about to split heaven and earth in two.
“Holy Light Judgment!”
The giant sword descended with majestic heavenly might, tearing the air in half and forming a visible vacuum zone.
The white jade floor tiles under Chen Ping’s feet cracked instantly. Countless cracks spread like a spider web. The entire Holy Light Hall trembled violently under this pressure.
