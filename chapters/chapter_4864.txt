Anyone enveloped by these vengeful spirits would have their soul corroded, ultimately becoming just another resentful wraith within the Death Soul Fist!
With this single punch, the Guardian unleashed a million vengeful spirits, a testament to how many lives he had claimed with it!
Facing this punch, Chen Ping’s expression grew solemn, his face darkening!
He wanted to use the Heart-Calming Technique to absorb and refine these spirits, but with so many, it would take time—time his opponent would never grant him!
Gripping the Dragon-Slaying Sword, Chen Ping intended to cleave a gap with one swing and escape the Death Soul Fist’s reach!
But before he could act, the storage ring on his hand suddenly trembled, and out dashed the Little Heaven-Devouring Beast!
Confronted with a million vengeful spirits, the beast’s eyes gleamed!
Then, it opened its massive maw wide!
The million spirits were sucked straight into the Little Heaven-Devouring Beast’s belly, its mouth like a vortex. The spirits tried to flee, but they were helplessly drawn in!
Seeing this, the Guardian was stunned!
He had no idea what this bizarre, four-legged creature was!
In an instant, it had devoured his million vengeful spirits, and the world returned to normal!
Everyone stared, frozen in place.
Under their gazes, the Little Heaven-Devouring Beast licked its lips before slipping back into Chen Ping’s storage ring!
Seeing the beast retreat, Chen Ping burst into laughter, then said to the Guardian, “My little pet was starving, thanks for the meal!”
The crowd was utterly baffled at his words!
The Guardian, staring at his vanished million spirits, began to cry!
“Those were the million vengeful spirits I spent my life cultivating, you owe me…”
The Guardian wept bitterly, his life’s work devoured in one gulp by a strange little pet!
Watching this towering figure cry, Chen Ping was momentarily taken aback!
After sobbing for a while, the Guardian wiped his tears and glared fiercely at Chen Ping, “Kid, you wait, I’ll remember you!”
With that, he turned to leave!
“Guardian, why are you going?”
Qian Xiaohan hurriedly shouted!
“My million spirits are gone, what more can I do? I only promised to guard your Qian Gate for three thousand years, not to die for it!”
The Guardian replied, looking at Qian Xiaohan!
“Guardian, but this Chen Ping wants to wipe out our Qian Gate, you have to protect us!”
Qian Xiaohan pleaded!
The Guardian glanced at Qian Xiaohan, then turned to Chen Ping, “Little friend, give me some face, don’t hold a grudge against Qian Gate, spare them!”
This Guardian was now pleading with Chen Ping, appealing to his sense of honour!
“Qian Gate must fall…”
Chen Ping shook his head!
From the moment Qian Gate opposed him, aligning with Ming Shao, their doom was sealed!
“Damn it, can’t you give me some face? Must I fight you?”
The Guardian roared in fury!
“Go ahead and try!” Chen Ping replied calmly, utterly fearless!
“Kid, think you’re tough, huh?”
The Guardian’s face darkened, and he swung a fist!
Though devoid of the million spirits, the sheer force of this punch shook the void and darkened the skies!
“Don’t fear, son-in-law, your father-in-law’s here…”
With a loud shout, a sword beam flashed, blocking the punch’s power!
“Father?” Hua Yueying cried out, seeing the newcomer!
It was the Northern Domain Lord, looking every bit the sage with an air of immortality, wielding a dark, mysterious iron sword!
“Old Bei, since when did Chen become your son-in-law?”
“And you, old man, never mentioned having a daughter!”
Lin Chong, spotting the Northern Domain Lord, frowned and asked!
Chen Ping was with Lin Keting, so when did he get involved with the Northern Domain Lord’s daughter?
