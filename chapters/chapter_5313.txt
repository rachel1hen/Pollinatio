“Come in…”
The Sixth Hall Master spoke, allowing Qin Lie to enter!
With a wave of his hand from the Sixth Hall Master, Qin Lie tossed the short sword in his hand over. The Sixth Hall Master looked at the short sword, unable to put it down!
“Good. I can help you. However, that Chen Ping also has quite a few helpers by his side. You’d better find more people.”
The Sixth Hall Master said!
Qin Lie nodded. “Thank you, Hall Master. I will find others!”
“En!” The Sixth Hall Master grunted in affirmation and then waved his hand!
A moment later, three cultivators clad in blood-red armour walked out from inside the hall. The leader had an expressionless face; his aura had surprisingly reached the early stage of Earth Immortal Realm ninth grade, not inferior to Li Chunfeng.
“These are three Divine Clan Blood Guards sent by our Third Hall Master. Let the three of them help you. They will surely kill that Chen Ping.”
The Sixth Hall Master’s words made Qin Lie overjoyed!
Three Earth Immortal Realm ninth-grade cultivators at once. Now he would not need to fear that Li Chunfeng at all!
“Follow our lead. Do not act recklessly.”
The leading blood-armoured cultivator’s voice was ice-cold. He turned and walked towards the outside of the hall.
Qin Lie hurriedly followed. The stone hanging in his heart finally settled.
With the Sixth Hall of the Divine Hall taking action, even if Li Chunfeng personally intervened, Chen Ping would undoubtedly die!
However, for the sake of caution, after arranging the three Divine Clan Blood Guards at Divine Sword Manor, Qin Lie immediately headed non-stop to the Black Wind Mountain Range!
Chen Ping had been searching for the branch hall of the Evil Path Hall. Qin Lie had also inquired about this!
After all, Chen Ping had caused such a commotion at the Information Building. Almost everyone in Sword Saint City knew about it!
As long as he could invite people from the Evil Path Hall, this time it would be secure!
Black Wind Mountain Range…
In the miasma-filled valley, on an altar piled with skull heads, You Wuxie was sitting cross-legged.
Dense black qi surrounded his body. His originally illusory figure had solidified considerably. Evidently, by relying on the secret arts of the Evil Path Hall, he had recovered most of his strength. His physical body had also been restored.
“Elder, Qin Lie of Divine Sword Manor requests an audience.” A green-faced, fanged guard stepped forward to report.
You Wuxie opened his eyes; a trace of cold light flashed in his pupils. “Let him in.”
When Qin Lie stepped onto the altar, he could not help but shiver.
Human skeletons hung all around the altar. The air was filled with a dense bloody smell. Compared to the hypocrisy of the Holy Light Sect, this was truly a hell on earth.
“Brother You, long time no see?”
Qin Lie forcibly suppressed his discomfort and cupped his hands with a smile.
You Wuxie slowly stood up, stretching his newly formed body. His bones made crackling sounds. “Manor Lord Qin graces us with his presence. What brings you here?”
“I wish to cooperate with the Evil Path Hall to eliminate one person.”
Qin Lie got straight to the point. “This person also has old grudges with Brother You.”
“Who is it?”
“Chen Ping!”
“Chen Ping?” You Wuxie suddenly clenched his fist; black qi surged in his palm. “That bastard who destroyed my physical body!”
Footsteps came from behind the altar. You Wuji and his daughter You Yue slowly walked out.
After they escaped, they had found You Wuxie and were temporarily residing here!
You Yue’s face carried venom. “Uncle, this Chen Ping destroyed our sect, and the Hu Mazi with him even took my innocence!”
You Yue had long wanted to kill Chen Ping and Hu Mazi. Unfortunately, You Wuxie’s physical body had not recovered until now, so they had been waiting.
You Wuji heartbrokenly stroked his daughter’s head and said to You Wuxie. “Brother, we must kill that Chen Ping!”
You Wuxie nodded and looked at Qin Lie, asking. “How does Manor Lord Qin wish to cooperate?”
“I have already invited experts from the Sixth Hall of the Divine Hall. We only need the Evil Path Hall to contribute some effort, and Chen Ping will surely find it hard to escape even with wings!” Qin Lie said in a deep voice. “After the deed is done, the treasures on Chen Ping’s body can be selected first by the Evil Path Hall!”
Greed flashed in You Wuxie’s eyes. “Is this true?”
“Absolutely no falsehood!”
Just at this moment, a sinister voice came from the depths of the altar. “Since it’s dealing with someone protected by Li Chunfeng, how could this seat miss out?”
