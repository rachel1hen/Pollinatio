Chen Ping held Ling Xue’s hand, the warmth from his palm made her tremble slightly.
He placed the Demon Suppressing Tower in a hidden stone cave behind the Sword Sect, so there was no need for anyone to guard it.
The cave had a stone door covered in flowing runes, exuding an ancient and heavy aura. Ordinary people could not open it easily.
“The flow of time inside this tower is different from the outside. One day here equals a hundred days outside. Let us cultivate in peace within.”
Chen Ping spoke softly, his fingertip brushing across the stone door. The moment his spiritual power entered, the runes lit up and slowly opened a gap just wide enough for two people to pass through.
Ling Xue lowered her head, her cheeks blushing like rosy clouds. “I will follow Senior Brother.”
Before she finished speaking, Chen Ping gently pulled her wrist, stepping with her into the shimmering light.
He led Ling Xue into the Demon Suppressing Tower. Inside was not the dark and narrow space she had imagined, but a vast world.
The air was thick with immortal energy, almost tangible, with various immortal veins surrounding them. One could faintly hear the sound of immortal energy surging.
“This place… is truly like a celestial realm?” Ling Xue exclaimed in awe, her eyes full of astonishment.
She had always thought the Demon Suppressing Tower was a place to confine evil spirits, but never imagined it would look like this inside.
Chen Ping smiled and nodded. “This tower can not only suppress demons, it is also a sacred land for cultivation. You can cultivate here without worry, I will bring Master Hu Ma over.”
With that, his figure flashed and he disappeared.
In just a moment, Chen Ping returned with Hu Mazi.
The moment Hu Mazi stepped inside, the rich immortal energy shocked him, his eyes widened as he took a deep breath, his face bursting with joy. “Good heavens, the immortal energy here is even denser now. You must have stored a lot of resources in this tower!”
“Of course. All the resources I gathered, I placed inside the Demon Suppressing Tower. That is why the energy here is so abundant.”
“Master Hu, find a stone platform to recover. The energy here will greatly benefit your injuries. My junior sister and I will be cultivating over there. Call me if you need anything.”
Hu Mazi nodded repeatedly, rubbing his hands excitedly as he rushed toward a stone platform. As soon as he jumped up, he sat cross-legged, eagerly running his cultivation technique. A whirlpool of immortal energy soon swirled visibly around him.
Chen Ping brought Ling Xue to a secluded spot. The area was covered by a faint golden barrier that shielded them from disturbance while gathering immortal energy.
Turning to her, he looked with a gentle smile. “The days ahead will be hard on you.”
Ling Xue bit her lip, giving a soft “mm,” her fingers unconsciously twisting at the corner of her clothes.
The memory of that intimate night in the room flashed uncontrollably in her mind, making her breathing quicken.
Chen Ping said no more. He sat cross-legged first, motioning for Ling Xue to sit opposite him.
When their palms touched, a pure stream of spiritual power flowed along their arms, forming a perfect cycle between their meridians.
Chen Ping’s dragon power carried a dominant and vigorous force, while Ling Xue’s energy was gentle like a clear spring. As the two blended, they created a mysterious resonance.
Soon, Ling Xue’s clothes slipped off by themselves, leaving her completely bare before Chen Ping.
Chen Ping then joined with her, giving her the most masculine part of himself.
Time passed quietly as they cultivated.
One day outside, a hundred days inside.
At first, Ling Xue frowned slightly, unaccustomed to the process, but as their fusion deepened, she gradually sank into the profound wonder of cultivation.
Unconsciously, cries escaped her lips, growing louder and louder. Fortunately, they were inside the Demon Suppressing Tower, so nothing reached the outside world.
Chen Ping was fully immersed. His dragon power not only tempered Ling Xue’s meridians, it also guided her spiritual energy to break through its bottleneck. In just a few dozen days, Ling Xue already felt faint signs of a breakthrough in her cultivation.
