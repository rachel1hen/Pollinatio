A crisp “clang” rang out as the shield trembled violently but remained intact.
“With such meager skills, you dare to rob travelers?”
Chen Ping snorted coldly, his Dragon-Slaying Sword flashing like a stream of light, piercing the wolf-headed man’s shoulder in an instant.
“Argh!”
The wolf-headed man let out a pained howl, clutching his bleeding shoulder as he staggered back, eyes filled with fear, “You… who are you?”
“Just passing cultivators,” Chen Ping said coolly, “If you don’t want to die, clear the way!”
The wolf-headed man glanced at his groaning subordinates on the ground and the sharp aura emanating from Chen Ping’s sword, realizing he was no match. He quickly fled with his men in a sorry state.
“These demon cultivators are too weak,” Hu Mazi remarked, surprised, as he watched the wolf-headed man’s retreating figure.
“These are just small fry. The real experts are likely inside Black Wind Stronghold.”
Chen Ping sheathed his sword, “Let’s keep moving, but stay cautious.”
The two ventured deeper into the misty forest. After about the time it takes to burn an incense stick, the fog began to thin, revealing a massive stronghold ahead.
The stronghold’s walls were built from huge black stones, adorned with black flags bearing a ferocious wolf-head emblem.
At the entrance stood two bear demons, each three zhang tall, wielding giant hammers, their vigilant gazes fixed on passersby.
“This is Black Wind Stronghold,” Chen Ping said, eyeing the bear demons, “These two have strength comparable to second-grade Earth Immortal cultivators.”
“How do we get in?” Hu Mazi asked.
“We walk right in,” Chen Ping replied, “We’ll pose as cultivators seeking to join Black Wind Stronghold and gather information.”
They approached the entrance, where the bear demons immediately blocked their path, “Halt! Who are you, and what’s your business here?”
“We’re passing cultivators, hoping to join Black Wind Stronghold. Please inform your leader,” Chen Ping said, slipping a few immortal stones into the bear demon’s hand.
The bear demon weighed the stones, a satisfied smile crossing its face, “Wait here, I’ll report to the leader.”
Soon, the bear demon returned, saying, “The leader will see you. Go in.”
Following the bear demon, they entered the stronghold, which was livelier than expected. Demon cultivators were everywhere—wolf demons, tiger demons, snake demons, and more, each with a distinct form, exuding thick demonic energy.
At the center stood a massive meeting hall, guarded by two fox demons with long swords. Their appearances were striking, but their eyes were ice-cold.
The bear demon led them to the hall’s entrance, saying, “The leader’s inside. Go in yourselves.”
Inside, they saw a middle-aged man in a black robe sitting at the center, his face grim and a cold smile on his lips. This was the leader of Black Wind Stronghold, the Black Wind Old Demon.
Flanking him were a dozen demon cultivators, each with a powerful aura, clearly the stronghold’s core members.
“You’re the cultivators here to join me?” the Black Wind Old Demon asked, his eyes glinting with scrutiny as he looked at Chen Ping and Hu Mazi.
“Yes, Leader,” Chen Ping replied, “We’ve heard of Black Wind Stronghold’s might and wish to serve you.”
“Oh? What skills do you have?” the Black Wind Old Demon inquired.
“We know some basic spells and can fight for you,” Chen Ping said.
“Hahaha…” the Black Wind Old Demon laughed, “You two think you’re fit to serve me? Black Wind Stronghold doesn’t take in trash!”
“If you doubt us, Leader, test our skills,” Chen Ping suggested.
“Fine! I’ll give you a chance,” the Black Wind Old Demon said, “We’ve got a grudge with Green Snake Valley to the east. Kill their valley master, bring me his head, and I’ll accept you.”
