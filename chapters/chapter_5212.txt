With a crisp “clang,” the head of the giant green snake collided with the sword qi barrier, producing a loud crash. The snake was jolted back several steps.
“Somewhat interesting.”
The voice of the Green Snake Valley Lord came from the snake’s mouth, carrying a hint of surprise, “I didn’t expect two mere human cultivators to possess such strength.”
He opened his massive jaws again, spewing a stream of green venom towards the pair.
The venom transformed into countless tiny, sharp arrows in the air, emitting a pungent odour, clearly highly toxic.
Chen Ping’s eyes sharpened. His spiritual energy surged, enveloping them in a pale golden shield.
The venom landed on the shield, sizzling but unable to penetrate.
“Your venom is useless against us!”
Chen Ping declared, as his Dragon-Slaying Sword turned into a streak of light, thrusting towards the vital spot seven inches down the green snake’s body.
The Green Snake Valley Lord hadn’t anticipated Chen Ping’s attack to be so fierce. He hastily twisted his body, dodging the sword.
Yet his tail was still grazed by the sword qi, leaving a deep, bone-revealing wound, with green blood gushing out.
“Seeking death!”
The Green Snake Valley Lord roared in fury. His massive body thrashed through the valley, toppling countless trees and sending rocks flying.
Hu Mazi seized the moment, pulling out several talisman papers. He swiftly drew thunder talismans and hurled them at the green snake.
The thunder talismans erupted in dazzling light mid-air, with countless bolts of lightning striking the snake.
Struck by the lightning, the green snake let out a pained scream, its massive body trembling violently.
Chen Ping seized the opportunity. His Dragon-Slaying Sword struck again, precisely piercing the snake’s vital seven-inch spot.
“Roar—”
The Green Snake Valley Lord let out a piercing scream. His massive body convulsed on the ground a few times before finally lying still.
The two finally breathed a sigh of relief, collapsing to the ground, panting heavily.
“Finally… dealt with.”
Hu Mazi wiped the sweat from his face, saying, “I didn’t expect the Green Snake Valley Lord’s strength to be this formidable.”
Chen Ping replied, “That’s normal. At the same cultivation level, the demon race is stronger than the human race, just like the demon tribe. This is why humans are the most looked down upon among the three races.”
Just then, cheers from two wolf demons came from outside the valley, “Great! They really killed the Green Snake Valley Lord!”
The two wolf demons entered the valley, eyeing the corpse of the Green Snake Valley Lord with greedy smiles.
“Didn’t expect you two to actually pull it off,” one wolf demon said, “but the corpse and treasures of the Green Snake Valley Lord belong to our Black Wind Stronghold.”
“What do you want?” Hu Mazi asked warily, eyeing the two wolf demons.
“What do we want?” the other wolf demon sneered, “To kill you and claim the credit, of course!”
The two wolf demons attacked simultaneously, charging at Chen Ping and Hu Mazi.
Chen Ping’s eyes turned cold. He hadn’t expected these wolf demons to betray them. He unleashed his Dragon-Slaying Sword, instantly killing one of them.
The other wolf demon, terrified out of his wits, turned to flee. Hu Mazi quickly pulled out a talisman, drew a binding talisman, and threw it at the demon.
The binding talisman landed, freezing the wolf demon in place, unable to move.
“Spare me! Spare me!” the wolf demon pleaded in panic.
“You’re still useful,” Chen Ping said, “Tell me, is the Black Wind Demon connected to the extermination of the Hu Clan years ago?”
The wolf demon froze, clearly not expecting the question. He hesitated, then said, “I don’t know anything about the Hu Clan’s extermination. I’m just a small fry.”
“Not telling the truth, huh?” Hu Mazi said, pulling out a fireball talisman, threatening, “Speak, or I’ll burn you to ashes!”
