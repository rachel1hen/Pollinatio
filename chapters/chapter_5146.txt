After Hu Mazi finished speaking, he suddenly froze, his expression stiffening.
“Chen Ping, did you feel that?”
Hu Mazi leaned closer to Chen Ping, lowering his voice, “It feels like someone is following us.”
Chen Ping’s lips curled slightly, a glint of gold flashing in his eyes, “Five of them, all around the ninth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, probably from that mysterious organisation.”
With such strength, Chen Ping couldn’t think of anyone else besides that mysterious organisation.
In the Triple Heaven, the peak of the Loose Immortal Realm was the strongest, and those at the ninth rank were sect leaders.
But this mysterious organisation seemed to have exceptional strength. According to Yun Wuya, the place where this organisation resided didn’t seem to fall under the Triple Heaven’s jurisdiction.
“Should we…?”
Hu Mazi made a throat-slitting gesture.
Chen Ping shook his head lightly, “Let them follow, it’ll be interesting to see what they’re up to.”
Chen Ping had long noticed these people but hadn’t said anything. If they wanted to follow, he’d let them!
Five ninth-rank Loose Immortals, Chen Ping could handle them.
Hu Mazi said nothing more and approached Yun Wuya, starting to inquire about the Blood Shadow Palace.
After all, Yun Wuya was from the Triple Heaven and surely knew a lot about the Blood Shadow Palace.
“Master Yun, is it true that the Blood Shadow Palace has thousands of female cultivators? How do they look?”
Hu Mazi asked.
Yun Wuya gave a wry smile, “Master Hu, the female cultivators of the Blood Shadow Palace are all beautiful, especially the Saintess of the Blood Shadow Palace, known as the number one beauty of the Triple Heaven, but also notoriously ruthless.”
“She practises the Blood Shadow Technique, which requires absorbing the essence of men. Over the years, at least eight hundred, if not a thousand, cultivators have died under her charm.”
“Damn, so the female cultivators of the Blood Shadow Palace rely on such evil techniques to cultivate? Doesn’t that mean none of them are pure?”
Hu Mazi frowned, looking somewhat disappointed.
“Master Hu, those women have a certain allure.”
“The Saintess of the Blood Shadow Palace is said to be exceptional in bed. Many men willingly let her drain them.”
“There’s a saying in the Triple Heaven: sleeping with the Saintess of the Blood Shadow Palace is worth more than becoming a True Immortal.”
Yun Wuya whispered to Hu Mazi.
Hu Mazi’s eyes lit up, “That exciting? Then I definitely have to meet her!”
Chen Ping shook his head helplessly. It seemed Hu Mazi’s obsession with women would never fade, short of death!
The group flew for five days, and soon, the outline of mountains appeared in the distance.
There, shrouded in mist, stood a crimson palace atop the peak, resembling blood, it was the Blood Shadow Palace.
“We’re here.”
Chen Ping stopped, “Master Hu, the stage is yours.”
Chen Ping knew Hu Mazi could handle the people of the Blood Shadow Palace with ease, after all, he was once from the Sixth Heaven.
Hu Mazi adjusted his robe and sprayed some unknown perfume on himself.
“What are you doing…?”
Chen Ping’s eye twitched.
“Pre-battle preparations.”
Hu Mazi said seriously, “When facing female cultivators, image is crucial.”
Everyone was speechless.
At that moment, a sharp whistle came from the direction of the Blood Shadow Palace, followed by hundreds of red figures flying out from the palace, forming a battle array in the air.
“Looks like they already know we’re here.”
Chen Ping narrowed his eyes, “News of the Tianyan Sect’s destruction spreads fast.”
Hu Mazi, however, remained calm, pulling out a fan folded from talismans and flicking it open with a flourish, “Watch me.”
With a light tap of his foot, he floated toward the Blood Shadow Palace like a feather.
His elegance was a stark contrast to his usual self.
“This old lecher, what a show-off…” Chen Ping muttered, exasperated.
“Chen Ping, do you think Master Hu might get devoured by those Blood Shadow Palace female cultivators? His body isn’t as strong as yours, after all.”
Huo Jingjing asked Chen Ping.
