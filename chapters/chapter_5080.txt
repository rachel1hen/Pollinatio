At these words, half of the Mo family elders voiced their agreement.
Mo Qingchen had long since secretly won over these people, and now, seeing the opportunity ripen, they collectively turned against Mo Wuji.
“The family head’s actions were indeed improper!”
“The Mo family cannot be ruined by one man’s hand!”
“Please, Young Master Tianci, uphold justice for the Mo family!”
Mo Wuji’s eyes widened, staring at the faces that once grovelled before him, now brimming with betrayal. A wave of dizziness washed over him.
He staggered, clutching a pillar, his nails nearly digging into his palms, “You… you actually…”
“Father!” Mo Qingyun cried out, wanting to rush forward but was gently held back by Chen Ping.
She turned to look at Chen Ping, only to see his calm expression, a faint sneer playing on his lips.
Chen Ping had long noticed that Mo Qingchen, in collusion with Elder Tong and the others, was plotting to seize the position of family head!
“Done talking?”
Chen Ping finally spoke, his eyes filled with disdain, “A bunch of clowns daring to play tricks in front of me?”
“You’ve already planned this, haven’t you? Why bother with this hypocritical act?”
“And you two defeated losers, still haven’t learned your lesson?”
Chen Ping’s words stunned the Mo family members!
Especially Mo Qingchen, who had no idea that Chen Ping had fought and defeated Elder Tong and Tianci!
It seemed Chen Ping had bested them both!
Elder Tong’s pupils contracted, and he instinctively took half a step back.
The losses he suffered at Chen Ping’s hands were still vivid, and now, facing the surging aura around Chen Ping, he felt an oppressive force like confronting a mountain.
But thinking of the dozen or so experts he brought, all at the fifth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, he steeled himself and sneered, “Chen Ping, do you really think you can take on Tianyuan Pavilion single-handedly?”
Though he knew Chen Ping could fight above his level, with so many of them, Chen Ping surely couldn’t win!
Even a fierce tiger can’t withstand a pack!
“Take on?”
Chen Ping raised an eyebrow, flicking his finger lightly. A golden light grazed past Elder Tong’s ear, slicing off a strand of white hair, “With trash like you?”
Tianci roared in fury, “Kill him!”
Before his words settled, over a dozen figures struck simultaneously! A torrent of terrifying auras crashed toward Chen Ping like a storm, reducing the entire council hall to ashes in an instant.
Mo Qingyun’s face paled, instinctively wanting to rush forward, but Mo Wuji held her back tightly.
He knew that Mo Qingyun rushing in would only mean certain death.
Now, it all depended on Chen Ping’s strength.
Suddenly, a golden light appeared around Chen Ping, followed by golden scales covering his entire body!
The Indestructible Golden Body was activated!
At the same time, two streams of black mist surged from Chen Ping’s body, transforming into two warrior statues!
The two warriors, wielding great swords, shattered the violent auras with ease.
The stray energies struck Chen Ping, yet he neither dodged nor flinched, standing firm as a mountain.
“This… how is this possible?”
Mo Qingchen was dumbfounded, retreating instinctively, only to meet Tianci’s icy gaze.
Elder Tong’s brows furrowed, his heart pounding with fear.
A dozen fifth-rank Loose Immortal experts couldn’t even shake Chen Ping?
And those two warrior statues were simply outrageous!
Mo Wuji, seeing this, trembled with excitement. He had long known Chen Ping was extraordinary, but he hadn’t expected him to be this formidable. It seemed he had bet on the right person!
“Just this much skill?”
Chen Ping sneered, raising his hand with a light wave.
A surge of aura spread like a tidal wave in all directions.
The attacking Tianyuan Pavilion experts were pushed back as if by an invisible giant hand, sent flying.
As the Tianyuan Pavilion experts were thrown back, the two warrior statues leaped into action!
The dozen or so Tianyuan Pavilion experts clashed with the two warriors!
But as soon as the fight began, the Tianyuan Pavilion experts felt the pressure!
After all, these two warriors weren’t living beings; they had no thoughts and no fear of death.
Amidst screams, Tianyuan Pavilion experts began to fall one by one!
