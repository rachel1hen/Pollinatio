The golden dragon and black fire snake clashed fiercely in the air, the resulting energy turbulence slicing nearby mountain peaks in half.
Ghost Face and the others were forced to retreat a hundred zhang, barely stabilizing themselves.
“How many trump cards does this kid have?”
The grey-robed elder eyed the ferocious golden dragon in the sky, a flicker of caution in his gaze, “Twelve Nether Lamps, lock his soul!”
Twelve green lamps flew out, circling Chen Ping, their soul flames transforming into countless chains, attempting to bind the dragon.
The red-robed woman seized the chance to regroup, her nine ribbons turning into a blood-red phoenix, joining the brute’s giant axe and the misty figure’s icy wind in a coordinated assault on Chen Ping.
The five moved in perfect sync, their attacks relentless like a storm.
Chen Ping felt the pressure surge, the dragon gradually weakening as it was entangled by the black fire snake.
His clothes were already torn to shreds by the energy aftermath, and the scales of his Unbreakable Golden Body began to fall.
Fortunately, Chen Ping had trained in the Barbaric Body Refining Technique, so his body remained unharmed!
“This won’t do, I can’t hold out until they finish moving the resources…”
Anxious, Chen Ping glanced toward the vault, seeing disciples continuously hauling out storage bags, a ruthless glint in his eyes.
The golden scales on his body peeled away, cracks appearing in the Unbreakable Golden Body’s defence under the five’s combined assault.
From the vault came the crisp clink of spirit stones, hundreds of disciples rushing out with bulging storage bags. Hu Mazi, now clad in black iron armour, was stuffing glowing pills into his mouth as he ran.
“Hold on! Ten more breaths!”
Yun Wuya’s voice was hoarse, the thirty-six azure flags forming the mountain-protection array already scorched with gaps by the black fire, the grey-robed elder’s Nether Lamp chains coiling around the array’s core.
Chen Ping gritted his teeth, slamming his left hand onto his storage ring, which erupted in blinding red light.
“Fire Qilin, come forth…”
Chen Ping knew he couldn’t defeat these five with his own strength!
Though all five were ninth-grade Loose Immortals, their power was formidable, likely not inferior to peak ninth-grade Loose Immortals.
Chen Ping couldn’t fathom what this mysterious organisation was!
How could they, in the Third Heaven, create a separate space with such terrifyingly strong subordinates!
With a roar that split the clouds, a Qilin wreathed in crimson fire feathers stepped into the air, its four hooves leaving trails of distorted fire waves.
“A Fire Qilin?”
The red-robed woman’s blood-red ribbons trembled, her nine silks instantly retracting, “That’s an ancient divine beast!”
The Fire Qilin flicked its flaming tail, golden pupils locking onto Ghost Face and the others, spewing a pillar of flame as thick as a water tank.
Ghost Face dodged, the black fire snake colliding with the fire wave, scattering sparks across the sky.
The bare-chested brute roared, swinging his axe at the Qilin’s neck, only for the Qilin to slap its claw against the axe, cracking the millstone-sized weapon with web-like fractures.
“Attack together!”
Ghost Face shouted, his right hand’s black fire forming a ghostly claw, “Beast-Summoning Array, activate!”
The five instantly formed a formation, the grey-robed elder’s twelve Nether Lamps hovering at the array’s core.
The red-robed woman’s ribbons turned into blood-red veins wrapping the array’s base, the brute and the misty figure standing on either side, their auras funnelling into Ghost Face.
The sky darkened abruptly, five dark purple beams rising from their heads, converging high above into the vague outline of a giant beast.
“That’s… the Ghost Beast Taotie?”
Yun Wuya’s face paled, the azure flag array’s glow dimming instantly.
“Mr. Chen, be careful, they’ve summoned a Ghost Beast!” Yun Wuya warned Chen Ping!
Amid the churning black mist, a Taotie phantom with hundreds of eyes emerged, its gaping maw emitting a devouring hiss as it swallowed the very air.
The Fire Qilin pawed the ground uneasily, its flaming mane bristling, clearly sensing the pressure of a natural predator.
