Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun left, as Chen Ping could not help much with the rebuilding of the Asura Hall!
The successive possessions had severely injured Chen Ping’s body, so he needed to continue recovering in the Demon-Suppressing Tower!
Fortunately, with the Demon-Suppressing Tower, even if Chen Ping recovered for a year, only a few days would pass in the outside world!
Returning to the Eight Halls, Chen Ping directly entered the Demon-Suppressing Tower to begin his recovery!
However, while Chen Ping was recovering, the situation in the Second Heaven, following the destruction of the Asura Hall and the fall of the Tianyuan Pavilion leader, descended into complete chaos.
The two major powers that once maintained balance had collapsed, and various factions, like sharks smelling blood, bared their fangs.
The Mo family, along with the Eight Halls, were inevitably drawn into the conflict, forced to fight to survive in the Second Heaven.
The Second Heaven was in utter disarray, with some long-dormant alliances of rogue cultivators also attempting to seize a share of the spoils in this turmoil.
The scramble for resources grew increasingly fierce, once-prosperous cities turned into battlefields, and wails of anguish echoed through every corner of the Second Heaven.
Outside the Demon-Suppressing Tower, Mo Qingyun and Huo Jingjing stood guard daily, their hearts filled with worry.
With the Second Heaven in such chaos, the two of them were uncertain about the fate of their respective families and when Chen Ping would finish recovering!
Meanwhile, Hu Mazi took advantage of the chaos in the Second Heaven, occasionally going out to rescue a few female cultivators, calling it heroic salvation, but in truth, he was just seeking amusement!
The rescued female cultivators, grateful to Hu Mazi, willingly offered themselves to him.
Three days later, the Demon-Suppressing Tower began to tremble violently, with dazzling beams of light bursting from within.
A radiant glow bloomed at the tower’s peak, forming a pillar of light that shot straight into the sky.
Mo Qingyun and the others quickly stepped aside, only to see a figure, cloaked in powerful pressure, slowly emerging.
Chen Ping, dressed in simple cloth, his hair fluttering in the wind, was surrounded by a faint, ethereal immortal aura.
His eyes had become even more profound, and his every gesture exuded a heart-stopping presence.
At this moment, his cultivation had reached the fifth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, his strength far surpassing that of peak Loose Immortal Realm experts.
With a gentle wave of his hand, the Demon-Suppressing Tower turned into a streak of light and vanished into his storage ring.
Chen Ping had actually advanced his realm again, his progress akin to riding a rocket!
“Chen Ping!”
Huo Jingjing was the first to react, rushing towards Chen Ping.
Though Mo Qingyun was also overjoyed, she maintained her usual elegance, following closely behind.
“I’m fine.”
Chen Ping smiled at the two, his voice gentle yet filled with strength.
He turned to look at the smoke-filled sky in the distance, his eyes instantly turning cold, “What’s happened to the Second Heaven?”
Mo Qingyun recounted everything to Chen Ping, and only then did he learn that the entire Second Heaven had fallen into chaos!
The simultaneous collapse of Tianyuan Pavilion and the Asura Hall had caused restless factions to stir!
“The Second Heaven needs to settle down.”
Chen Ping said calmly!
At that moment, Huo Zhao, leading the people of the Eight Halls, had been engaged in bloody battles around the Eight Halls for two consecutive days!
Many factions sought to seize the Eight Halls’ resources and take over their territory!
“Huo Zhao, I’ve long known you betrayed the Divine Hall, and now the Divine Hall no longer cares about you!”
“You’d better obediently surrender your territory, hand over your resources, and get lost!”
A black-robed elder at the sixth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm spoke smugly to Huo Zhao!
Behind this elder stood tens of thousands of cultivators, each wielding weapons, their momentum overwhelming!
In contrast, Huo Zhao had only a few dozen disciples of the Eight Halls behind him, their strength vastly outmatched!
But Huo Zhao knew that Chen Ping was still recovering in the tower, if these people were to disturb him, Chen Ping might fall into deviation!
“Unless you kill every single person in the Eight Halls, we will never surrender!”
Huo Zhao declared with resolute determination!
