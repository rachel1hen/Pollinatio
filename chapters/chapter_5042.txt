Chen Ping shielded Mo Qingyun, watching the two men fight!
The white-robed man and the green-robed man were evenly matched, neither gaining an advantage.
After a hundred moves, both struck a palm simultaneously, their figures instantly separating by a hundred yards.
Terrifying waves of force surged towards Chen Ping and the others.
However, Chen Ping noticed that when these shockwaves reached the ferocious ghost statues, they vanished in mid-air.
Such terrifying power would have reduced an ordinary stone mountain to dust by now.
Yet the towering pillar stood firm, completely unaffected by the two men.
Boom!
The two, who had just separated, clashed again, looking as if they bore a mortal grudge, unwilling to stop until one was defeated.
Around them, space itself seemed to warp and distort.
“You two, give me some face and stop fighting…”
Chen Ping couldn’t stand it any longer, swinging his Dragon-Slaying Sword.
A terrifying sword beam slashed towards the two.
Both men, shocked, hurriedly parted to dodge the sword beam.
They stared at Chen Ping in disbelief.
In a fight like theirs, any other first-rank Loose Immortal would have been caught in the crossfire, bleeding from all orifices and dead by now.
Yet Chen Ping was not only unscathed but had also split them apart with a single sword strike.
Seeing them separate, Chen Ping led Mo Qingyun towards them.
“Done fighting? I told you, give me some face. We’re all here for treasure, so why resort to violence?”
Chen Ping tried to reason with them.
“Who are you, exactly?” the green-robed man asked Chen Ping.
“Didn’t I say? Just a guy seeking treasure…”
Chen Ping gave a faint smile.
“You, a first-rank Loose Immortal, have such strength. Are you some secluded prodigy from Tianyuan Pavilion?”
The white-robed man frowned, questioning Chen Ping.
Chen Ping had no idea what Tianyuan Pavilion was, so he shook his head, saying, “I told you, I’m here for treasure, not from any Tianyuan Pavilion.”
“You two, I’m Mo Qingyun, the eldest daughter of the Mo family…”
Mo Qingyun took the initiative to introduce herself.
“The Mo family?” The green-robed man was visibly surprised.
The white-robed man clasped his hands, saying, “So it’s the Mo family’s eldest daughter. My apologies…”
“Alright, since we’ve all ended up at this ruin, it’s fate. Let’s focus on what dangers this place might hold.”
“If there’s danger, we’ll need to work together. Save your grudges for after we leave.”
Chen Ping continued to mediate.
Neither man spoke, still shaken by Chen Ping’s earlier sword strike.
Without that display, a first-rank Loose Immortal like him trying to mediate between two fifth-rank Loose Immortals would’ve been laughable.
They might have attacked him already.
To mediate and be heard, one needs real skill.
Seeing both men silent, Chen Ping ignored them and slowly approached the two ferocious ghost statues.
The closer he got, the stronger the oppressive, fearful feeling in his heart grew.
Yet Mo Qingyun, beside him, seemed unaffected, leaving Chen Ping unsure if he was the only one feeling it.
Suppress Ленин
Suppressing his fear, Chen Ping led Mo Qingyun to the base of the ghost statues.
Compared to the towering statues, Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun seemed as small as ants.
Chen Ping noticed a stone door beneath one of the statues, carved with mysterious runes.
The two men followed Chen Ping and stood behind him at the statues.
