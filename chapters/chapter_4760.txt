“You three took Mr. Chen’s spirit stones. Are you betraying him?”
Seeing this, Xuan Bin frowned and questioned the three black-robed cultivators!
After all, these three were also brought by Xuan Bin, though he didn’t know their true identities.
“Everyone has their own ambitions. We hope Fellow Daoist Xuan Bin can understand. Thirty thousand spirit stones are simply too tempting to resist,” one of the black-robed cultivators replied.
“If you dare to oppose Mr. Chen, you’re opposing me as well. In that case, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”
Xuan Bin’s face darkened, and he prepared to attack the three.
Zhou Tang and Hua Yueying also readied themselves to act. Since their paths diverged, they could only become enemies.
However, Chen Ping raised his hand to stop Xuan Bin and calmly said, “People die for wealth, birds die for food. They helped me for the spirit stones, and now they’re helping the Tenth Hall for the same reason. Of course, they’ll side with whoever offers more. That’s only natural.”
“Mr. Chen, they took your spirit stones first,” Xuan Bin said angrily.
“I know. Since they’ve chosen to betray, let them go. Everyone has their own choices. They took my spirit stones but won’t work for me. I won’t hold it against them.”
Chen Ping spoke with great magnanimity.
Chen Ping said this to make Xuan Bin and the others even more loyal to him.
After all, if he could be so forgiving toward those who betrayed him, those who remained loyal would surely receive even greater rewards.
Seeing this, the Tenth Hall Master smiled slightly. “Well said—’people die for wealth, birds die for food.’ I quite like that phrase. Here, I’ll give you the spirit stones now.”
With that, the Tenth Hall Master tossed out a storage bag containing ninety thousand spirit stones—thirty thousand for each of the three black-robed cultivators.
The three black-robed cultivators took the spirit stones and immediately turned to face Chen Ping and the others.
Xuan Bin and the others were on high alert, ready to strike at any moment.
“Now that you’ve taken the payment, shouldn’t you act?” the Tenth Hall Master urged the three black-robed cultivators.
One of the black-robed cultivators reached into his robe, seemingly to draw a weapon.
But when he pulled his hand out, there was no weapon—just another storage bag.
He then tossed the storage bag to Chen Ping.
This move left everyone stunned.
“Mr. Chen, my brothers and I took thirty thousand spirit stones from you. Now we’re returning fifty thousand as compensation for our betrayal.”
“Although the Tenth Hall Master isn’t much, the Tenth Hall is backed by the Divine Hall. My brothers and I don’t want to offend the Divine Hall. We hope you can understand.”
The black-robed cultivator spoke earnestly.
“I understand,” Chen Ping nodded.
“If Mr. Chen ever needs us for anything else, my brothers and I will not hesitate to help. But today, we must withdraw.”
With that, the three black-robed cultivators turned and left without looking back.
“My spirit stones! My spirit stones!” the Tenth Hall Master shouted in frustration.
“Tenth Hall Master, not only are you weak, but you’re also not very bright,” Chen Ping said with a faint smile.
“Dammit…” The Tenth Hall Master’s face turned red with anger.
“Tenth Hall Master, does your earlier offer still stand? I suddenly feel like I want some spirit stones too,” Xuan Bin teased.
The Tenth Hall Master’s eyes narrowed, and his aura surged to its peak. The temperature around them dropped to freezing.
“You bastards, you deserve to die, die, die!”
The Tenth Hall Master repeated “die” three times, showing just how furious he was.
“I think the one who deserves to die is you,” Lin Kefan said, then turned to Chen Ping. “Brother-in-law, what are you waiting for? Kill this guy already. If anyone from the Divine Hall dares to seek revenge, my Sun-Moon City will stand with you!”
