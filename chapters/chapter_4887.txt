“You need to rein yourself in from now on, no matter how many women you have, it’s all just fleeting pleasure, once you reach the Heavenly Realm, you’ll face even greater challenges!”
“I’m leaving too, once you’re in the Heavenly Realm, I might not be able to help you so freely anymore, it’ll all be up to you!”
“Remember, cultivate diligently…”
With that, Mr. Shi’s body began to dissolve into countless specks of white light before everyone’s eyes, slowly fading away!
“Mr. Shi…”
Chen Ping shouted, but there was no response!
Above the ninth level of the Skyward Ladder, a young boy called out into the void, “Master, he’s gone, come out quick!”
An old man cautiously poked his head out of the void, his expression tense, “Disciple, he’s really gone?”
“Really gone!” The boy nodded!
“You scared the hell out of me.” The old man patted his chest, then said, “Disciple, keep the floodgates open, keep letting water flow for that Chen Ping!”
“Master, it’s already a deluge, how much more can I let out?” The boy frowned slightly!
“Just do it when I tell you, stop yapping!” The old man smacked the boy’s head, then vanished!
The boy pouted, “…”
…
Celestial Realm!
Mu Sha’s emotions gradually settled, and he looked at Chen Ping with deep gratitude, “Mr. Chen, since I’ve promised to serve you for three hundred years, I’ll never go back on my word.”
“I’m taking my wife back to the Heavenly Realm now, to help her slowly regain her lost memories!”
“When you reach the Heavenly Realm, Mr. Chen, feel free to call on me anytime!”
“Take care, Senior Mu Sha!” Chen Ping nodded!
In the Celestial Realm, Chen Ping was already invincible, so he didn’t need Mu Sha’s help for now!
Mu Sha nodded, then with his wife, turned into a beam of golden light and shot into the sky!
Watching Mu Sha depart, Nan Batian, Li Chunfeng, and Shen Zhiyan all wore envious expressions!
They were Heavenly Realm immortals themselves, once imprisoned in the Skyward Ladder, now with a chance to return, of course they longed to go back!
Chen Ping saw their intentions and said, “Seniors, the Celestial Realm holds no danger for me now, you should return to the Heavenly Realm too, if I need your help in the future, I’ll seek you out!”
Nan Batian, Li Chunfeng, and Shen Zhiyan exchanged glances, they knew Chen Ping was deliberately setting them free!
The three knelt before Chen Ping in unison, saying, “Mr. Chen, we’ll never forget your great kindness today, when you need us, we’ll brave fire and water for you!”
Chen Ping, touched, moved to lift them up and offer heartfelt thanks!
But before he could, the moment their words ended, they turned into beams of golden light and vanished into the horizon!
“Damn…”
Chen Ping was speechless!
“Emperor Lin, I’m heading back to the Heavenly Realm too, thanks to your hospitality all these years, I’m endlessly grateful!”
“When you ascend to the Heavenly Realm someday, I’ll play chess with you again and take you to see all the immortal mountains!”
Wuji Daoist, watching everyone leave, couldn’t hold back any longer!
Trapped for thousands of years, who wouldn’t want to go?
“Daoist, if we meet again, I’ll definitely find you for a game!” Lin Chong smiled faintly!
“Master…”
Lin Keting knew Wuji Daoist was returning to the Heavenly Realm!
This parting might mean years, even decades, before they’d meet again, with her current strength, ascending to the Heavenly Realm would take a long time!
She threw herself into Wuji Daoist’s arms, tears streaming uncontrollably!
“Silly child, no feast lasts forever, but I’ve found you a good husband, so I’m content.”
“Hurry up and have Chen Ping’s child, or some other woman might snatch his fine lineage first!”
Wuji Daoist laughed!
“Master, what are you saying…” Lin Keting’s face flushed!
But as she tried to say more, she realised Wuji Daoist had already turned into a golden beam and left.
The trapped immortals of the Heavenly Realm were still racing back home!
After thousands of years of waiting, every one of them was frantic!
“Son-in-law, you’re safe now, so it’s time for us five old fogeys to head back to our homes and focus on our cultivation.”
The Northern Domain Lord stepped forward, addressing Chen Ping!
