“Be careful!” Mo Qingyun exclaimed.
Chen Ping’s pupils contracted. Without time to think, he instantly raised his Dragon-Slaying Sword to block.
“Clang,”
A sharp sound rang out, like metal clashing. Lady Meixin’s fingertip struck the sword, producing a noise as if hitting diamond.
Chen Ping felt a soft yet overwhelmingly domineering force surge through the sword, numbing his arm and churning his blood.
“Hm? Interesting.”
Lady Meixin raised an eyebrow in surprise, withdrawing her finger, which was unharmed but faintly stained with blood.
“A fourth-grade Loose Immortal with such a strong physique and spiritual power? No wonder you obtained the ancient relic’s treasure.”
Lady Meixin said, astonished.
At that moment, the Mountain-Splitting Barbarian King roared and charged forward, his massive fist tearing through the air with a whistling sound, aimed at Chen Ping’s face.
Before the fist arrived, a violent force already distorted the space around Chen Ping.
“Bring it on!”
Chen Ping advanced instead of retreating, his Heart Condensation Art surging wildly, spiritual power flooding into the Dragon-Slaying Sword like a rushing river.
With a low shout, the sword turned into a dazzling white light, slashing toward the Barbarian King’s fist.
“Boom,”
A deafening collision echoed, and a violent energy shockwave spread outward from the two, forcing the scattered cultivators below to summon defensive treasures and retreat in disarray.
At the moment of impact, spiderweb-like cracks appeared in the space, and a terrifying airwave dispersed the surrounding clouds.
Chen Ping felt an unstoppable force from the sword, as if struck by a mountain. He spat out blood, his body flying backward uncontrollably.
“Chen Ping!”
Mo Qingyun screamed, rushing forward, but was blocked by a runic barrier casually cast by Old Daoist Xuanji, unable to approach.
“Hahaha! Pathetic!”
The Barbarian King laughed wildly, his eyes brimming with killing intent. “Puny ant, die!”
He raised his fist again, ready to deliver a fatal blow.
Just then, a cold glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes, and his right hand erupted in golden light.
“Holy Light Fist…”
“Boom,”
After a massive explosion, the two figures separated instantly.
The Barbarian King’s entire arm was torn open, blood gushing out.
“Such immense power…” The Barbarian King stared at Chen Ping, his expression unprecedentedly grave.
Chen Ping wasn’t faring well either. Facing two ninth-grade Loose Immortals consecutively had already injured him.
Yet, his aura showed no sign of weakening.
Dragon Power, Three Clan Power, Origin Power…
All the forces Chen Ping could muster were now fully activated. Against three ninth-grade Loose Immortals, he dared not be careless or arrogant.
“Damn, this kid’s got some skill. Let’s take him down together…”
Seeing this, Old Daoist Xuanji joined the Barbarian King and Lady Meixin, attacking Chen Ping together.
Chen Ping had no chance to counter their combined assault.
His body was struck hard, sent flying backward.
Wiping blood from his mouth, Chen Ping’s eyes burned with intense fighting spirit.
“Buzz…”
Two deep hums resounded, and a radiant light burst from the void behind Chen Ping. Two clouds of black mist emerged from his body.
Two warriors appeared, their faces ancient, wielding massive battle axes. Their bodies were covered in mysterious runes, each exuding the terrifying aura of an eighth-grade Loose Immortal.
“Hm? Battle puppets? Two eighth-grade Loose Immortal puppets?”
A trace of surprise flashed in Old Daoist Xuanji’s eyes. “Interesting. This kid does have some tricks.”
Seeing the warriors, the Barbarian King showed no fear, only greater excitement. “Perfect! Just what I need to warm up!”
