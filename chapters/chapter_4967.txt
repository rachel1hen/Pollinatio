After a moment of contemplation, Chen Ping suddenly thought of something and took out the Demon-Suppressing Tower.
The internal space of the Demon-Suppressing Tower was vast beyond measure. If he could store the immortal stone vein inside the tower, Chen Ping would have resources for cultivation within it in the future.
However, Chen Ping had never tested this before and was unsure if the Demon-Suppressing Tower could, like a storage ring, hold other items.
As Chen Ping willed it, the Demon-Suppressing Tower began to emit beams of light.
The seemingly endless immortal stone vein was, at that moment, rapidly absorbed into the tower.
In the blink of an eye, the entire immortal stone vein had been drawn into the Demon-Suppressing Tower.
Seeing his success, Chen Ping was overjoyed and hurriedly entered the tower. This time, he found that with the immortal stone vein inside, the immortal energy within the tower was extremely dense, making cultivation twice as effective with half the effort.
“Let’s go,” Chen Ping called to the Gadfly as they left the treasure land.
Before departing, Chen Ping restored the array of the treasure land, a precaution to deceive those who might enter it later.
After the two returned to the City Lord’s Mansion, Chen Ping said nothing and eagerly entered the Demon-Suppressing Tower to cultivate.
He aimed to break through to the Loose Immortal Realm as quickly as possible.
Although he was currently at the ninth rank of the Immortal Transformation Realm, there was still a fundamental difference between that and the Loose Immortal Realm.
If he could reach the Loose Immortal Realm, Chen Ping would be an invincible existence in the First Heaven of the Celestial Realm.
Inside the Demon-Suppressing Tower, Chen Ping sat cross-legged at the centre of the immortal stone vein, surrounded by immortal energy so dense it seemed tangible, pouring into his meridians like a reversed galaxy.
Time within the tower passed swiftly; while only a month elapsed outside, nearly a decade had passed inside.
Chen Ping’s robes were ravaged by the passage of time, riddled with holes, yet his eyes grew ever clearer, reflecting flowing runes.
The Heart Condensation Art frantically absorbed the immortal energy, and Chen Ping’s meridians, like parched riverbeds struck by a deluge, began to crack under the onslaught of primal energy.
Veins bulged on Chen Ping’s forehead, blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, but he suddenly bit his tongue, using his vital essence blood as a guide to forcibly channel the scattered immortal energy towards his dantian.
Chen Ping knew he had reached the critical moment to break through to the Loose Immortal Realm.
Outside, the clouds above the City Lord’s Mansion began to swirl strangely, forming a pitch-black vortex.
Lightning slithered like silver snakes within the vortex, its booming thunder causing birds within a hundred miles to plummet to the ground.
The cultivators guarding the city hurriedly summoned their magical treasures, staring at the sky in terror; this phenomenon was far more frightening than the arrival of a demon army.
Inside the Demon-Suppressing Tower, Chen Ping’s hair stood on end, and ancient Demon-Suppressing seals appeared around him.
These patterns writhed as if alive, forcibly suppressing and refining the rampant immortal energy within his body.
With a heaven-shaking roar, Chen Ping’s body erupted in dazzling golden light, piercing through the tower and soaring into the sky.
The lightning in the vortex was drawn to the golden light, striking the Demon-Suppressing Tower like a barrage of arrows, only to dissolve into specks of starlight upon contact.
“Boom!”
A tremendous sound echoed within the tower, and Chen Ping’s aura surged dramatically.
He slowly opened his eyes, their depths shimmering with star-like brilliance, exuding the unique pressure of the Loose Immortal Realm like a tidal wave.
The Demon-Suppressing Tower trembled violently, its runes glowing ever brighter, as if celebrating Chen Ping’s transformation.
Outside, the Gadfly and others gripped their weapons tightly, their hearts pounding.
He had never witnessed such a terrifying scene and silently prayed for Chen Ping.
Across the various regions of the First Heaven of the Celestial Realm, countless powerhouses turned their gazes towards Rhinoceros City, their eyes filled with shock and uncertainty.
They had no idea what kind of being could trigger such a terrifying celestial phenomenon.
