Wuwang Land, Dao Sect Main Street!
A young man clad in a mangled gold-trimmed black robe strutted boldly down the street.
Every cultivator who caught sight of him flashed a look of shock before scurrying far away.
Trailing closely behind were eight others in matching black robes, their postures rigid and straight, each one exuding the sharpness of an unsheathed sword!
Their aura was fierce and unyielding, too intense to meet head-on…
Eight Transcendent Immortal-level attendants!
Who’d dare step up to that kind of lineup?
“Young Master Ming from the Four Nether Palaces is always so flashy, makes you jealous!”
“Eight Transcendent Immortal attendants, couldn’t even dream of that in a lifetime!”
“This year’s Dao Sect is wild, Fire Incineration Sect, Sun Moon City, and now Four Nether Palaces all showing up early.”
The cultivators kept their distance, murmuring among themselves!
The youth took a couple of steps, then waved at a cultivator standing by the roadside!
This ninth-grade peak Mahayana cultivator trotted over like an eager pup, tail practically wagging!
“Young Master Ming, any orders?” the cultivator asked!
“I hear there’s a kid named Chen Ping around here, supposed to be real cocky, even cockier than me?”
Young Master Ming asked!
“No way, he’s just a third-grade Mahayana nobody, how could he compare to you, Young Master Ming?”
“You’re the real prodigy, a genius among men, a dragon among mortals…”
The cultivator piled on the flattery!
*Pfft!*
With a flick of his hand, Young Master Ming turned that ninth-grade peak Mahayana cultivator into a cloud of blood mist!
“I just want the truth, why waste time sucking up?”
Young Master Ming said coolly!
The surrounding cultivators froze in horror, this guy’s temper was a wildcard, one slip and you’re done!
“You, come here…”
Young Master Ming pointed casually at another cultivator!
The poor guy shuffled over, shaking like a leaf, face tight with nerves!
“No need to be scared, I’m not gonna eat you!”
“No need to be scared, I’m not gonna eat you!”
Young Master Ming flashed a faint smile, then asked, “Tell me, is this Chen Ping guy really that cocky?”
“Yeah, Chen Ping’s super cocky, he publicly offed the Qian Sect’s third elder with one sword, shouting about taking on anyone who dared challenge him…”
The cultivator blurted out in a rush!
“Cockier than me?” Young Master Ming blinked, caught off guard!
The cultivator hesitated, unsure how to respond!
“I’m asking you a question, and you dare not answer?”
Young Master Ming’s face darkened, and with a sudden slap, he unleashed a palm strike!
That strike carried endless malice, slamming the cultivator into the ground, flesh vanishing, leaving only a pile of stark white bones, utterly chilling!
“Young Master Ming, this is the Dao Sect, don’t you think you’re going too far?”
At that moment, a man and a woman stepped forward.
Both wore fiery red cloaks.
“Wenshi, Wenqing, you siblings looking to meddle in my business?”
Seeing them, Young Master Ming sneered coldly!
“You Four Nether Palaces are part of the Dao Sect’s management too, you’re out here killing randomly and causing panic, you gonna take responsibility for that?”
“And all of us sects and families with management rights here have a duty to stop you!”
Wenshi said sternly, his face grim!
“Quit playing saint in front of me, like you’ve never killed anyone.”
“That Chen Ping guy killed someone in the Dao Sect too, publicly, why aren’t you hassling him?”
“Get lost, don’t bug me, I’m off to find that Chen Ping, acting all high and mighty in the Dao Sect, outshining me? I won’t stand for it!”
Young Master Ming didn’t give Wenshi an inch, waving him off!
A cold glint flashed in Wenshi’s eyes, “Young Master Ming, you can strut around in front of others, but in front of our Fire Incineration Sect, you don’t get to play tough, do you?”
With that, Wenshi’s words dropped, and the Fire Incineration Sect members behind him unleashed their auras in unison!
Young Master Ming didn’t flinch, “Wenshi, don’t think I don’t know, your dad’s injured and in seclusion, still hasn’t come out.”
“Without him, you and your sister are nothing, so get the hell out of my way!”
Young Master Ming waved impatiently!
