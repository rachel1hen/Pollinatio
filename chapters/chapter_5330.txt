He did not rush to display his speed. Instead, he spread out his divine sense like an invisible large net, carefully probing the surrounding movements. Only then did he take a step forward. His figure resembled a ghostly golden light as he directly stepped into the depths of the Black Wind Mountain Range.
The visibility in the miasma was extremely low. Beyond three zhang, everything was a blur; one could only vaguely see the outlines of trees.
From time to time, the roars of demonic beasts came to his ears, sometimes low like thunder, sometimes sharp like a whistle. They were mixed with some faint, eerie whispers, as if countless resentful souls were peeking from the shadows.
Chen Ping concentrated and stayed alert. He quietly executed the Fire Control Step under his feet. As his figure shuttled through the forest, he made almost no sound; only the occasional light crack of stepping on dry branches was quickly covered by the surrounding noise.
His gaze was as sharp as an eagle’s. Even in the dim environment, he could capture the slightest movements.
Before long, a faint fluctuation of spiritual power entered his perception. Chen Ping paused his steps and quietly hid in the crown of a towering ancient tree. Through the gaps in the branches and leaves, he looked down and saw a simple yet heavily guarded camp hidden in the valley not far away.
Dozens of Evil Path Hall cultivators dressed in black robes were drilling in the camp. They wielded bone blades made from demonic beast bones; dense black qi lingered on the bone blades. Each slash brought a piercing sound of breaking through the air.
These cultivators had ferocious expressions on their faces; their eyes flickered with bloodthirsty red light. Evil qi swirled around their bodies; clearly, they had cultivated the evil techniques of the Evil Path Hall.
In the centre of the camp, an altar piled up from countless skull heads was particularly eye-catching.
The altar was about three zhang high. Ghostly green light flickered in the eye sockets of the skulls; at the top of the altar, a dense mass of green mist swirled without dispersing.
Looking closely, countless incomplete illusory shadows were struggling and roaring in the green mist. Upon closer inspection, they were all imprisoned divine souls!
“Humph.”
Murderous intent surged in Chen Ping’s eyes; the golden light around his body suddenly became several degrees more intense.
Among these divine souls, there were no shortage of cultivators’ auras; clearly, they had been killed by the Evil Path Hall cultivators, who then forcibly extracted their divine souls to cultivate evil arts.
He hesitated no longer. His figure suddenly accelerated like an arrow released from the string, shooting out from the tree crown. The Dragon Slaying Sword cut through the air, bringing a sharp and unmatched golden sword qi.
“Chi!”
The sword qi was as fast as lightning; in an instant, it pierced the throats of three black-robed cultivators who had their backs to him.
Those three did not even have time to turn around; their bodies stiffened. Then, they turned into strands of black qi and dissipated into the air, leaving only three withered corpses like mummies, which fell heavily to the ground.
“There’s an intruder!”
The cultivators in the camp became alert instantly and turned their heads to look.
When they saw the golden light on Chen Ping’s body, which was completely opposite to the evil qi, a flash of fear appeared in their eyes first, followed immediately by greed.
“It’s a righteous path cultivator! Capture him alive!” A cultivator who seemed to be the leader shouted sternly. “His divine soul is so pure; it will surely greatly nourish the altar!”
Dozens of black-robed cultivators pounced at the same time; their bone blades carried dense evil qi, aiming straight for Chen Ping’s vital points. Their formation was chaotic yet fierce; combined with the evil qi pervading the camp, it formed a heart-palpitating sense of oppression.
Chen Ping snorted coldly; the divine dragon power in his body erupted suddenly. Blazing golden flames instantly ignited on the Dragon Slaying Sword.
“Ignorant of death.” His voice was as cold as ice. His figure flickered like a ghost as he rushed into the crowd.
The Dragon Slaying Sword swept out horizontally; the golden flames spread like a tide. Wherever they passed, the screams of the black-robed cultivators rose one after another.
Those seemingly domineering evil qis melted away like ice and snow under the scorching sun in the face of the golden flames.
One cultivator’s bone blade was just about to slash in front of Chen Ping when it was burned by the flames with a “sizzle” sound. It then broke inch by inch; the flames took advantage and spread to his body. In the blink of an eye, it turned him into a charred corpse.
