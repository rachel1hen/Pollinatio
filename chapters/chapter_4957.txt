Chen Ping was startled upon hearing this, relieved that he hadn’t revealed too much in the Purgatory Arena, only exposing the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda.
Items like the Divine King Bow, Dragon-Patterned Bell, or Demon-Whipping Lash, he hadn’t taken out.
Nor had he revealed the Fire Qilin or the Heaven-Devouring Beast. If those had been exposed, it would have been catastrophic.
“You can cultivate inside the pagoda, but there are no resources within it. To train there, you must bring enough resources,” Chen Ping said.
Although a year outside the pagoda equated to a century inside, one needed resources for a century, or staying there for a hundred years would be pointless.
“Don’t worry about resources, Big Brother. The resources of Rhino City are at your disposal, and I’ll bring plenty myself,” the Gadfly replied.
As city lord, his access to resources was unmatched.
“As long as you have resources, I don’t mind,” Chen Ping said nonchalantly.
“Thank you, Big Brother. A toast to you!” The Gadfly raised his cup and downed it.
Seeing this, Bai Yi spoke up to the Gadfly, “City Lord, I have a request, if I may?”
“Speak,” the Gadfly said.
Bai Yi explained the situation with Rhino City’s black market. He wanted to consolidate it and bring all the black markets under his control.
The Gadfly nodded in agreement. “No problem. I’ll assign a squad of battle soldiers to you. If anyone resists, deal with them directly.”
“I’ll also legitimise the black market, so you won’t have to operate in secret anymore.”
“Thank you, City Lord!” Bai Yi stood quickly, raising a toast to the Gadfly.
“Uncle, you’re Big Brother’s father-in-law, and this Old Gadfly is a junior. He should call you uncle and toast you first,” the Mad Immortal reminded Bai Yi.
Hearing that Bai Yi was Chen Ping’s father-in-law, the Gadfly hurriedly stood. “Uncle, a toast to you! From now on, Rhino City’s black market will belong to you alone!”
The banquet was lively, and the Gadfly invited Chen Ping and his group to stay at the city lord’s mansion.
After all, the conditions there were far better than outside.
That night, the Gadfly brought a large amount of resources and followed Chen Ping into the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda.
Cultivating one night in the pagoda was equivalent to dozens of days, an exhilarating prospect.
But while Chen Ping and the Gadfly were cultivating in the pagoda, inside Rhino City’s Tianbao Pavilion, dozens of grey-clad figures gathered.
Their leader was none other than the pavilion’s manager.
In his hand, he held a token, the very one Chen Ping had pawned.
“Tonight, we must succeed, no failures. With this token, we can easily enter the city lord’s mansion.”
“If we can capture the city lord’s daughter and son, we can force the Gadfly to comply.”
“If we succeed, every one of us will be a hero. The city lord won’t forget us. For years, Rhino City has monopolised the Purgatory Arena, amassing vast immortal coins.”
“Moreover, Rhino City has far more resource-rich lands than we do. Flying Tiger City is on the brink of collapse. This is our make-or-break moment,” the Tianbao Pavilion manager rallied the group.
It turned out this manager was the head of Flying Tiger City’s spies, having infiltrated Rhino City for years and risen to this position.
No one would suspect him of being a Flying Tiger City spy.
This was why he was willing to trade ten thousand immortal coins for Chen Ping’s token and then sealed it to keep Niu Li from noticing.
“Kill, kill, kill…” The dozens of Flying Tiger City spies, their eyes blazing with murderous intent.
For years, Rhino City and Flying Tiger City had clashed repeatedly over resources.
It wasn’t just the three clans that fought; conflicts existed within the same clan too. From ancient times to now, disputes were driven by profit, and even in the Heavenly Realm, among immortals, this reality remained unchanged.
