“It’s… it’s them!”
In the distance, a white-haired cultivator suddenly let out a piercing scream, his voice filled with incredulous fear, “Xuanjizi, the old Taoist from Tianyan Sect! And the ‘Mountain-Splitting’ Barbarian King from the Ancient Barbarian Tribe! And… Lady ‘Charmheart’ from the Blood Shadow Palace!”
“My God! Why would these three appear together? They’re all ninth-rank Loose Immortals, figures who can shake the heavens and earth in the Triple Heaven with a single step!”
“It’s over, it’s over, Chen Ping is doomed! The ancient ruin’s treasure has drawn these three fiends!”
“It’s said that Old Taoist Xuanjizi excels at divining the secrets of the heavens, he probably foresaw Chen Ping had the treasure long ago; the Barbarian King is bloodthirsty and loves seizing treasures; and Lady Charmheart’s methods are sinister, countless experts have died under her bell…”
The murmurs spread like a tide, everyone looking at Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun with pity and fear, as if they were already prey in the grasp of these three titans.
Hearing the crowd’s discussions, Chen Ping’s frown deepened. He hadn’t expected the news of the ancient ruin’s treasure to attract the top powerhouses of the Triple Heaven.
Mo Qingyun’s body trembled slightly, clearly feeling the three mountain-like, oppressive auras, each far surpassing the old man in black from before.
She instinctively shrank behind Chen Ping, her fingertips tightly clutching his sleeve, her eyes full of worry, “Chen Ping…”
Chen Ping took a deep breath, shielding Mo Qingyun behind him, his Dragon-Slaying Sword held across his chest, its blade glinting coldly in the sunlight.
Looking at the three titans before him, he knew today’s battle was unavoidable.
Old Taoist Xuanjizi spoke first, his voice raspy like a broken gong, yet clear in everyone’s ears, “Little one, hand over the ancient ruin’s treasure, and I might leave you an intact corpse.”
His gaze fell on Chen Ping, as if looking at a dead man, his calm demeanour suggesting Chen Ping’s resistance was futile.
The Barbarian King let out an impatient growl, his voice like a booming bell, shaking the void, “Why waste words on him? Just take it! I want to see what a fourth-rank Loose Immortal ant is capable of!”
The scars on his body began to glow red, his muscles bulging, clearly ready to strike.
Lady Charmheart gave a sweet giggle, her voice so sugary it could melt bones, yet her words carried a chilling edge, “Little brother, why be so stubborn? Give the treasure to your big sister, and she’ll take good care of you…”
As she spoke, she gently shook her blood-red bell, sending invisible sound waves toward Chen Ping, attempting to disrupt his mind.
Chen Ping’s eyes sharpened, his internal spiritual energy surging, instantly blocking the seductive sound.
He looked at the three with an expressionless face and said gravely, “You three must be mistaken, I don’t have any ancient ruin’s treasure. I’m just a humble cultivator, why would such esteemed seniors trouble a junior like me?”
“Hmph!”
Old Taoist Xuanjizi snorted coldly, his eyes flashing with brilliance, “Little one, playing tricks in front of me? You think your petty schemes can fool us? Your image has already spread across the Triple Heaven, do you take me for a blind man?”
The Barbarian King was even more direct, taking a fierce step forward, causing the entire space to shake violently. He roared, “Enough nonsense! Hand it over, or I’ll crush you into pulp!”
Lady Charmheart shook her head with a coy smile, “Little brother, it seems you won’t shed tears until you see the coffin… In that case, your big sister will have to search you herself.”
As she spoke, her figure blurred, turning into a red shadow. In an instant, she appeared before Chen Ping, her slender fingers, carrying a sickly sweet fragrance, aiming straight for his forehead.
