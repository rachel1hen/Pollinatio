After the assistant took the token, his eyes widened instantly, appearing somewhat surprised as he said, “Where did you get this token from?”
The assistant’s tone was somewhat stern, which immediately annoyed Chen Ping!
“Why should you care how I got it? Just tell me if it can be exchanged for money.”
Chen Ping said coldly!
“Then wait a moment!” After speaking, the assistant handed the token back to Chen Ping and hurriedly walked towards the back!
Not long after, a middle-aged man in a grey robe came out. Upon seeing Chen Ping and his two companions, he smiled broadly and said, “I’m the shopkeeper here. Please, come inside, you three!”
Seeing that the shopkeeper was relatively polite, Chen Ping and his companions followed him inside!
But who would have known, just as they entered the room, Chen Ping sensed that an array was instantly activated around the room!
Chen Ping frowned and immediately reached out to grab the shopkeeper!
Suddenly activating an array was definitely not a good sign!
But the shopkeeper’s figure vanished instantly, only to reappear behind Chen Ping and his companions!
Hu Mazi and Xiu Rui also reacted, both turning around and attacking the shopkeeper!
However, the shopkeeper pressed his palm down, and an overwhelming pressure instantly filled the room!
Chen Ping, Hu Mazi, and the others felt as if ten thousand mountains were pressing down on them, completely unable to move!
“What do you want?” Chen Ping asked, looking at the shopkeeper!
“I’m asking you, where did this token come from?”
The shopkeeper asked sternly, no longer showing the politeness from earlier!
“Someone gave it to me!” Chen Ping said!
“Who gave it to you?”
The shopkeeper pressed further!
“Niu Li, I think she’s the princess of this Rhino City,” Chen Ping answered.
Upon hearing the name Niu Li, the shopkeeper lightly waved his hand, and the pressure in the room instantly vanished!
“How much do you plan to pawn this token for?” the shopkeeper asked!
“Ten thousand immortal coins.”
Chen Ping said after a moment of thought!
Since the shopkeeper had withdrawn the pressure and softened his attitude after hearing Niu Li’s name, it seemed that the princess’s name carried significant weight!
“Don’t mess around, asking for so much, will they even give it?” Hu Mazi gently tugged at Chen Ping’s sleeve and said.
Xiu Rui also felt that Chen Ping was asking for too much, thinking they definitely wouldn’t agree.
After all, two women were worth only five hundred immortal coins. With ten thousand immortal coins, how many women could that buy?
“Not too much.” Surprisingly, the shopkeeper didn’t hesitate at all. After speaking, he tossed a storage pouch to Chen Ping.
Chen Ping was stunned, looking at the storage pouch in his hand in disbelief.
He hadn’t expected the other party to agree so readily. To think that such a small token was worth so much, he should have asked for more.
“Damn, I asked for too little.”
Chen Ping was extremely regretful at this moment, but regret was useless.
“The pawn period is ten days. If you don’t redeem it within ten days, the item will belong to our Tianbao Pavilion.”
The shopkeeper said.
“No problem!” Chen Ping nodded, then left with Hu Mazi and Xiu Rui.
Seeing how delighted Chen Ping and his companions were, the shopkeeper’s lips curled slightly.
“Shopkeeper, these guys probably won’t redeem the token, right?”
The assistant asked the shopkeeper.
“They won’t. They don’t even know the token’s true value, or they wouldn’t have pawned it.”
“The princess’s token, given to someone who just arrived through the Great Dao, that’s quite interesting.”
The shopkeeper’s eyes narrowed slightly, a trace of puzzlement in his gaze.
Then, the shopkeeper took out an exquisitely crafted wooden box and placed the token inside.
He forced out a drop of essence blood, letting it drip onto the wooden box, and the entire box instantly glowed with an eerie red light.
Meanwhile, as Chen Ping and his companions left Tianbao Pavilion, the big man was still waiting outside. Seeing Chen Ping come out, he hurriedly asked, “Did you exchange it for immortal coins?”
