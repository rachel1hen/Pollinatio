“Clang, clang, clang…”
A barrage of attacks rained down on Chen Ping, producing a deafening clang like striking metal and stone, sparks flying in all directions.
Yet, Chen Ping stood unmoved, the golden scales on his body untouched by even a single scratch. The ferocious attacks seemed to vanish like mud into the sea, completely nullified by his impervious golden form.
“How is this possible?”
The Grand Elder’s pupils contracted sharply, his face filled with disbelief. “So many full-force strikes from sixth- and seventh-grade Loose Immortal Realm cultivators, and… and they couldn’t even harm him in the slightest?”
At this moment, the Grand Elder began to believe that perhaps their Barbarian King had truly been killed by the Chen Ping standing before them!
Chen Ping had no patience to waste time with these insignificant ants. His gaze turned cold, and he flicked his fingers repeatedly.
“Zheng! Zheng! Zheng!”
Several invisible sword intents shot out like lightning, even sharper than when he had slain Black Impermanence earlier!
The barbarian powerhouses charging at the forefront didn’t even have time to scream before their heads were severed, rolling to the ground, their eyes still frozen in ferocious expressions.
“This… this is sword intent?”
A wild-haired Second Elder was utterly horrified. “Such terrifying sword intent, I’m afraid… I’m afraid even the peak of the Loose Immortal Realm couldn’t achieve this, could it?”
The Grand Elder’s face turned ashen. He finally realised that the seemingly young man before them was a terrifying existence far beyond their reach!
Killing the Mountain-Splitting Barbarian King, slaying several Loose Immortal Realm powerhouses with a snap of his fingers—this level of strength had likely surpassed the Loose Immortal Realm and reached the Earth Immortal Realm!
To achieve Earth Immortal strength at such a young age was simply outrageous!
“Retreat! Retreat now!” the Grand Elder roared, trying to command his clan to fall back.
But would Chen Ping give them the chance?
In a flash, his figure appeared before the Grand Elder like a phantom.
The Grand Elder’s pupils shrank. Instinctively, he summoned the ancient Barbarian Clan’s treasured artefact—a black shield engraved with ancient totems, exuding a heavy, ancient aura. This was the “Barbarian Guardian Shield,” said to withstand a full-force strike from a peak Loose Immortal Realm cultivator.
“Bang!”
Chen Ping didn’t even use his Dragon-Slaying Sword, merely throwing a casual punch.
The golden fist imprint carried an earth-shattering momentum, smashing fiercely into the Barbarian Guardian Shield.
With a “crack,” the supposedly indestructible shield was instantly covered in web-like fractures, followed by a “boom” as it shattered into countless fragments!
The Grand Elder was horror-stricken. His protective aura erupted instantly, attempting to block the punch.
But Chen Ping’s fist was unstoppable, easily piercing through his aura and slamming into his chest.
“Pfft…”
The Grand Elder flew backwards like a kite with a broken string, crashing through half a city wall. He spat out a mouthful of blood, his organs shattered, clearly beyond saving.
“Grand Elder!”
“Clan Leader!”
Seeing this, the Barbarian Clan fell into complete panic. If even the Grand Elder was killed in a single move, what chance did they have to resist?
“Run!!”
Someone shouted, and the remaining barbarian powerhouses, no longer caring about revenge, turned to flee.
“Trying to escape?”
Chen Ping’s gaze was icy as he waved his hand.
“Hum…”
An invisible domain instantly enveloped the entire Barbarian City.
The fleeing barbarian powerhouses felt their bodies sink, as if crushed by a mountain of immense weight, unable to move.
They discovered in terror that their cultivation was suppressed to the extreme within this domain, making even lifting a hand incredibly difficult.
This was Chen Ping’s comprehension of the Origin of Time. Though not yet perfected, it was more than enough to suppress these ants below the Loose Immortal Realm.
Within the domain Chen Ping had created, everything was under his control.
“Chen Ping, let us have a bit of fun too!” Hu Mazi rubbed his hands, his eyes gleaming with excitement.
Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun, meanwhile, calmly took out their storage bags, ready to collect the spoils.
