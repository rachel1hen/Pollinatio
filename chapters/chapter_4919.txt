“You’re also cultivators from the Wuxu Realm?” Xiu Rui said, his face full of shock, then excitedly added, “I’m from the Wuxu Realm too.”
“You’re from the Wuxu Realm as well?” The two women were equally astonished and asked, “What’s your name?”
After all, not many from the same world were chosen by the Great Dao, so a name would likely be familiar.
“I’m Xiu Rui,” Xiu Rui replied.
“Senior Xiu?” The two women were shocked again. “Weren’t you chosen by the Great Dao hundreds of years ago? There are still legends about you in the Wuxu Realm. We sisters have always looked up to you.”
“Why are you still here after all these years?”
Hearing this, Xiu Rui immediately felt embarrassed. He couldn’t exactly admit that he’d been thrown into prison right after arriving!
After all, he was supposed to be an idol.
“Friend Xiu has a mission here, mediating disputes between the three clans, so he hasn’t left all these years,” Chen Ping said, quickly coming to Xiu Rui’s rescue upon seeing his awkwardness.
Chen Ping hadn’t expected that Xiu Rui was such a big deal in the Wuxu Realm, even becoming a legend.
“Senior Xiu is truly amazing,” the two women said, looking at Xiu Rui with admiration.
“Alright, let’s not talk here. Let’s find a place to stay first,” Chen Ping said.
After all, the two women were only in their undergarments, and standing on the street wasn’t proper.
“There’s an inn not far ahead,” one of the women said.
“How do you know?” Hu Mazi asked curiously.
The woman’s face reddened, and she lowered her head, saying, “We were captured and kept in that inn to serve the big man. After he’d had enough, he decided to sell us.”
Looking at the two women, it was somewhat pitiful. They had once been queens, now reduced to playthings.
“Let’s go, to the inn…” Hu Mazi urged, growing impatient.
“Friend Chen, thank you just now,” Xiu Rui said gratefully to Chen Ping on the way to the inn.
“No big deal. Remember, when you’re out here, your status is what you make it. No one knows the truth anyway.”
“Can’t you brag a little?” Chen Ping said with a faint smile.
The group arrived at the inn. The inn’s assistant merely glanced at them before arranging rooms for Chen Ping and his companions.
Chen Ping was now wealthy, so they booked luxurious rooms.
Each room was equipped with arrays to aid cultivation.
After settling the rooms, Hu Mazi eagerly headed towards the women’s rooms.
“Master Hu…” Xiu Rui called out, stopping him.
“What? You want one of them?” Hu Mazi asked.
“No, no!” Xiu Rui shook his head. “Master Hu, these two women are from my world. Please, for my sake, go easy on them…”
“Damn, no matter how rough I am, could I be worse than that big guy?” Hu Mazi said, exasperated, before walking into the room.
Xiu Rui thought about it and realised it was true. If the two women could handle the big man, serving Hu Mazi would be a breeze!
Soon, shouts and cries came from the women’s rooms!
Annoyed by the noise, Chen Ping entered the Demon-Suppressing Tower to cultivate.
…
Rhino City, City Lord’s Mansion!
In a towering palace, City Lord Niu Meng sat on a grand dragon throne, his expression grave!
Below him stood two rows of Rhino City’s high-ranking officials, all with furrowed brows!
“Great Elder, have we still not caught the spies from Feihu City?” City Lord Niu Meng asked.
“City Lord, I’ve increased the patrols of the war soldier teams, and the entire City Lord’s Mansion is under heightened security. Without a token, no unauthorised personnel are allowed to enter,” the Great Elder hurriedly replied.
“This Feihu City keeps trying to seize our city. They’ve gone too far. Sooner or later, I’ll wipe them out.”
Niu Meng gritted his teeth and smashed his fist onto the table in front of him, reducing it to dust in an instant.
