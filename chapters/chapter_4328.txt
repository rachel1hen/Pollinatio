“Don’t let them escape, kill ……”
Seeing this, Patriarch Jiang immediately roared out and led the crowd from the Soul Demon Sect towards the disciples of the Blood and Bone Sect!
The Broad Cold Palace Palace Master also brought the Holy Daughter of Broad Cold Palace along to chase and kill them!
Chen Ping was frowning slightly, carefully looking at the fleeing Di Chong Jing, this guy was only a first grade of the Mahayana realm, he was still his own defeated opponent, obviously not a match anymore, but he didn’t even run away, he even fled towards the inside of the main hall!
This is not letting them catch a turtle in a jar? Could it be that there was something strange or some secret passage or teleportation array or something like that in that big hall?
Just as Chen Ping was hesitating, Di Chong Jing had already rushed into the great hall with her people, while Patriarch Jiang and the others also chased after them with their people!
“Don’t chase, don’t go into that great hall ……”
Seeing this, Chen Ping hurriedly gave a loud reminder!
However, Chen Ping was too late to remind him, Patriarch Jiang had already rushed into the great hall with the Soul Demon Sect’s people!
When Di Chongjing saw that Patriarch Jiang had rushed in with his men, the corners of his mouth lifted and his eyes were filled with smugness!
“Senior brother, you’re such a fool to chase after me, since you want me to die so badly, then I’ll be impolite!”
After Di Chongjing finished speaking, he unexpectedly pulled out a token from his pocket and crushed it!
Along with the token shattering, a blood-red aura instantly filled the great hall!
“Di Chongjing, don’t forget that we’re fellow disciples, it’s simply impossible for you to use this blood mist against me!”
Patriarch Jiang wasn’t afraid at all, after all, these blood mists, Patriarch Jiang also had a way to crack them!
“Hahaha, senior brother, you’re too naive, are you looking at this blood mist you can crack?”
Di Chong Jing laughed out loud, soon some dark green aura even emerged from that blood mist, and soon Patriarch Jiang and the others were enveloped!
Seeing this, Patriarch Jiang hurriedly took out a token and crushed it as well, these were passed down from their master!
However, after Patriarch Jiang’s token was crushed, the blood mist mixed with the dark green aura did not dissipate!
When Patriarch Jiang saw this, his face changed!
“It’s cold, it’s too cold ……”
Some of the Soul Demon Sect’s disciples began to shiver!
The temperature of the entire hall was dropping rapidly, and the Yin Fiendish Qi continued to rise around them!
Di Chongjing, with the people from the Blood and Bone Sect, had long since disappeared, only their voices could be heard, but no one could be seen at all!
“Don’t panic everyone, let’s exit ……”
Patriarch Jiang knew that he could only exit now before saying anything, perhaps Chen Ping would be able to break through these blood mists!
But Patriarch Jiang led his people to keep retreating, but he found that he could not find an exit at all!
“Senior brother, don’t bother, you won’t be able to get out at all, this is the Evil Ghost Formation that Senior Brother and Second Brother invited someone to set up, in conjunction with the Blood Fiend Token given by Master, it’s simply perfect, you won’t be able to escape!”
After Di Chong Jing let out a cold laugh, a sinister wind then blew by!
The surrounding blood mist violently tumbled up as if it was boiling boiling water, and it constantly began to shake, the entire void trembling along with it!
As for Patriarch Jiang and the others, they felt a hellish fear and pressure!
At this moment, they all felt like they were in hell, surrounded by countless evil spirits!
Soon, the dark green aura within that blood mist began to continuously coalesce, and then turned into a gigantic ghost monster!
There were dozens of ghosts and monsters, and their bodies were covered in hair, like green-haired people!
The appearance of these ghosts and monsters instantly made the Soul Demon Sect’s crowd fearful!
But there was no escape, and they could only face it!
“Don’t be afraid, all of you, these are just bluffs, Mr Chen must be out there trying to save us!”
After Patriarch Jiang finished speaking, he led the crowd of the Soul Demon Sect towards those green-haired ghosts and monsters to kill them!
However, when the fights were exchanged, the crowd realised that these ghosts and monsters were not only highly powerful, but also very difficult to deal with!
