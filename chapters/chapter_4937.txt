Bao Hu clearly had reservations and didn’t dare to use his magical aura, fearing detection by the battle troop above.
If they discovered the location of his black market, his life would be over.
“Be careful!” Hu Mazi exclaimed, his face instantly pale.
Chen Ping, however, had anticipated this, a cold smirk curling his lips.
The moment the dagger nearly touched his clothing, he seized Bao Hu’s wrist, giving it a gentle squeeze.
“Ah!”
Bao Hu let out a pig-like scream as the bones in his wrist were crushed to powder, his arm hanging limply.
The dagger clattered to the ground, its venom corroding a small, smoking pit.
“This is just a lesson. In the future, accept your loss and don’t resort to sneak attacks.”
Chen Ping spoke coldly, then kicked Bao Hu, sending him flying. Bao Hu soared over ten metres like a tattered sack, crashing heavily to the ground.
The entire black market fell silent, everyone stunned by the shocking scene.
Who could have imagined that a seemingly ordinary young man could dominate the entire Bao Hu Gang with just physical strength?
The thugs, usually so arrogant, were as fragile as infants before him.
Bao Hu’s face was ashen, his eyes filled with unwillingness, yet he dared not resist.
He knew he had no chance of fighting back against Chen Ping.
With no other choice, he ordered Nuo Qing to bring out all the immortal coins and resources.
Bai Yi, looking at the mountain of immortal coins and resources, grinned from ear to ear.
He stepped forward, patted Chen Ping’s shoulder, and praised, “My dear son-in-law, you’re truly incredible! With you, our Spirit Fox Gang’s status in the black market will surely soar!”
Chen Ping gave a faint smile, saying nothing. He knew that in this realm where strength reigned supreme, only by constantly improving could one stand firm.
Today’s victory was only due to the rules’ restrictions. If magical auras were allowed, Chen Ping wouldn’t stand a chance against these opponents, so he needed to advance his realm quickly.
The Bao Hu Gang watched as their hard-earned wealth was taken by Chen Ping. Though reluctant, they dared not protest.
They knew that from this moment, the Bao Hu Gang’s standing in the black market would plummet.
“Father-in-law, shall we visit another black market?” Chen Ping asked.
Only by winning more immortal coins and resources could Chen Ping advance faster.
“No problem, let’s go,” Bai Yi replied, brimming with excitement. After casting a cold glance at Bao Hu, he left the Bao Hu Gang.
As they exited, Nuo Qing and the others from the Spirit Fox Gang looked at Chen Ping with admiration.
The Spirit Fox Gang had previously lost many immortal coins and resources to the Bao Hu Gang, making survival difficult. Now, they’d won it all back.
Initially, Nuo Qing had looked down on Chen Ping, with his slight build and mere First Rank Immortal Transformation cultivation.
If he weren’t Bai Yi’s son-in-law, Nuo Qing probably wouldn’t have bothered with him.
But now, Nuo Qing and the others called him “young master” with warmth and affection.
Bai Yi grew even fonder of Chen Ping, calling him “dear son-in-law” repeatedly along the way.
Bai Yi led Chen Ping to sweep through various black markets.
Because of Chen Ping’s unassuming appearance, others saw him as an easy target.
At every black market, they assumed Chen Ping would lose and bet heavily against him.
The results were predictable: Chen Ping won every time, collecting heaps of immortal coins.
Though the black markets lost many immortal coins, they were helpless. They didn’t dare act.
If they refused to pay or attacked Chen Ping’s group, their market’s reputation would be ruined.
A black market without credibility was doomed; no one would do business there.
More importantly, using magical auras would leak energy, alerting the patrolling battle troop.
Once a black market’s location was exposed, it was finished. The city lord’s mansion would surely send troops to destroy it.
