But just as Chen Ping leaped out of the crater, a wave of extreme danger suddenly washed over him!
Chen Ping quickly turned and swung his sword, only to find no one behind him.
Thud!
In the split second Chen Ping was distracted, a sharp blade pierced through his back.
“This…”
Chen Ping stared at the blade protruding from his chest, momentarily stunned.
With his Indestructible Golden Body and his incredibly strong physique, who could have so easily pierced through his body?
“It’s over, it’s over…”
The Red Cloud Demon Lord sighed in frustration.
Chen Ping’s body was broken, and he could no longer possess it.
“Mr. Chen…”
Hua Yueying, Xuan Bin, and the others were frantic when they saw Chen Ping had been ambushed.
If Chen Ping died, their desperate struggle against the Tenth Hall would be meaningless.
Chen Ping was their golden goose—he couldn’t die!
Lin Kefan, seeing this, was furious. “You dare ambush my brother-in-law? I’ll wipe out your entire clan!”
Ignoring his own injuries, Lin Kefan rushed to Chen Ping’s side.
But just as everyone was rushing toward Chen Ping, a dragon’s roar echoed from within his body. The dragon crystal on his chest began to glow, and a golden dragon slowly emerged from Chen Ping’s body.
The wounds on Chen Ping’s body healed at a visible rate, and the cracks in his Indestructible Golden Body were completely repaired.
The golden dragon coiled around Chen Ping, its dragon aura enveloping him.
Everyone who saw this was utterly shocked.
Whether it was Lin Kefan or Xuan Bin and the others, none of them had expected a golden dragon to emerge from Chen Ping’s body.
Not far from Chen Ping, an old man, faintly visible, also wore an expression of surprise and confusion.
This old man was the one who had ambushed Chen Ping—the “Elder Qian” mentioned by the Tenth Hall Master, a figure of even higher status than the Hall Master himself.
“The Tenth Hall still has reinforcements? This is going to be troublesome…”
Xuan Bin’s expression turned grave as he looked at the appearing Elder Qian.
The Tenth Hall Master, seeing Elder Qian, bowed respectfully. “I apologize for disturbing your meditation, Elder Qian. I hope you won’t hold it against me.”
Even in his beast-transformed state, the Tenth Hall Master didn’t dare show the slightest disrespect toward Elder Qian.
Elder Qian, however, ignored the Tenth Hall Master and instead stared intently at Chen Ping. “No wonder… no wonder I couldn’t divine your origins…”
Chen Ping also glared at Elder Qian. “Old bastard, was it you who ambushed me just now?”
“That wasn’t an ambush. I simply predicted your position,” Elder Qian replied with a faint smile.
“Predict my ass…” Lin Kefan cursed and threw a punch.
In the sky, several bolts of lightning descended, crashing toward Elder Qian.
But just as the lightning was about to strike, Elder Qian’s body vanished into thin air.
When everyone could see clearly again, Elder Qian had moved from his original position. With just a single, effortless step, he had dodged Lin Kefan’s attack.
Lin Kefan was stunned and immediately threw several more punches. This time, over a dozen bolts of lightning rained down, enveloping Elder Qian.
He wanted to see how Elder Qian could possibly dodge this.
But to everyone’s shock, Elder Qian weaved through the dozen bolts of lightning, using the time difference between them to avoid being hit by even a single strike.
Lin Kefan was dumbfounded.
Not just Lin Kefan—everyone was dumbfounded.
Even Chen Ping stared at Elder Qian in disbelief, his eyes filled with astonishment.
Chen Ping couldn’t understand how this guy had dodged the attacks.
If it were just a matter of speed, it would be impossible to dodge over a dozen lightning bolts in such a confined space.
“I didn’t expect a place like the Tenth Hall to have someone who has mastered the art of divination,” the Red Cloud Demon Lord remarked.
“Divination?” Chen Ping was puzzled. “Senior, what is divination?”
“It’s the ability to predict future events. Things that haven’t happened yet, he can foresee,” the Red Cloud Demon Lord explained. “Earlier, when he said he predicted your position, he used divination to know what you were going to do next.”
“That’s also why he could easily dodge attacks. He already knew what you were going to do, so he was prepared in advance!”
