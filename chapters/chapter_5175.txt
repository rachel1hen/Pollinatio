“Senior Crimson Cloud, thank you this time,” Chen Ping said softly.
After a moment’s silence, the languid voice of the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord echoed in his mind. “Kid, don’t get too cocky. Those two old geezers were just small fry. An organisation that can send out such characters surely has far more powerful old monsters behind it. With your current cultivation, you’d still have to run if you met them.”
A faint smile curled Chen Ping’s lips. “Run? The word ‘flee’ doesn’t exist in my dictionary.”
“Pfft, all you do is brag. Without my help these past few times, you’d have died long ago if you didn’t escape!”
The Crimson Cloud Demon Lord didn’t hold back in calling him out.
Chen Ping gave an awkward chuckle, his figure flashing as he transformed into a streak of golden light, exiting the Demon-Suppressing Tower and landing in the stone chamber.
“Chen Ping!” Huo Jingjing saw the stone door open and rushed forward. Seeing his vibrant appearance, her anxious heart finally settled, though her eyes reddened involuntarily. “You scared me to death!”
Mo Qingyun also dashed over, the two girls clinging tightly to Chen Ping, heedless of others’ gazes.
These past few days, they had been genuinely worried about his injuries.
The Seventh Hall Master followed closely, sensing the Sixth Rank Loose Immortal aura emanating from Chen Ping. His eyes nearly popped out. “Just a few days? You… you broke through?”
Advancing a single rank in the Loose Immortal Realm was like scaling the heavens. Ordinary cultivators might spend a decade or more without touching the threshold. Yet Chen Ping, while gravely injured, had leapt two ranks. This cultivation speed utterly defied his understanding.
Chen Ping smiled, offering no explanation. “Thank you for your efforts, Seventh Hall Master.”
In the Demon-Suppressing Tower, one year outside equated to a century within. Though Chen Ping had only stayed three days, nearly a year had passed inside the tower.
Feeling the surging power within him, Chen Ping’s gaze softened as it fell on Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun.
Upon breaking through, he had noticed that, though the two girls said nothing, their brows betrayed unmistakable exhaustion, and their spiritual energy flowed sluggishly.
Clearly, they had sustained hidden injuries from their battle with the Shadow Guards but were holding on to avoid worrying him.
“You two, come here,” Chen Ping beckoned, his tone carrying an undeniable concern.
Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun exchanged a glance and obediently stepped forward.
Mo Qingyun instinctively tried to hide the bruise on her wrist, but Chen Ping grabbed it.
“Trying to hide this little injury from me?”
His fingertips brushed the purplish mark, where the chilling aura of the Shadow Guards’ poison blades lingered. “And Jingjing, the spiritual energy congestion in your dantian, did you think I wouldn’t notice?”
Huo Jingjing’s cheeks flushed, and she murmured, “It’s fine, a few days’ rest will do.”
“No.”
Chen Ping shook his head, a faint golden glow emanating from his palm, enveloping them in a warm aura. “The sinister energy in your bodies has invaded your meridians. Ordinary pills can’t eradicate it.
I’ll use my Golden Dragon Bloodline to guide it out, and…” He paused, chuckling at their instantly flushed faces. “And, by the way, use dual cultivation to help stabilise your realms.”
“D-dual cultivation?!” Mo Qingyun recoiled as if scalded, her ears red enough to drip blood. “Chen Ping, that’s… that’s too…”
Huo Jingjing lowered her gaze, her long lashes trembling, fingers twisting her clothing’s hem, yet she didn’t outright refuse.
After all, Chen Ping announcing dual cultivation in front of so many people was mortifying.
Hu Mazi, standing nearby, let out a snicker, crossing his arms teasingly. “Oi, Chen Ping, if you want to get cosy with the girls, just say so. Why hide behind healing? We’re all men here, who doesn’t get it?”
“You don’t know shit.”
Chen Ping laughed, scolding him. “The chilling energy in their bodies clashes with my Golden Dragon Bloodline. Only dual cultivation can fully expel it. Besides, they’ve risked life and death with me. Helping them advance their cultivation, isn’t that only fair?”
Hu Mazi grinned. “Fair! Absolutely fair! Hurry up then, I’ll guard outside, make sure no one disturbs you!”
