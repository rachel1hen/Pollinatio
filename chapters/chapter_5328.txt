“Well done.”
Chen Ping nodded. “Try this move ‘Stone Shattering Heaven’ again. Pay attention to the condensation and explosion of spiritual energy at the sword tip. It should be like the surging of earth veins; seemingly calm, but actually hiding thunder.”
He demonstrated personally. The branch pointed out; it seemed slow, yet at the moment of touching the stone, it erupted with an astonishing force. The bluestone shattered instantly, but was wrapped in a gentle power. No fragments flew; it only turned into a pile of fine stone powder.
Ling Xue watched in astonishment; she then fell into deep thought.
She swung the long sword over and over. At first, it was inevitably awkward, but as her control over spiritual energy became more proficient, the sword moves gradually gained some of the steadiness and resilience of a rock.
As the sun set in the west, dozens more sword marks appeared on the Sword Testing Cliff. Each one exuded a restrained and heavy force. Ling Xue sheathed her sword and stood; her forehead was covered in sweat beads, yet her face carried an excited flush. “Senior Brother, I think… I’ve grasped the basics.”
Chen Ping looked at the gleam flickering in her eyes; his heart stirred slightly.
He stepped forward and reached out to wipe the sweat from her cheek. The warmth of his fingertip made her tremble slightly.
“Your sword heart is inherently pure. Now with a solid foundation, your progress will surely be faster in the future.” He paused, then took out a jade box from his storage bag. “This is ‘Azure Veined Jade Marrow’. After you return, dissolve a bit in spiritual water and soak your hands daily. It can make your spiritual energy more compatible with the sword.”
The jade box opened; inside lay a piece of entirely green jade marrow. It was covered in fine azure patterns, with spiritual energy faintly circulating. It was evidently an extremely precious treasure.
Ling Xue looked at the jade marrow, then at Chen Ping; her eyes reddened slightly. “Senior Brother, you always…”
“Between us, no need for such words.”
Chen Ping smiled as he closed the jade box and placed it in her hand. “Go back now. Tomorrow at dawn, we’ll come here again to practice swordsmanship.”
Ling Xue gripped the jade box tightly; the warmth of the jade marrow came through her fingertips, and a warm current surged in her heart.
“Senior Brother, I don’t want to leave. I want you to love me…”
Ling Xue said!
What she could give back to Chen Ping now was only her own body.
“Are you still alright? Even walking hurts…” Chen Ping was somewhat worried.
“It’s fine…” Ling Xue finished speaking and took the initiative to remove her clothes!
Seeing this, Chen Ping did not hesitate any longer and took the initiative to pounce on Ling Xue.
He knew that Ling Xue was no longer that pure little girl, but a woman who had experienced the exhilarating sensation of flying through the heavens.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi consolidated their cultivation at the Sword Sect’s base for a few more days!
On this day, Chen Ping addressed Mo Chen gravely. “Master, Hu Master and I plan to head to the Black Wind Mountain Range today to deal with the Evil Path Hall’s branch hall matter.”
Mo Chen knew that Chen Ping and Hu Mazi were determined to go to the Evil Path Hall’s branch hall; blocking them would be meaningless. So he nodded. “Go early and return early. Be extra careful.”
“The Evil Path Hall acts mysteriously; do not be careless.” He paused, then added, “I’ve already had someone prepare elixirs and resources. Take them with you.”
“Thank you, Master.” Chen Ping cupped his hands in thanks, then turned to look at Hu Mazi. “Hu Master, let’s set off.”
Hu Mazi had long been impatient; upon hearing this, he immediately nodded. “Let’s go, let’s go! I want to see where those evil cultivators have hidden the divine souls of my Hu clan!”
The two were about to set off when Ling Xue ran out from the room; her forehead still bore fine sweat beads, evidently having just calmed her emotions.
She held a package in her hand and hurried to Chen Ping. “Senior Brother, this is some immortal herbs I prepared for you. Take them with you.”
“You stay home and cultivate well. No need to worry about us.”
Chen Ping took the package; his fingertip inadvertently touched the back of her hand, feeling that delicate warmth. His heart stirred slightly.
Ling Xue bit her lip; her eyes were full of reluctance. “I… I want to go with you too.”
But as soon as the words fell, she could not help but furrow her brows. The soreness between her legs made her clearly aware that she was not suited for long travel at the moment.
