On the plain, immortal grasses over a zhang tall could be seen everywhere. Their leaves shimmered with a lustrous spiritual light. Some immortal grasses bore vermilion immortal fruits at their tips, emanating enticing spiritual energy fluctuations.
The ground occasionally bulged with strips of azure veins. Those were immortal veins exposed on the surface. Faint golden spiritual energy could vaguely be seen surging within the vein tubes, like the earth’s blood vessels.
“Is this the Divine Fall Plain?”
Chen Ping was secretly astonished in his heart.
He had seen many spiritual veins in the Fifth Heaven, but he had never encountered such dense and pure clusters of immortal veins.
The resources on this plain alone probably equated to the total of half the forces in the Fifth Heaven.
It was no wonder the Divine Kingdom, possessing such a treasure land, could become a top force in the Sixth Heaven.
The Divine Kingdom princess, with her hands bound, sensed the familiar aura. Her expression grew even more unsightly. She turned her face away, refusing to look at the scene below. Evidently, for this land that nurtured the divine clan, she felt only resistance and disgust.
“Ahead is the Divine Capital of the Divine Kingdom.”
The princess’s voice carried a hint of coldness. “Outside the Divine Capital, there are three layers of barriers. Only those holding a Divine Kingdom token or possessing divine clan bloodline can enter. If you try to force your way in, you will only be torn apart by the barrier’s divine power.”
Chen Ping did not respond. He merely scanned ahead with sharp eyes.
Indeed, at the end of the plain, the outline of a massive city gradually became clear.
The walls of the Divine Capital were built from pale golden divine stones, reaching a hundred zhang high. The walls were engraved with intricate golden divine patterns. As the divine patterns flowed, an invisible barrier enveloped the entire city, emitting a palpitating pressure.
At the city gate stood dozens of divine guards clad in silver armour. Each divine guard’s aura was above the seventh grade of the Earth Immortal realm. The double-winged divine patterns on their long spears gleamed brightly. The vigilance was strict.
Chen Ping, with the princess, slowly landed at the city gate. As soon as they touched down, two divine guards immediately stepped forward. Their long spears pointed straight at Chen Ping. “Who goes there? How dare you trespass into the Divine Capital! Release Her Highness the Princess at once!”
The princess raised her head and said coldly. “I came with him willingly. Have your commander come out to see me.”
The divine guards exchanged glances, their faces full of shock and doubt.
The orders they received were to retrieve the princess at all costs. Now, the princess had been brought by a human clan cultivator and claimed it was voluntary. This left them unsure how to respond.
One of the divine guards dared not delay. He quickly turned and ran towards the city interior, evidently to report.
The remaining divine guards, though they did not retract their spears, did not act rashly either. They merely surrounded Chen Ping and the princess vigilantly, their eyes fixed on Chen Ping, fearing he might harm the princess.
After about the time it takes to burn an incense stick, a crisp sound of ring pendants came from within the city.
A woman slowly approached. She wore a light purple palace gown, with exquisite phoenix bird divine patterns embroidered on the skirt hem. Her jet-black long hair was styled in a flying仙 bun, adorned with a red gold hairpin inlaid with gems. Her skin was fair as jade. Her brows and eyes carried a touch of charm, yet also a hint of steadiness.
She appeared to be in her early twenties, but her aura had already reached the peak of the eighth grade of the Earth Immortal realm.
The woman walked up to Chen Ping. Her gaze first swept over the princess with bound hands, then landed on Chen Ping. Her tone was flat, yet carried a hint of scrutiny. “Fellow Daoist, thank you for escorting Her Highness the Princess back to the Divine Capital.
I am the advisor by the side of the Kingdom Lord, named Ziyan. May I know your esteemed surname and given name? For escorting the princess back this time, do you have any requests?”
Chen Ping looked at Ziyan, pondering inwardly.
The advisor to the Divine Kingdom’s lord was unexpectedly so young and beautiful, with profound cultivation.
For ordinary cultivators to climb to this position, it would require at least several hundred years of accumulation. Yet Ziyan appeared so young. She was either exceptionally talented or had special connections.
Looking at her palace gown, though not in the style of empress or consort, the materials were exquisite and distinctly different from ordinary officials’ attire.
