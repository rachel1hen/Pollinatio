Behind the stone gate of the Seventh Hall, Yun Wuya rubbed his eyes, muttering, “I… I didn’t see that wrong, did I? That was one of the Eight Great Consecrators…”
Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun clung tightly to each other, their eyes filled with both worry and uncontainable excitement.
The Seventh Hall Master stood with his mouth agape, unable to speak for a long while, his despair replaced by sheer shock.
“Together!” The remaining seven Consecrators exchanged a glance, a ruthless glint in their eyes, and attacked simultaneously.
A barrage of sinister treasures and techniques surged towards Chen Ping: chains entwined with ghostly shadows, bone needles radiating deadly poison, black flames capable of corroding spiritual energy… In an instant, the sky was woven with a tapestry of malevolent forces, forming a deadly net that enveloped Chen Ping.
The Twelve Blood Guards also launched their assault, transforming into twelve blood-red shadows. Powered by secret techniques fueled by their essence blood, they moved at blinding speed, their blood blades glinting with cold light, sealing off all of Chen Ping’s escape routes.
Faced with such a ferocious onslaught, Chen Ping remained utterly unfazed.
He took a deep breath, his internal spiritual energy surging wildly, the golden light on the Dragon-Slaying Sword growing ever more radiant.
“Sword Domain, activate!”
With a low shout, countless golden sword auras materialized around Chen Ping, forming a vast sword domain.
Within the domain, golden sword auras crisscrossed like a massive golden net.
“Clink, clank…”
The sinister treasures and techniques collided with the sword domain, instantly shattered by the golden sword auras, dissolving into countless specks of light.
The blood blades of the Twelve Blood Guards struck the sword domain, producing crisp sounds but failing to harm Chen Ping in the slightest.
“Impossible!” one Consecrator cried out, his face etched with disbelief.
Chen Ping’s lips curled into a cold smirk. The sword domain suddenly contracted, and countless golden sword auras shot out like a torrential rain, sweeping towards the Eight Consecrators and Twelve Blood Guards.
“Ah!”
Screams echoed one after another. The golden sword auras were like the scythe of death, leaving blood and flesh in their wake.
One Consecrator’s heart was pierced by a sword aura, his body exploding into a mist of blood.
A Blood Guard’s head was severed by a sword aura, rolling to the ground, eyes wide open, unable to rest in death…
Chen Ping was like a tiger among sheep, rampaging through the enemy ranks.
Each swing of the Dragon-Slaying Sword brought blood and death.
His movements were graceful and fluid, like a leisurely stroll, yet he always dodged enemy attacks at the last possible moment while delivering fatal strikes.
On the plaza, blood stained the green stone ground, severed limbs scattered everywhere, the thick stench of blood nauseating.
Though the Eight Consecrators and Twelve Blood Guards were fearless, in the face of Chen Ping, they were as fragile as clay dogs.
You Wuxie hovered in mid-air, the expression beneath his black robe growing increasingly grim.
He had believed that the Eight Consecrators and Twelve Blood Guards would be enough to tear Chen Ping to pieces, yet he never expected such formidable strength.
A cultivator at the sixth level of the Loose Immortal Realm possessing such terrifying combat power defied his understanding.
“How is this possible… sixth level of the Loose Immortal Realm… how could he have strength comparable to the Earth Immortal Realm…”
You Wuxie muttered to himself, his voice trembling slightly.
In the time it took for a single incense stick to burn, the Eight Consecrators and Twelve Blood Guards had all fallen.
The plaza was littered with corpses, rivers of blood flowing, with only Chen Ping standing proudly in the centre, the blood on the Dragon-Slaying Sword dripping slowly, splashing into blood blossoms on the ground.
He looked up at You Wuxie, his gaze as cold as eternal ice, “Now, it’s your turn.”
You Wuxie snapped back to reality, a ruthless glint flashing in his eyes, “Kid, you’ve succeeded in enraging me!”
“Nine Nether Soul Banners, emerge!”
With a furious shout, the nine soul banners expanded instantly, transforming into nine towering pillars. The faces on the banners roared and rushed out, turning into countless ghostly shadows that lunged towards Chen Ping.
