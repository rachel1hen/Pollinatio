“Divine soul possession?” You Wuxie’s pupils contracted sharply beneath his black robe, the nine soul banners trembling violently, “Could it be the descendant of some old monster?”
“According to the message, that divine soul claimed to hail from the Ninth Heaven.”
“The Ninth Heaven?”
You Wuxie shot to his feet, black mist surging around him, causing the blood pool in the palace to churn with towering waves, “No wonder! No wonder the Nether Twins died so miserably! So, it’s someone from the Ninth Heaven meddling!”
The Shadow Guards in the hall were terrified, prostrating themselves on the ground.
They had never seen the Grand Elder so unhinged. The words “Ninth Heaven” seemed to carry a terrifying, magical weight.
You Wuxie took a deep breath, forcibly suppressing his shock.
He sat back down, fingers tapping the table with a dull thud, “The Ninth Heaven, hmph, so what if it’s a divine soul from the Ninth Heaven? Anyone who dares kill our Evil Path Hall’s people will pay a price!”
“Not just a Ninth Heaven divine soul, even a Ninth Heaven cultivator wouldn’t scare our Evil Path Hall!”
This statement boldly declared the Evil Path Hall’s strength, unafraid even of Ninth Heaven cultivators!
An organisation capable of seeking tokens, secretly gathering souls, and planning to locate the Tianlin Cave Mansion couldn’t be weak.
Without sufficient strength, even if they found the coordinates to the Tianlin Cave Mansion, they’d lack the power to protect it.
“Grand Elder, that Chen Ping is currently healing in the Seventh Hall, and the Seventh Hall Master seems intent on protecting him…”
“The Seventh Hall?” You Wuxie sneered, the tormented faces on his soul banners letting out shrill wails, “A self-proclaimed divine clan, a declining branch of the Divine Hall, dares to meddle in my affairs? Issue the order: summon the eight consecrators of the Shadow Pavilion and the twelve Blood Guards. I’ll personally head to the Seventh Hall!”
You Wuxie didn’t even regard the Divine Hall, or the entire divine clan, with any respect.
“What?” The old man was stunned, “Grand Elder, you’re going to act personally?”
The eight consecrators were each half a step into the Earth Immortal Realm, top-tier powerhouses, while the twelve Blood Guards, tempered by refined blood, had combat strength comparable to the peak of the Loose Immortal Realm.
Such a lineup could easily sweep through the entire Third Heaven, yet the Grand Elder was mobilizing them to deal with one Chen Ping.
A ruthless glint flashed in You Wuxie’s eyes, “This boy, able to host a Ninth Heaven divine soul, is no ordinary fish in the pond.”
“If we don’t crush him before his wings fully form, he’ll become a major threat! Besides…”
He stroked the shattered soul pearls on the table, his voice icy, “Someone has to pay for the Nether Twins and Ghost Face.”
“But Grand Elder, the Divine Hall…”
“The Divine Hall?” You Wuxie scoffed, “The Divine Hall is fractured, its hall masters at odds. They wouldn’t dare interfere in our Evil Path Hall’s business.”
“Tell the Seventh Hall Master: hand over the boy, or join him in turning to ash!”
“Yes!” The old man dared not argue further and bowed before retreating.
You Wuxie slowly rose, his black robe billowing without wind, the nine soul banners orbiting him, exuding a suffocating pressure, “Chen Ping… a Ninth Heaven divine soul… Let’s see how much you’re worth.”
With that, his figure dissolved into a wisp of black smoke, vanishing from the hall.
The eight consecrators and twelve Blood Guards followed, a dense swarm of black shadows streaking toward the Seventh Hall like a plague of locusts.
Above Blackwind Abyss, the already gloomy sky grew darker, as if foreshadowing an impending bloodstorm.
In the stone chamber of the Seventh Hall, the atmosphere was so heavy it could almost drip water.
The Seventh Hall Master held the Evil Path Hall’s transmission jade slip, his hands trembling, his face pale as paper, “The Evil Path Hall… they’ve gone mad!”
“I never imagined the people Chen Ping killed were from the Evil Path Hall…”
