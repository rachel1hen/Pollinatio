Sun Moon City!
Lin Chong held the jade slip in his hand, his face etched with a grave expression!
“Emperor Lin, has something happened in Wuwang Land?”
Limitless Daoist asked!
“Daoist, Mr. Chen killed an elder of the Qian Sect and the young master of the Tang Sect in Wuwang Land, stealing the spotlight and basking in glory!”
Lin Chong said!
“Isn’t that a good thing? With this, no one will dare scheme against Chen Ping in the shadows anymore.”
Limitless Daoist gave a slight smile!
“But now the Triple Alliance has gathered all their top fighters and headed to Wuwang Land, and if the Huo family joins in, their combined strength isn’t something to underestimate!”
Lin Chong replied!
“Even with the Triple Alliance and the Huo family, there’s no need to fear, as long as Chen Ping doesn’t provoke the Fire Incineration Sect or the Four Nether Palaces.”
“Sun Moon City, the third greatest power in the Celestial Realm, isn’t a title for nothing…”
Limitless Daoist said calmly!
“That’s true, since the Triple Alliance and the Huo family want to play, Sun Moon City will join the game.”
With that, Lin Chong shouted outward, “Someone, come here…”
“Your Majesty…” A figure stepped in immediately!
“Gather all cultivators above ninth-grade Mahayana, we’re heading to Wuwang Land with me…”
Lin Chong ordered!
“Yes, sir!”
Soon, Sun Moon City’s elite assembled, and under Lin Chong and Limitless Daoist’s leadership, they set off straight for Wuwang Land!
Though the Heaven-Climbing Ladder hadn’t yet descended, Lin Chong couldn’t wait, he had to ensure Chen Ping’s safety!
In an instant, Wuwang Land turned into a storm of activity, the number of cultivators surging, and all of them top-tier!
The Huo family, lords of Wuwang Land, began to grow wary!
“Have you found out anything? Why’s Wuwang Land suddenly swarming with so many people this year?”
Huo family patriarch Huo Zhenfeng asked!
Even when the Heaven-Climbing Ladder descended in past years, it never drew this many cultivators, especially since it hadn’t even arrived yet, and whether it’d land in Wuwang Land was still up in the air!
Yet now, a flood of cultivators had rushed in, stirring a faint unease in Huo Zhenfeng!
“Patriarch, that Chen Ping killed the Qian Sect’s third elder and Tang Sect’s young master Tang Xiaoyi, completely pissing off the Triple Alliance, so they’ve rallied all their best to Wuwang Land to take revenge on him.”
Steward Lu said quietly!
“What? This Chen Ping’s got some guts, doesn’t he know fear?”
Huo Zhenfeng frowned, unable to fathom what Chen Ping was up to.
“Young and reckless, that’s all, he made a huge splash at the Dao Sect, but he’s also racked up plenty of enemies in the process.”
“The Triple Alliance won’t let him off, they’ve even sent people here, wanting to team up with our Huo family to take down that cocky Chen Ping.”
Steward Lu explained!
“Team up?” Huo Zhenfeng mulled it over, then asked, “Have you figured out the power behind this Chen Ping? No way a lone cultivator like him would dare act this bold without backing.”
“It’s clear now, it’s Lin Chong’s Sun Moon City, this time he came with their princess, I’d guess Chen Ping and the princess are lovers.”
Steward Lu said!
“No wonder, without Sun Moon City behind him, this kid wouldn’t dare strut around like that,” Huo Zhenfeng nodded, then asked, “Have the other forces shown up too?”
“The Fire Incineration Sect’s here, the Four Nether Palaces haven’t arrived yet, but there are a lot of unfamiliar faces this time, all pretty strong, no clue which sects they’re from.”
Steward Lu reported truthfully!
“Looks like this year’s Heaven-Climbing Ladder’s gonna be a mess, tell everyone, the Huo family’s staying out of any fights, we won’t grab resources in the ladder either, just focus on keeping things running smoothly for everyone in Wuwang Land.”
“Especially that Chen Ping, no one’s to go after him for revenge, let the Triple Alliance handle it, when Sun Moon City and the Triple Alliance duke it out, we’ll just sit back and watch the show!”
Huo Zhenfeng quickly weighed the pros and cons, then issued his orders!
“Understood!” Steward Lu nodded and left!
