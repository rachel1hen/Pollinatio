However, in an instant, the huge silhouette was sucked into the belly of that little Heaven Swallowing Beast!
Mu Qing’s figure was revealed!
Mu Qing was shocked, but Chen Ping’s Holy Light Fist was already in front of him, so it was too late to dodge!
Boom!
Mu Qing was hit solidly by Chen Ping’s move!
Mu Qing’s body instantly flew backwards, spitting blood from his mouth!
He had never expected that this would happen!
Seeing this, Chief Liu instantly panicked as his body leapt up and towards Chen Ping then slapped his palm out!
The palm imprint condensed and covered the sky!
Seeing this, the Palace Master of Guanghan Palace’s body also rose up in the air in an instant, the temperature of the heaven and earth suddenly lowered, accompanied by a palm slap that directly froze and shattered the palm imprints of that General Manager Liu!
Only then did he not allow Chen Ping to be harmed, otherwise if this Chief Steward Liu made a move, Chen Ping would definitely not be killed or injured!
“Kill …………”
Along with Chief Steward Liu following the Broad Cold Palace Palace Master to exchange blows, Luo Shouhai let out an explosive shout!
In an instant, everyone rushed up to the sky!
Originally, they had already made preparations, and now they were striking out a stream of spiritual energy!
The Mu Family’s crowd also struck out at the same time!
Just as the melee was on the verge of breaking out, the void shook, followed by a figure surfacing in midair!
“Father …………”
Seeing the person who came, Mu Qing was instantly excited!
It turned out to be a silhouette of the Mu Family’s head that had come, it should have known that Mu Qing and the others had come to retaliate against the Broad Cold Palace, so they had come worried!
“Qing’er, you’re too careless, nowadays my father only has yourself as a son, what if something happens to you?”
“Now go do what you need to do, I’ll hold off the others!”
The Mu Family Head said to Mu Qing!
With his father’s words, Mu Qing nodded with a face full of excitement!
However, the Broad Cold Palace Palace Master’s face was terribly gloomy at this moment, her eyes filled with ice!
A Chief Liu, she was still able to deal with!
But there was another Mu Family Head, and even though it was only a shadow, his strength was afraid to be no less than the ninth rank of the Transition Realm!
“I’ll block this old guy!”
Only to see the Demon Mountain Ghost Elder let out a furious cry, followed by grey aura surging within his body, directly forming a giant claw and heading towards that Mu Family Head!
The Broad Cold Palace Palace Master also waved his hand, and monstrous cold Qi surged out, transforming into two icicles that attacked towards that Chief Liu!
The melee instantly began, countless breaths flew across the sky, and all sorts of techniques intermingled!
The heavens and earth trembled in the midst of this melee, and the entire Southern Domain seemed to be affected as a temporal rift continuously flashed in the void!
The entire Heavenly Demon Mountain shook as countless people gazed in the direction of the Guanghan Palace!
Thousands of cultivators, mingled in mid-air!
The air was filled with heavy aura fluctuations, and every time a cultivator swung a fist or a sword, it was accompanied by a huge roar of spiritual energy, as if it was going to tear this heaven and earth apart.
Their silhouettes rapidly travelled across the battlefield, as elusive as ghosts, and every exchange was accompanied by dazzling bursts of spiritual light that illuminated the entire battlefield.
The cultivators’ magic treasures and spirit weapons danced in the air, some cutting through the sky like meteors, some pressing down as heavily as giant mountains, and others drifting like phantoms.
Each collision of magic treasures emitted a deafeningly loud sound that shook the ground.
The rays of the magic treasures intertwined together, forming a splendid sea of light that enveloped the entire battlefield.
The shouts, roars, and incantations of the cultivators rose and fell, merging into a stirring battle symphony.
Determination and madness were written all over their faces, and every pair of eyes shone with a fiery light, as if they were about to pour out all their strength.
On the battlefield, dust flew and smoke filled the air. Every time a cultivator fell to the ground, it was accompanied by a bloom of blood that dyed the land bright red.
