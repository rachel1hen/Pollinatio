Mid-conversation, a sudden tremor shook the ground nearby!
From one of the cages, a blinding white light burst forth!
*Boom!*
With a thunderous roar, a figure smashed through the cage!
“Bloody hell, who’s the sod setting up cages at the end of the Great Path’s guidance? What a rotten trick!”
Hu Mazi stormed over, cursing up a storm!
Xiu Rui gaped at him, trembling slightly, and asked, “Friend Chen, is this the mate you were looking for?”
“Yeah!” Chen Ping nodded, then turned to Hu Mazi, “Master Hu, where are we?”
“No clue, but this has to be the Heavenly Realm. Just don’t know which git set up these cages!”
Hu Mazi glanced around as he spoke!
“Master Hu, since your memories are back, can you fill me in on the Heavenly Realm’s rules, order, and cultivation ranks?”
Chen Ping pressed Hu Mazi for answers!
“Rules? Order? The Heavenly Realm’s got none of that nonsense. Might makes right. If your realm’s high and your strength’s top-notch, you *are* the rules, you *are* the order.”
“You think the Laws of Heaven were cooked up by who? Those high-and-mighty Saints, that’s who. They’re the big dogs, so they call it rules, and it becomes rules!”
“One day, if you become the Master of the Universe, the Heavenly Realm’s nothing, and those Saints are just birds to be swatted with a slap!”
Hu Mazi grumbled, clearly fed up!
“Quit puffing me up and just tell me about the Heavenly Realm!” Chen Ping was exasperated!
If not for the Red Cloud Demon Lord stepping in earlier, he’d still be stuck in that cage. Master of the Universe? That was a pipe dream. He just wanted to get a grip on the here and now!
“You probably know the Heavenly Realm has thirty-six heavens, right?” Hu Mazi began.
“Yeah!” Chen Ping nodded.
“The thirty-six heavens are split into three tiers: the lower twelve, middle twelve, and upper twelve. Each set of twelve has smaller planes, with every three heavens forming one.”
“Monks guided by the Great Path or other means arrive within the first three heavens. The immortals there are all Loose Immortals, wild cultivators without an official seal.”
“So monks in the first three heavens are looked down on. That’s why some would rather grind away to ascend naturally than take the Great Path’s guidance!”
“Those who cultivate and ascend on their own go straight to the fourth heaven. They’re Earth Immortals, the weakest in the Heavenly Realm.”
“Next up are Human Immortals, Heavenly Immortals, Upper Immortals, True Immortals, Golden Immortals, Great Luo Golden Immortals, Immortal Lords, Immortal Kings, Immortal Emperors, and Saints…”
“Each rank has nine tiers. But in the Heavenly Realm, advancing doesn’t bring thunder tribulations. You need to pass the Immortal Ascension Platform. Every major rank-up requires clearing it!”
“You’re just at the Immortal Transformation Realm now, not even a Loose Immortal. Keep at it, mate…”
Hu Mazi clapped Chen Ping’s shoulder as he spoke!
“Master Hu, before your reincarnation, which heaven were you in? What rank?” Chen Ping asked.
“Ugh, I was at the peak of Human Immortal, just shy of becoming a Heavenly Immortal and leaving the sixth heaven…”
“Got done in by a woman, though. What a waste of thousands of years of cultivation…”
Hu Mazi’s face twisted with bitter resentment!
Xiu Rui, listening nearby, didn’t dare make a peep!
Human Immortal?
That was bloody impressive! He’d fought tooth and nail and still couldn’t ascend, so he’d taken the Ladder to Heaven to get here. Even if he grasped ascension now, he’d only be a Loose Immortal.
Earth Immortals were trash in the Heavenly Realm, so Loose Immortals like him? No one gave them a second glance!
Chen Ping, absorbed in Hu Mazi’s words, forgot to ask what ranks Nan Batian and the others were, or which heaven they were in!
