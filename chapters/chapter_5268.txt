In the afternoon of Sword Saint City, sunlight filtered through the layered sword-shaped window lattices, casting dappled shadows on the bluestone path.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi sat in a room, a map of the Black Wind Mountain Range spread out on the table, surrounded by several yellowed talisman papers freshly drawn by Hu Mazi, faint traces of spiritual energy still lingering in their runes.
“Chen Ping, the Black Wind Mountain Range is thick with malign energy. These ‘Clear Malign Talismans’ of mine can only protect us for about three miles,” Hu Mazi said, tapping the talisman papers, his rough fingertips brushing their edges.
As the two discussed their plan to investigate the Evil Path Hall’s branch, a sharp sound of metal shattering rang out from outside, followed by the startled cries of market cultivators.
Hu Mazi leapt to his feet, stuffing the talismans into his robe: “Damn it, is there more excitement to see?”
Chen Ping had already darted outside, spotting five silver-armoured figures approaching on flying swords. The leader wore a golden robe embroidered with ferocious beast patterns, a sword-shaped brand on his forehead glinting sharply in the sunlight, unmistakably the Sixth Hall Master of the Divine Hall.
Behind him, four guards wielded long halberds, their tips flowing with golden spiritual energy, clearly the elite “Golden Armoured Guards” of the Divine Hall.
“Chen Ping! I’ve finally found you!” the Sixth Hall Master’s voice boomed like thunder, his spiritual energy sending shockwaves that struck the inn’s archway.
With a “crack,” the bluestone archway shattered into pieces.
Nearby cultivators scattered in fear, none daring to intervene.
“Who are you?” Chen Ping asked coldly, staring at the Sixth Hall Master.
“Divine Hall, Sixth Hall Master…”
At those words, the surrounding cultivators retreated even further.
Everyone knew the Divine Hall was a major force among the Divine Clan, and these Divine Clan members were arrogant, quick to fight at the slightest provocation.
“Divine Hall’s filthy dog!” Hu Mazi roared, raising a talisman paper. Three yellow talismans instantly transformed into three fire crows, flapping their wings as they charged at the Sixth Hall Master. “Chen Ping, let me take him on!”
“Master Hu, don’t be reckless, your strength…” Chen Ping’s words were cut off as Hu Mazi already made his move.
The Sixth Hall Master sneered, his right hand forming a claw. Five golden claw shadows slashed through the air, tearing the fire crows into a shower of sparks as they approached.
“A talisman-playing rogue cultivator dares to act brazenly before this Hall Master?”
With a flicker, the Sixth Hall Master appeared above the stone pavilion like a spectre, his God-Locking Claw whistling through the air, aiming straight for Chen Ping’s crown.
The claw shadows carried traces of blood-red energy, their power terrifyingly immense.
Chen Ping didn’t dare hesitate. He pushed his Fire Control Step to its limit, his body drifting back like a willow in the wind, while his right hand summoned the Dragon-Slaying Sword.
“Chh!”
The clash of sword light and claw shadows produced a piercing screech.
Chen Ping felt a chilling force spread from his fingertips, numbing his arm instantly. He was sent flying back, crashing into a stone pavilion pillar to steady himself, a metallic taste rising in his throat as he forcibly swallowed the blood that surged to his mouth.
“Seventh Grade of the Loose Immortal Realm? You’ve improved a bit, but you’re still an ant,” the Sixth Hall Master sneered, waving his left hand.
The four Golden Armoured Guards immediately formed a battle array, their halberds weaving a massive golden net that trapped Chen Ping and Hu Mazi in its centre.
These guards were all at the Fifth Grade of the Earth Immortal Realm, and with the battle array’s enhancement, their aura faintly reached the Sixth Grade. The sacred power in their halberd shadows naturally countered Hu Mazi’s talismans.
The strength of the Divine Hall’s branch halls grew with their rank, and these four Fifth-Grade Earth Immortal guards showed that the Sixth Hall was a significant force in the Sixth Heaven.
“Let’s go…” Chen Ping knew that he and Hu Mazi were no match for the Sixth Hall Master and tried to pull Hu Mazi away to escape.
But the Sixth Hall Master’s claw shadows followed like a shadow, their blood-red glow closing in on their backs.
