He looked at the corpse of the Three-Eyed Corrosive Scale Beast, discovered a pale green crystal in its skull, emitting faint spiritual power.
“This is the ‘Corrosive Scale Crystal’, perhaps it can be used to refine evil-breaking elixirs.”
He put away the crystal, turned his head to look at Hu Mazi. “It seems the dangers in the Sixth Heaven are more than we anticipated.”
Hu Mazi nodded, put away the talismans. “Let’s go, first find a place with many cultivators to inquire about the location of Thunder Sound Temple, and by the way figure out what that Divine Kingdom is all about. This old man always feels that place is not simple.”
The two did not linger, rose into the air, flew towards the outside of the ancient forest. Along the way they encountered a few more demon beasts of considerable strength, but they were all easily dealt with.
About half an hour later, an open area appeared ahead, a small town situated in the valley, a wooden sign hung at the town entrance, with the three big characters “Clear Wind Town” written on it.
The town was bustling with people coming and going, mostly cultivators, some wearing Taoist robes, some wearing armour, others carrying huge weapons, the lowest auras were also Seventh Grade of Earth Immortal Realm.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi walked into the town, immediately attracting many gazes, although their auras were somewhat restrained, the pressure of Ninth Grade Earth Immortal Realm still made low-level cultivators feel palpitations.
“Two fellow Daoists, are you new to the Sixth Heaven?”
A middle-aged cultivator in grey cloth clothes stepped forward, with a kind smile on his face. “I am the guide of Clear Wind Town, surname Wang, if you want to inquire about news, or need accommodation, you can find me.”
Chen Ping looked at Guide Wang, discovered his cultivation was only Seventh Grade of Earth Immortal Realm, yet he dared to approach and speak, quite bold.
“We want to inquire about the location of Thunder Sound Temple,” Chen Ping said. “In addition, we also want to understand the situation of the ‘Divine Kingdom’.”
Guide Wang heard the words “Divine Kingdom”, his expression changed slightly, subconsciously looked around, lowered his voice. “Fellow Daoist, matters of the Divine Kingdom cannot be discussed casually on the street.
That is the top force in the Sixth Heaven, inhabited by divine clans, each one arrogant, if we human cultivators offend them, lightly our cultivation is crippled, heavily we lose our lives.”
Hu Mazi frowned. “So powerful? What is the relationship between the Divine Kingdom and the Divine Palace? I heard the Sixth Hall of the Divine Palace is also in the Sixth Heaven.”
Guide Wang sighed, led the two to a corner of a teahouse to sit down, ordered a pot of spiritual tea, then slowly said. “The Divine Kingdom and the Divine Palace, although both belong to the divine clans, are two different things.
The Divine Kingdom is the orthodox of the divine clans, occupying the ‘Divine Fall Plain’ in the east of the Sixth Heaven, the divine clans inside are born with divine power, their strength is extremely formidable.
While the Sixth Hall of the Divine Palace rose later, the Sixth Hall is in the ‘Dark Canyon’ in the west of the Sixth Heaven, the divine arts they cultivate are somewhat evil, it is said they even capture human cultivators to refine medicine, the Divine Kingdom looks down on them, they do not submit to the Divine Kingdom, these years open and secret struggles continue.”
“As for Thunder Sound Temple,” Guide Wang took a sip of tea, continued. “That is one of the few neutral forces in the Sixth Heaven, built on ‘Thunder Sound Mountain’, the temple master Infinite Daoist is a great power of Ninth Grade Earth Immortal Realm, kind and benevolent, often helps human cultivators, just disappeared for many years, recently appeared. From Clear Wind Town, head south for three thousand li, you can see Thunder Sound Mountain.”
Chen Ping nodded, took out a piece of immortal stone from the storage bag and handed it to Guide Wang. “Thank you, Brother Wang, for the information.”
Guide Wang accepted the immortal stone, the smile on his face grew warmer. “Fellow Daoist is polite. By the way, recently the Divine Kingdom seems to have some trouble, I heard a noble from the divine clan escaped, the Divine Kingdom sent many people to pursue.
If you encounter cultivators wearing silver armour, with double-wing divine patterns on the road, you must stay far away, those are the ‘Divine Guards’ of the Divine Kingdom, the lowest strength is also Eighth Grade of Earth Immortal Realm.”
