The Seventh Hall Master gritted his teeth and roared with feigned bravado, his hands swiftly forming seals. “Temple Guardians, seize him!”
Before his voice faded, eight powerful auras erupted from the four corners of the hall. Eight Temple Guardians, each at the eighth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, wielded divine weapons and surrounded Chen Ping in a Bagua formation.
Their eyes were cold, clearly under orders to kill intruders without mercy.
“Eight grasshoppers think they can stop me?”
Chen Ping chuckled lightly, too lazy to even draw his sword.
His figure moved like a phantom through the formation. Each time he raised his hand, a guardian screamed, sent flying with shattered weapons and broken spiritual veins, crashing heavily to the ground, their fate uncertain.
In just a few breaths, all eight Loose Immortal Realm guardians were defeated, sprawled across the floor.
The Seventh Hall Master’s pupils contracted, his face drained of colour.
He never imagined Chen Ping’s strength could be so terrifying!
Eighth-rank Loose Immortal guardians were like clay dogs in his hands!
“Who… who exactly are you?”
The Seventh Hall Master’s voice trembled as he instinctively stepped back, his hand stealthily reaching for the storage ring at his waist. “Do you know the consequences of defying the Temple?”
“Consequences?”
Chen Ping advanced step by step, his eyes glinting with cold light. “From the moment I offended the Tenth Hall, I already knew the consequences.”
“Let alone a mere Seventh Hall, even the entire Temple, or the whole Divine Clan, if they push me too far, I’ll wipe them out!”
“Such arrogance!”
The Seventh Hall Master suddenly pulled out a small golden flag, embroidered with countless stars, radiating the aura of the heavens.
“Chen Ping, don’t think you’re invincible! Watch my ‘Star Banner’ take you down!”
He fiercely waved the flag, and countless golden shadows roared out, surging towards Chen Ping like a tide.
Where they passed, the air seemed to solidify, and the world changed colour.
This was one of his trump treasures, once used to slay an opponent of the same realm!
Yet Chen Ping merely glanced at it, casually flicking his finger.
“Clang!”
A clear sword hum echoed through the hall. A refined golden sword qi shot from his fingertip, seemingly delicate but carrying the might to split heaven and earth.
The golden shadows melted like snow in sunlight before the sword qi, and even the ‘Star Banner’ let out a groan, its surface shattering inch by inch into dust!
The Seventh Hall Master: “…”
His hand, gripping the flagpole, trembled violently, his eyes filled with disbelief and fear.
This was a treasure he’d spent a thousand years refining, destroyed by a single flick of Chen Ping’s finger?!
“No… impossible!”
The Seventh Hall Master roared, opening his mouth to inhale, and a spinning golden relic flew from his brow.
The relic glowed brilliantly, forming a massive golden light shield before him, engraved with ancient Sanskrit, exuding a sacred and vast aura.
“This is the ‘Indestructible Diamond Relic’ I seized from the Western Buddhist Kingdom. Even a peak ninth-rank Loose Immortal can’t break it! Chen Ping, what can you do against my defence?!”
The Seventh Hall Master roared hysterically, as if clutching his last lifeline.
Chen Ping looked at the radiant golden shield, a playful smirk curving his lips.
He used no treasure, merely extending his right hand, palm upward, slowly pressing towards the shield.
“Boom!”
The moment his palm touched the shield, there was no earth-shaking roar, only a dull “crack.”
The ‘Indestructible Diamond Relic,’ claimed to be unbreakable even by a peak ninth-rank Loose Immortal, spread with countless spiderweb cracks from the point of contact. In just one breath, it shattered with a “bang”!
The golden relic let out a wail, its light dimming as it flew back to the Seventh Hall Master’s brow, nearly disintegrating.
