Hu Mazi nodded, and the group followed Chen Ping as they departed.
If that mysterious organisation sent more people, Chen Ping wasn’t sure he could handle them, so leaving first was the best option.
“Mr. Chen, where to next?” Yun Wuya asked.
“To Tianyan Sect. It’s about ten thousand miles from here, isn’t it?” Chen Ping said.
“Correct. The Barbarian Ancient Clan is only ten thousand miles from Tianyan Sect, a few days’ journey at most,” Yun Wuya nodded.
Chen Ping led the group towards Tianyan Sect, but after just one day of travel, his expression shifted slightly.
“Something’s off with the aura ahead…” Chen Ping cautiously eyed the path forward.
In the distance, streaks of blood-red lightning relentlessly struck a specific spot.
Yun Wuya glanced at it and hurriedly said, “Mr. Chen, that’s a blood-red thunder tribulation. Someone’s trying to break through from the Third Heaven to the Fourth Heaven.”
“This also means they’re transitioning from a Loose Immortal to an Earth Immortal, becoming a true immortal!”
“That thunder tribulation looks rather terrifying!” Chen Ping closely observed the blood-red lightning. With his current strength, he should be capable of reaching the Fourth Heaven as well.
Unfamiliar with this thunder tribulation, he said, “Come on, let’s take a look…”
“Mr. Chen, this thunder tribulation is extremely dangerous. Not everyone heading to the Fourth Heaven succeeds. If they fail, the tribulation’s wrath could put us at risk!” Yun Wuya warned.
“No matter. I can tame a thunder tribulation even stronger than this…” Chen Ping replied, heading straight for the blood-red lightning.
Seeing this, Hu Mazi and the others followed, and Yun Wuya, gritting his teeth, joined them.
At a hundred miles from the tribulation, they could already feel its terrifying power, making their progress difficult.
“Boom…”
A bolt of blood-red lightning crashed down from the sky!
But at the same moment, a surge of astral energy shot upwards, directly blocking the blood-red lightning.
Chen Ping was startled. He hadn’t expected someone in the Third Heaven to be this powerful.
Looking closely, he saw, beneath the tribulation, a middle-aged man in a light blue robe, holding a brush, exuding an air of refined elegance. He stared at the lightning in the sky, his eyes brimming with fighting spirit.
Behind him, countless top-tier cultivators sat cross-legged, streams of aura emanating from their bodies, continuously flowing into the middle-aged man.
Chen Ping noticed that the man was at the peak of the Loose Immortal realm, his aura remarkably strong, even surpassing that of the Seventh Hall Master.
More notably, among the top-tier cultivators behind him, many were at the seventh or eighth rank of the Loose Immortal realm, with five at the ninth rank!
Their eyes were filled with a resolve to face death, recklessly channelling their aura into the middle-aged man.
“What are they doing?” Hu Mazi asked, utterly perplexed.
“They’re using the strength of the entire clan to escort this man to ascend to the Fourth Heaven,” Yun Wuya explained.
“The entire clan’s strength? Can’t this man withstand the blood-red thunder tribulation on his own?” Chen Ping asked curiously.
By all accounts, the man was at the peak of the Loose Immortal realm. Advancing further would make him an Earth Immortal.
But to become an Earth Immortal, one must reach the Fourth Heaven, as the Third and Fourth Heavens exist in different planar worlds.
The Thirty-Six Heavens are divided into groups of three, each forming a distinct planar world.
“This blood-red thunder tribulation doesn’t just depend on realm. It also tests the strength of the body and overall power.”
“Very few cultivators can ascend to the Fourth Heaven.”
“So some clans pool their entire strength to ensure one of their own becomes an Earth Immortal.”
“But this is risky. If it fails, the whole clan suffers,” Yun Wuya said.
Hearing this, Chen Ping couldn’t help but sigh. This was a gamble with the fate of the entire clan!
