The moment the runes merged into the city’s grand formation, the entire city trembled violently, the black-robed cultivators turned pale, vomiting blood and flying backwards.
“My name is Chen Ping. I’m here to see your city lord, giving him face. If anyone dares to stop me, don’t blame me for striking hard!”
Chen Ping’s voice boomed like a great bell across the city, the lingering echo splitting cracks in the clouds.
The black-robed cultivators, faces grim, reluctantly cleared the way.
As Chen Ping and his group passed through the final city, the flying eaves of the city lord’s mansion came into view.
The vermilion gates slowly opened, revealing a middle-aged man in a golden python robe, standing with hands behind his back, the lord of Flying Tiger City, Xie Zhong.
His gaze, sharp as lightning, swept over the trio, “Who are you three? Why have I never seen you in Rhino City?”
The three stepped into the courtyard, and from Chen Ping’s sleeve flew an ancient jade slip, “Lord Xie, who we are doesn’t matter. What matters is we represent Lord Niu to negotiate with you.”
Xie Zhong caught the jade slip, his pupils contracting sharply. The courtyard’s atmosphere froze, only the evening breeze swirled fallen leaves between them.
Xie Zhong recognised the jade slip, it was Niu Mang’s symbol of authority, granting its bearer the power to make any promise on his behalf.
“Very well, let’s talk…”
Xie Zhong returned the jade slip to Chen Ping.
“Talk with you? Can you make decisions?” Chen Ping asked.
“Nonsense! I’m the lord of Flying Tiger City. If I can’t decide, who can?”
Xie Zhong snorted coldly.
“Though you’re the lord of Flying Tiger City, the one who truly calls the shots isn’t here, is it?”
Chen Ping’s gaze shifted westward.
In the western part of the city lord’s mansion lay a mountain range, along which stretched a dozen cities, all under Flying Tiger City’s influence.
Yet Chen Ping had noticed that these dozens of cities formed a grand formation. At first glance, they seemed to protect the central main city.
But Chen Ping sensed the formation’s core lay in the mountains, atop which sat a small, unremarkable city, one most would overlook.
Yet the core of this vast formation rested in that tiny city, which was clearly illogical.
Thus, Chen Ping deduced that Xie Zhong was merely the figurehead lord, the true master of Flying Tiger City must reside in that small city.
“What nonsense are you spouting? I’ve no idea what you mean. If you don’t want to talk, leave.”
“Anyway, Niu Mang’s son is in my hands. I’ve plenty of time to wait for him to negotiate.”
Xie Zhong, seemingly furious, spoke coldly.
Seeing Xie Zhong’s reaction, Chen Ping grew more certain his guess was correct.
“Of course we want to talk. Did we come all this way to sightsee?”
Chen Ping said.
“Fine, if you want to talk, come inside!”
Xie Zhong turned and entered the room.
“Big brother, be careful, it might be a trap…”
Mad Immortal warned Chen Ping.
“Son-in-law, we should be cautious. Xie Zhong is clearly toying with us, even sending men to test us at the checkpoint.”
Bai Yi also cautioned Chen Ping.
“You two wait outside. I’ll go in alone. If there’s danger, leave immediately, don’t worry about me.”
Chen Ping instructed Mad Immortal and Bai Yi.
“Big brother, what do you take me for? I’d risk my life to keep you safe.”
Mad Immortal said loyally.
Bai Yi glared at Chen Ping, “Son-in-law, if I fled alone, how could I face my daughter? Go negotiate. At worst, we’ll fight together.”
Chen Ping nodded and followed Xie Zhong into the room.
If it was just Xie Zhong, Chen Ping had no fear. With Xie Zhong’s strength, Chen Ping could handle him.
