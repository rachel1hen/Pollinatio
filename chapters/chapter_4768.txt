“Hmph, I know what you’re thinking, but your plan is flawed. We are not from the Heavenly Realm, so even in the Heavenly Human Realm, we won’t be affected in the slightest.”
After saying this, the Ten Hall Master turned his gaze to Hua Yueying.
Since this wasn’t an illusion array, yet Hua Yueying stood with her eyes closed, chanting incantations, she must be setting up another formation.
The Ten Hall Master’s expression turned cold, and his body instantly transformed into a streak of light, charging toward Hua Yueying.
He wanted to eliminate her first.
Having a formation master like her around would put him at a significant disadvantage.
Chen Ping immediately understood the Ten Hall Master’s intentions. With a flash, he appeared in front of Hua Yueying, swinging the Dragon-Slaying Sword in a powerful arc.
At the same time, Chen Ping’s clones also swung their swords toward the Ten Hall Master.
This time, the Ten Hall Master didn’t take the attack head-on. Instead, he retreated rapidly and then threw a punch at one of Chen Ping’s clones.
*Boom!*
Chen Ping’s clone was sent flying, dissipating into golden light in mid-air.
It was just one of Chen Ping’s clones.
However, losing a clone caused Chen Ping’s body to feel extreme discomfort.
Although the clones shared Chen Ping’s power, he also bore the damage they sustained.
The Nine Shadows Sword Technique had its pros and cons.
Seeing this, the Ten Hall Master sneered, as if he had discovered a weakness in Chen Ping’s technique.
He only needed to destroy the clones one by one, and Chen Ping would either die or be severely injured.
The Ten Hall Master’s eyes flashed with ruthlessness as he darted toward another one of Chen Ping’s clones.
His fist carried the force of thunder, aiming directly at the clone’s chest.
*Boom!*
Another deafening explosion echoed as Chen Ping’s clone was shattered into golden light, dissipating into the air.
Chen Ping’s main body paled instantly, and a trickle of blood escaped from the corner of his mouth.
The destruction of the clone not only drained his energy but also inflicted a heavy backlash on his body.
“Mr. Chen!”
Hua Yueying’s voice suddenly rang out, filled with urgency and determination.
Her hands moved rapidly, forming intricate seals in the air as she chanted incantations, as if summoning some mysterious power.
“Heaven and Earth, boundless and infinite, lend me your power. Let the rain of life descend and revive all things!”
With Hua Yueying’s shout, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and soon, countless crystal-clear droplets began to fall like a gentle rain.
These droplets were no ordinary water—they were infused with powerful life energy.
Chen Ping, Xuan Bin, and the others were enveloped in this rain, feeling a cool, soothing sensation spread through their bodies. It was as if countless tiny life forces were flowing through them, healing their wounds.
Chen Ping’s pale complexion quickly regained its color, and his injuries healed at a visible rate.
“This is… the Rain of Life?”
The Ten Hall Master frowned, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes.
He hadn’t expected Hua Yueying to be capable of summoning such a powerful healing formation. It left him momentarily stunned.
Even Chen Ping looked at Hua Yueying in astonishment. He had never seen or even heard of such a healing formation before.
At this moment, Chen Ping’s curiosity about Hua Yueying’s true identity grew significantly.
“Hmph, even if you’ve recovered, I can still take you down one by one!”
The Ten Hall Master sneered, his body darting forward again, this time targeting another one of Chen Ping’s clones.
However, this time, Chen Ping didn’t remain passive.
A glint of determination flashed in his eyes as he swung the Dragon-Slaying Sword with all his might, sending a brilliant arc of sword light toward the Ten Hall Master.
“Merge!”
With Chen Ping’s low shout, the remaining clones instantly merged into one, forming a massive sword shadow that slashed toward the Ten Hall Master.
The power of this sword strike far exceeded anything he had unleashed before, as if it could tear apart the heavens and the earth.
The Ten Hall Master’s expression changed, and he quickly threw a punch to block the attack. However, the force of the sword strike was beyond his expectations.
His fist collided with the sword shadow, only to be instantly shattered. The sword shadow continued unabated, heading straight for his chest.
*Boom!*
The Ten Hall Master was sent flying dozens of feet, a deep gash appearing on his chest as blood poured out.
His face twisted in pain and anger. He hadn’t expected Chen Ping, after recovering, to unleash such overwhelming power.
