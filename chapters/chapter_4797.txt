“Master Chen, my little sister can be reckless at times, I hope you won’t hold it against her!” Hong Yao hurriedly pleaded upon seeing the situation!
“You’re lucky because of your sister, otherwise you’d already be a corpse by now!” Chen Ping looked at Lan Yao, his eyes full of warning!
After speaking, Chen Ping turned to leave again. He didn’t want to get too entangled with this pair of twin sisters!
But who would’ve thought, just as Chen Ping started walking away, the two chased after him again!
“Anything else?” Chen Ping asked!
“Master Chen, my sister and I would like to follow you…” Hong Yao said straightforwardly!
“I don’t keep people by my side who’ve harboured ill intentions towards me!” Chen Ping shook his head!
“Master Chen, it was indeed my little sister’s fault just now, but please think carefully. This Wuwang Land belongs to the Huo family. They’ve put a bounty on you but haven’t sent anyone to hunt you down themselves. That means they want to make you a target for everyone.”
“The cultivators who come to Wuwang Land are all from hidden sects and powerful families. If they all turn against you, Master Chen, I’m afraid you’ll never have a day of peace!” Hong Yao explained to Chen Ping!
“Do you have a way to stop me from being targeted?” Chen Ping asked!
Hong Yao nodded, “Master Chen, the reason you’re being targeted is because your current realm is too low. I hope you’ll stop hiding your strength and reveal your true power directly. That way, some people will think twice and back off!”
“If you had shown your real strength earlier, Tang Xiaoyi probably wouldn’t have dared to provoke you so easily.”
Chen Ping smiled, “Third-grade Mahayana is my true realm. I haven’t hidden anything!”
“What?” Hong Yao was stunned!
A third-grade Mahayana cultivator instantly killing a peak ninth-grade Mahayana with one sword?
Wasn’t that a bit too outrageous?
After a moment of shock, Hong Yao continued, “Master Chen, since you’re exceptionally gifted and can fight above your level, you should head to the Dao Sect. The Heaven-Climbing Ladder hasn’t descended yet, and almost all the cultivators are gathered at the Dao Sect right now.”
“Once you get to the Dao Sect, Master Chen, you can arrogantly display your strength. That way, many people will fear your power and won’t dare to mess with you anymore.”
“And if you’ve got powerful backing, you can show that off too. For example, that Emperor of Sun Moon City—you could have him give you a back massage in the middle of the street. Who’d dare target you after that?”
“I reckon even the Huo family and Tang family wouldn’t dare seek revenge on you anymore…”
Listening to Hong Yao’s analysis, Chen Ping smiled faintly, “You’re telling me to act tough?”
Hong Yao nodded, “If Master Chen is genuinely formidable, then it’s just showing your true self. If you’re not, then you act like you are. Either way, the goal is to make others think twice about coming after you!”
“How do I act tough? My realm’s too low, I can’t really pull it off, can I?” Chen Ping pondered, “I do have a treasured sword here, though. Could that work?”
“I’m afraid not. A sword alone won’t do it. Not everyone can recognise its value. Does Master Chen have anything else impressive?” Hong Yao asked!
“Then I’ll pretend I have a divine beast, pretend I know immortal techniques, pretend I’m skilled in formations, pretend I can heal any injury, pretend I have a God-King Bow, pretend my backer could wipe out the Celestial Realm with one slap?” Chen Ping rattled off enthusiastically!
“No, no, Master Chen, you need to pretend something believable. Stuff like wiping out the Celestial Realm with one slap, divine beasts, God-King Bows, or knowing immortal techniques—that’s obviously nonsense and hard for people to buy into.” Hong Yao waved her hands repeatedly, urging Chen Ping not to overdo it!
“Nonsense?”
Chen Ping laughed, and with a surge of heat, he released the little Qilin Beast!
