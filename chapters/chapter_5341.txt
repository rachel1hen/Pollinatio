Chen Ping and Hu Mazi exchanged a glance, simultaneously cupping their hands in salute towards everyone. “Take care, everyone. We are leaving.”
Ling Xue looked at Chen Ping, her lips moved, wanting to say something, but in the end it only turned into one sentence. “Senior Brother, you must come back safely.”
Chen Ping looked at the tears in her eyes, his heart softened, he nodded and said. “Wait for me.”
As the words fell, spiritual power surged around the two of them, they executed the aerial technique to the extreme under their feet, their figures turned into two streams of light, flying towards the horizon.
Ling Xue watched their receding figures, tears finally could not help but fall, she raised her hand to wipe the tears, silently chanting in her heart. “Senior Brother, I will cultivate well, wait for you to come back.”
Mo Chen, Li Chunfeng, Nan Batian watched the two figures disappear into the horizon, their eyes full of solemnity.
They all knew that the path to the Sixth Heaven was far more difficult than the Fifth Heaven, the Sixth Hall of the Divine Palace and the Main Hall of the Evil Path were extremely tricky opponents.
“I hope they can be safe.” Li Chunfeng said softly.
Mo Chen nodded. “Chen Ping this child has a firm temperament, extraordinary luck, and with Master Hu’s assistance, he can surely turn danger into safety.”
After leaving Sword Saint City, Chen Ping and Hu Mazi hurried all the way towards the direction of the Sixth Heaven.
The boundary between the Fifth Heaven and the Sixth Heaven is a mountain range called “Broken Cloud Ridge”.
The mountain range towers into the clouds, shrouded in thick clouds all year round, the clouds contain rich spatial power, ordinary cultivators cannot cross at all, only those who reach the Seventh Grade of Earth Immortal Realm can barely resist the tearing of spatial power.
“Ahead is Broken Cloud Ridge.”
Chen Ping pointed to the mountain range covered by clouds ahead, said solemnly. “It is said that the spatial power inside is extremely chaotic, we need to be careful.”
Hu Mazi nodded, took out two yellow talismans from the storage bag, handed one to Chen Ping. “This is the ‘Stabilising Space Talisman’, it can help us stabilise the surrounding spatial power, reduce resistance.”
Chen Ping took the talisman, pasted it on his body.
The talisman instantly turned into a faint yellow light, enveloping his body, indeed feeling the surrounding spatial power become much milder.
The two said no more, their figures flashed, drilling into the cloud layer of Broken Cloud Ridge.
Just entering the cloud layer, they felt a strong pulling force, as if to tear their bodies apart.
The surrounding space constantly distorted, from time to time appearing black spatial cracks, emitting a palpitating aura.
“Be careful of the spatial cracks.”
Hu Mazi shouted loudly, talismans continuously shot out from his hand, rays of yellow light fell around, temporarily stabilising the spatial cracks.
Chen Ping also concentrated and was on guard, the divine dragon power circulated in his body, golden scales covered his arms, golden light surged around his body, blocking the pulling of spatial power outside.
The Dragon Slaying Sword buzzed at his side, sword qi from time to time slashed out, cutting off approaching spatial cracks.
The two shuttled difficultly in the cloud layer, the whistling wind and the “sizzling” sound of space distortion in their ears, constantly changing clouds and spatial cracks before their eyes, every step was extremely difficult.
They did not know how long it had passed, finally a sliver of light appeared ahead.
“Ahead is the Sixth Heaven.”
A flash of excitement in Hu Mazi’s eyes, he accelerated his speed.
The two rushed towards the light, passing through the last layer of clouds, the scene before their eyes instantly changed.
The sky was no longer the light blue of the Fifth Heaven, but presented a profound deep blue, clouds floating in the air like cotton wool, emitting rich immortal qi.
Below were undulating mountain ranges, covered with dense forests, roars of demon beasts from time to time came from the forests, their auras several times stronger than those in the Fifth Heaven.
“Such dense immortal qi.” Hu Mazi took a deep breath, a look of amazement on his face. “At least three times denser than the Fifth Heaven. Cultivating here, the speed can at least double.”
Chen Ping also felt the spiritual qi in the air, secretly surprised in his heart.
The immortal qi concentration in the Sixth Heaven is indeed far superior to the Fifth Heaven, no wonder the cultivators in the Sixth Heaven generally have higher cultivation than those in the Fifth Heaven.
This is just the Sixth Heaven, if to the Ninth Heaven, the Nineteenth Heaven, finally reaching the Thirty-Sixth Heaven, would not the immortal qi be so dense as to become substantial.
