Seeing the sword light mere inches away, Ming Shao could only let out a furious roar, as streams of malevolent energy burst from his body, enveloping him completely!
He was now reduced to passive defence, utterly powerless to fight back against Chen Ping!
Boom!
The sword light struck in an instant, shattering the shroud of malevolent energy around Ming Shao, sending his entire body flying backwards!
But while he was still midair, another of Chen Ping’s sword strikes came!
One slash followed by another!
Giving Ming Shao no chance to catch his breath!
Chen Ping was doing this deliberately, to break Ming Shao down, to punish him for his constant posturing!
Boom, boom, boom…
Ming Shao’s whole body was like a ball, batted back and forth by Chen Ping’s sword lights.
“Enough…”
Suddenly, Ming Shao let out an explosive shout, his body trembling violently, until his face twisted into the hideous visage of a vengeful ghost!
Opening his gaping, bloodthirsty maw, the dead cultivators on the ground transformed into wisps of black mist, all of which were sucked into Ming Shao’s body!
Seeing this, Chen Ping activated the Heart-Calming Technique, beginning to vie with Ming Shao for control of this malevolent energy!
He knew Ming Shao was using these fallen cultivators to replenish his own reserves of dark power!
After some time, the bodies of the dead cultivators on the ground had vanished, leaving only human-shaped black imprints behind!
Black mist swirled around Ming Shao, and his form gradually returned to human shape!
“Chen Ping, there was no mortal enmity between us, but today you’ve toyed with me, so don’t blame me for this!”
Ming Shao said coldly!
“Hmph, you’ve killed so many of my people, and now you say there’s no enmity?” Chen Ping snorted, “Today, I will kill you!”
“Mr. Chen, we’re here…”
At that moment, Lin Chong and the others arrived!
Having already wiped out the Qian Gate and Huo family, Lin Chong, Wuji Daoist, Li Chunfeng, Nan Batian, and the five Domain Lords—all top-tier experts—surrounded Ming Shao tightly!
Seeing this, the courage Ming Shao had just mustered vanished in an instant!
With so many people ganging up on him, no matter how many lives he had, he’d die here!
Ming Shao’s body began to tremble, his face filled with panic, not a trace of his former bravado remaining!
Ming Shao’s body began to tremble, his face filled with panic, not a trace of his former bravado remaining!
“Kill him…”
Though Ming Shao was shaking and had dropped his pretentious act, Chen Ping had no intention of sparing him!
With Chen Ping’s command, everyone slowly advanced toward Ming Shao!
The sheer pressure radiating from these people alone made Ming Shao’s legs quiver, as if he were about to wet himself!
“Kill…”
All of them charged at Ming Shao together!
Terrifying waves of energy surged forth, intent on reducing Ming Shao to ashes!
“Stop…”
With a sharp shout, a terrifying force came crashing in, instantly blocking Chen Ping and the others’ attacks!
Chen Ping and his group hurriedly looked up, spotting an elderly man rapidly approaching from the horizon!
“Father…”
Seeing this, Ming Shao cried out in overwhelming joy!
At that moment, everyone’s faces turned grim, for it was none other than Ming Tian, the Lord of the Four Nether Palaces!
Ming Tian glared at Chen Ping and the others, his expression tinged with anger, “So many of you ganging up on my son, looking to die, are you?”
Suddenly, Ming Tian raised his hand and pressed downward with force!
Boom!
The entire Dao Sect collapsed under this single strike, and the whole Wuwang Land was gripped by a terrifying pressure!
Many were forced to the ground, unable to move!
Chen Ping and his allies were equally shocked, each feeling as though their bodies were being crushed by ten thousand mountains, resisting with all their might!
Blood began to trickle from the corner of Chen Ping’s mouth, while the others gritted their teeth in defiance!
With just a wave of his hand, Ming Tian had made them all feel the breath of death, a testament to the terrifying power of the Four Nether Palaces’ Lord!
Seeing this, Ming Shao reverted to his old, swaggering self!
“Chen Ping, still trying to act tough with me? With a flick of my father’s hand, he’ll turn all of you to dust!”
Ming Shao said, staring at Chen Ping with his usual pretentious smirk!
