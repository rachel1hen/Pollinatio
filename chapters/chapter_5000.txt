Hearing this, Gadfly grew worried about Chen Ping’s safety!
After all, Chen Ping had come to Flying Tiger City to save his son, only to find himself in danger.
Although Chen Ping was very powerful, he was still on Flying Tiger City’s turf, and even a hero could be overwhelmed by numbers.
If anything happened to Chen Ping, Gadfly would feel uneasy.
“Gadfly, don’t think about letting your son escape. Your defeat is certain, and no one’s getting away,” Jie Zhong said smugly, looking at Gadfly.
Gadfly’s eight guardians were nearly out of fighting strength, and his tens of thousands of soldiers had suffered heavy losses, making them no match for Flying Tiger City.
Gadfly stared coldly at Jie Zhong, puzzled, “Jie Zhong, your Flying Tiger City has never been a match for my Rhino City. Yet, in such a short time, your city’s strength has grown so much.”
“Hahaha, I have a powerful backer. From now on, Flying Tiger City will no longer be bullied by your Rhino City, and I’ll become the overlord of the entire Beast Clan!”
Jie Zhong laughed heartily.
“City Lord Niu, Flying Tiger City is backed by the Temple. They’ve also raided Cangxuan Continent, seizing vast resources and slaves, which is why their strength has grown so quickly,” Bai Yi explained to Gadfly.
Gadfly frowned at this, “Jie Zhong, you’re a prominent city lord among the Beast Clan, yet you’re controlled by humans. Have you no shame?”
“Nonsense! The Temple’s people are divine, not human. How could I be controlled by mere humans?”
“Cangxuan Continent is the largest human continent, yet I’ve plundered heaps of resources and slaves from it.”
“Not just the Beast Clan, I’ll become the overlord of the entire First Heaven…” Jie Zhong grew more excited, as if his ambitions were within reach.
“You? You’re not worthy!” Gadfly spat fiercely.
“If you’re not convinced, let’s fight again!”
Jie Zhong roared, and his black-clad soldiers instantly leapt forward, charging at Gadfly and his men!
“Engage…” Seeing this, Gadfly could only shout.
Now, they had no choice but to fight to the death.
He had miscalculated, never expecting Flying Tiger City’s strength to grow so rapidly, and he’d suffered a great loss!
But just as Gadfly spoke, the void trembled, and two sword beams slashed through swiftly.
Like meteors, they crossed a hundred metres in an instant.
The heads of two black-clad soldiers flew high, then crashed to the ground.
Swish…
Two more sword beams, and two more soldiers’ heads fell.
Seeing this, Jie Zhong was stunned, unable to comprehend who could have such skill.
But he intended to intervene!
If this continued, his elite soldiers would all be killed.
Gadfly, overjoyed, leapt forward as Jie Zhong moved to act, ignoring his injuries and unleashing his full strength.
Boom!
With an explosive sound, Jie Zhong and Gadfly both staggered back.
By now, over a dozen black-clad soldiers were dead, their fighting strength drastically reduced.
And no one had seen who struck, the men simply died.
It was practically an instant kill!
“Who is it? Who’s there? Show yourself!” Jie Zhong’s face changed, roaring in fury!
Then, Chen Ping and Hu Mazi’s figures slowly appeared, along with Young Master Huo.
Seeing this, Jie Zhong frowned, “Young Master Huo? You… you…”
Young Master Huo hung his head silently, either too scared to speak or unconscious.
“Big brother, are you alright?” Gadfly hurried to Chen Ping, asking.
“I’m fine. Flying Tiger City’s strength can’t touch me!” Chen Ping smiled faintly.
