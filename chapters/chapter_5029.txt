Chen Ping sheathed his Dragon-Slaying Sword, coldly eyeing Huo Zhao: “Keep your promise, take your people, and get out of Cangxuan Continent!”
“I can leave, but you must release my children, otherwise, even if I have to sacrifice all of the Eight Halls, I will wipe out the entire Cangxuan Continent.”
Huo Zhao said to Chen Ping!
“No way, if I release everyone and you don’t leave, continuing to slaughter in Cangxuan Continent, what then?”
“I can only release one of them, to show my sincerity, you choose!”
Chen Ping said to Huo Zhao!
Hearing this, Huo Zhao looked at his son and daughter, finding it hard to choose!
“Father, save me, please save me, my sister was just captured, but I’ve been locked up for days.”
“I don’t want to die, nor suffer in captivity, please save me!”
Young Master Huo shouted desperately, hoping Huo Zhao would rescue him.
Seeing this, Huo Jingjing spoke to Huo Zhao: “Father, save my brother, I’ll be their hostage, I believe they won’t dare do anything to me.”
Huo Zhao could only nod, and Chen Ping, seeing this, waved his hand, ordering Young Master Huo’s release.
The moment he was freed, Young Master Huo immediately revealed a ferocious expression.
“Chen Ping, you dared to capture me, just you wait, our Divine Hall is not something you can challenge.”
“I’ll make you wish you were dead…”
Young Master Huo said arrogantly!
Looking at his haughty demeanour, Chen Ping smirked coldly: “If you don’t want to leave, believe me, I can capture you again right now?”
“Don’t forget, even your father is my defeated foe, if I want to capture you, no one can stop me!”
Hearing this, Young Master Huo immediately shut his mouth, hurriedly pulling Huo Zhao: “Father, let’s go, let’s leave quickly…”
Huo Zhao looked at Chen Ping coldly: “Chen Ping, if my daughter loses even a single hair, I won’t spare you.”
“Even if you defeated me, behind me is the entire Divine Hall, and behind the Divine Hall is the entire Divine Clan, you can’t afford to provoke them.”
“Rest assured, as long as you don’t target Cangxuan Continent, your daughter will be fine,” Chen Ping said calmly!
“Fine, I won’t target Cangxuan Continent, but I won’t let you off!” Huo Zhao said sinisterly!
“Whatever, even if you let me off, I don’t plan on letting the Divine Hall off,” Chen Ping said casually!
“Jingjing, take care of yourself!” Huo Zhao said, then left with the Eight Halls’ people!
After Huo Zhao’s departure, the cultivators of Cangxuan Continent knelt before Chen Ping!
It was Chen Ping who saved the entire Cangxuan Continent, sparing them from slaughter and enslavement.
Mo Qingyun looked at Chen Ping with eyes full of admiration and envy.
A mere first-rank Loose Immortal with such strength.
In a world where the strong reign supreme, Chen Ping’s first-rank Loose Immortal status might be looked down upon, but the strength he displayed was genuinely enviable.
“Take us to see your Mysterious Lady!”
Chen Ping said to the man from Cangxuan Continent who had first approached them!
“Yes, yes, yes…” The man nodded repeatedly, “Senior Chen, please follow me…”
Chen Ping and his group leaped into the air with the man, heading toward the palace where Blue Lotus resided!
The cultivators of Cangxuan Continent only stood up slowly after Chen Ping and his group had left!
An elderly cultivator murmured: “It was Senior Chen who saved us, saved our entire Cangxuan Continent…”
“We must erect a golden statue for him, to be worshipped by generations…”
Meanwhile, Chen Ping, unaware of the plans to erect a statue in his honour, was still on his way to meet Blue Lotus.
Mo Qingyun would occasionally steal glances at Chen Ping.
Though their acquaintance was brief, at this moment, Mo Qingyun felt she might be developing feelings for Chen Ping.
Especially when Chen Ping, a first-rank Loose Immortal, fought Huo Zhao, a fifth-rank Loose Immortal, he was simply breathtaking.
Meanwhile, Hu Mazi, looking at the subdued Huo Jingjing, couldn’t stop drooling.
After all, with Huo Jingjing in that tight outfit, which man wouldn’t react!
