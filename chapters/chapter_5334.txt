He himself turned into a black arrow and charged towards Hu Mazi. In his hand, a bone dagger quenched with deadly poison had appeared at some point; it aimed straight for Hu Mazi’s heart.
Hu Mazi was already prepared. He snorted coldly and advanced instead of retreating. Three talismans flashing with golden light appeared in his hand in an instant. “Incorrigible!”
He blocked with the talismans in front of him; the talismans instantly transformed into a huge golden shield. The shield was engraved with the words “Suppress Evil” and emitted a majestic heavenly might.
“Puff!”
The bone dagger stabbed into the golden shield like a clay ox entering the sea; it was instantly shattered by the golden light on the shield.
You Wuxie himself was also shaken by the tremendous rebound force and flew backwards. He crashed heavily in front of the palace gate; black blood continuously spurted from his mouth. It was clear he would not survive.
Hu Mazi panted heavily and walked step by step to him. His eyes were ice-cold; talismans swirled around his body. “The divine souls of my Hu clan; where exactly are they?”
You Wuxie struggled to open his eyes and looked at Hu Mazi. His eyes were full of venom. “You… you won’t find them… They… they are in the main hall…”
“Main hall?”
Hu Mazi’s eyes narrowed; the aura on his body became even more violent. “Speak clearly! Where exactly is it?”
You Wuxie coughed; black blood overflowed from the corner of his mouth. His voice was weak but carried a trace of mockery. “Branch hall… the branch hall only has some insignificant divine souls… Strong ones like those of the Hu clan… were all sent to the main hall… As… as for whether they have been refined… I… I don’t know…”
Before his words finished, his head tilted to one side; he was completely lifeless.
Hu Mazi looked at his corpse; his eyes were full of rage and unwillingness. He waved his arm fiercely; several explosive talismans landed on You Wuxie’s corpse. With a “boom” of a loud explosion, the corpse was instantly blasted to pieces. “Bastard!”
At that moment, a scream came from inside the palace; a figure stumbled out. It was none other than You Yue.
She had obviously been alarmed by the fighting sounds outside. At this moment, seeing the ground full of corpses and the two, Chen and Hu, she turned pale with fright and wanted to run away.
“Thinking of running?”
Hu Mazi’s eyes turned cold; his figure flickered and instantly blocked in front of her. At the same time, he released a immobilisation talisman; the talisman landed on You Yue’s body, and her body stiffened. She could not move.
Hu Mazi grabbed her hair and slammed her harshly to the ground.
You Yue fell in a daze; the effect of the immobilisation talisman also dissipated.
She looked up and saw Hu Mazi’s face full of anger; she was scared out of her wits and begged repeatedly. “Spare me… Uncle Hu, spare me… I don’t know anything… Please let me go…”
Hu Mazi looked at her pitiful appearance; yet there was not the slightest pity in his eyes, only deep-seated hatred.
This You Yue had been played by him until she screamed; Hu Mazi had thought she would submit. Yet unexpectedly, she still wanted his life!
“Let you go?”
Hu Mazi sneered; his voice was like it came from the nine nether hells. “Today, I will fuck you to death?”
Hu Mazi tore open her black robe with one hand and exposed the pale skin underneath.
You Yue screamed and struggled; but in the face of Hu Mazi’s immense strength, she was as powerless as an ant.
She looked at the undisguised rage and killing intent in Hu Mazi’s eyes; her heart was filled with fear. She cried and shouted. “No… Please… No…”
But Hu Mazi had already been overwhelmed by anger and the hatred suppressed for many days. He hoisted You Yue onto his shoulder and strode towards the depths of the palace; he left behind cries full of despair echoing in the valley.
Chen Ping watched this scene and did not stop it.
He knew that Hu Mazi had too much pain and hatred accumulated in his heart; You Yue deserved it. Some debts must be repaid with blood.
He turned and walked towards those black-robed cultivators who were still resisting stubbornly; he wielded the Dragon Slaying Sword. The golden flames were like the scythe of the god of death; they turned one evil cultivator after another into charred remains.
