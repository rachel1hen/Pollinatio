“So that’s how it is…” Chen Ping murmured, a flash of understanding in his eyes.
He stopped rushing to attack, instead observing the man’s movements closely, trying to grasp the mystery hidden behind that power.
Seeing Chen Ping no longer taking the offensive, the man snorted coldly, raised his giant axe high, and swung it down fiercely.
Where the axe blade passed, space itself seemed to tear, leaving a pitch-black rift hurtling toward Chen Ping.
Chen Ping’s expression sharpened, and with a flash of his body, he narrowly dodged the strike.
He felt the destructive force within that axe blade, heightening his caution but also sparking excitement.
He knew this was a rare opportunity. If he could comprehend it, his strength would rise to a new level.
“Come again!”
Chen Ping shouted once more, swinging the Dragon-Slaying Sword, its aura arcing like a rainbow to clash with the man’s giant axe again.
This time, he didn’t just meet force with force. He tried blending his spiritual energy with his sword intent, seeking the subtle profundity within the fight.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
The battle grew fiercer, the air filled with wild energy fluctuations.
Chen Ping’s figure flickered through the sky, the sword aura of the Dragon-Slaying Sword weaving with the man’s giant axe, bursting into dazzling light.
As the fight dragged on, Chen Ping’s movements became smoother, his sword intent more refined.
He felt himself brushing against the edge of a certain realm—a mysterious state beyond mere strength.
“So, power isn’t just brute force, but an understanding and application of the laws of heaven and earth…”
Clarity dawned in Chen Ping’s heart, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.
He stopped defending passively and took the initiative, the Dragon-Slaying Sword’s aura growing sharper, each strike carrying a mysterious rhythm.
The man sensed Chen Ping’s shift, his expression twitching slightly.
He hadn’t expected this seemingly weak cultivator to grow stronger mid-battle, even starting to threaten him.
“Kid, you’re interesting!”
The man sneered, swinging his giant axe with greater ferocity, aiming to crush Chen Ping with sheer power.
But Chen Ping was no longer the same as when the fight began.
His sword intent sharpened further, each blow infused with the power of heaven’s laws, faintly gaining the upper hand against the man’s axe.
Boom!
Another fierce clash, and both the Dragon-Slaying Sword and the giant axe were knocked back.
Chen Ping retreated with the momentum, a trace of confidence in his eyes. He knew he’d found the way to defeat the man.
“Next, it’s over!”
Chen Ping growled, his spiritual energy surging wildly. The Dragon-Slaying Sword’s aura exploded, forming a massive sword shadow that shot toward the man.
Feeling the terrifying power in that shadow, the man’s face paled, and he hurriedly raised his axe to block.
But this time, his giant axe couldn’t fully stop Chen Ping’s sword aura.
Boom!
The sword shadow struck, sending the man’s axe flying and forcing him back hundreds of meters.
He glanced down at a shallow sword mark on his chest, shock flickering in his eyes.
“You’re not third-grade Transcendence Realm. You hid your strength and actually managed to wound me?”
The man stared at Chen Ping in disbelief, a hint of wariness in his tone.
“You only noticed now? Seems a bit late!”
Chen Ping said with a faint smile!
“You little punk, hiding your realm to catch me off guard. What a dirty trick…”
The man grumbled, clearly displeased!
Chen Ping smiled lightly, his eyes brimming with confidence, “Let’s keep going. It’s only just begun.”
Before his words fully faded, he swung his sword again, its aura like a rainbow, bearing down on the man.
This time, his sword intent was even more refined, each strike carrying the force of heaven’s laws, leaving the man struggling to keep up.
The battle intensified, Chen Ping’s sword intent growing stronger.
He felt himself teetering on the edge of a breakthrough—a mysterious state transcending raw power.
Finally, with one decisive slash, Chen Ping sent the man’s giant axe flying and forced him back thousands of meters.
The man looked down at a deep sword gash across his chest, a trace of resignation in his eyes.
“Kid, you win.”
He sighed, “You can go to the next tier…”
