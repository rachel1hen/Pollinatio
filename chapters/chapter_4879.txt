“Mr. Chen, what is this?” Mu Sha asked curiously!
“It’s the jade slip of the Heaven and Earth Array, as long as this slip is activated, the Heaven and Earth Array will appear!”
“When I break that array, you’ll all be able to return to the Heavenly Realm!”
Chen Ping said, gazing at the jade slip in his hand!
Li Chunfeng and Shen Zhiyan’s eyes burned with excitement, if the Heaven and Earth Array were broken, they’d truly be free!
“Brother Chen, you get on with it, we’ll head to the fifth level for a look around…”
Ning Zhi said to Chen Ping!
“Be careful, Brother Ning!” Chen Ping nodded!
Ning Zhi took Su Yuqi to the fifth level, while Chen Ping began activating the fourth jade slip!
As Chen Ping held the slip, its glow grew stronger, as if a tremendous force was about to burst forth.
He took a deep breath, channelling his spiritual energy continuously into the jade slip.
As the energy poured in, the ancient runes on the slip began to flicker and dance, emitting a low hum.
In an instant, a blinding beam of light shot into the sky, spreading outwards with Chen Ping at its centre.
The heavens seemed to be torn apart by an invisible giant hand, and a massive, mysterious array slowly took shape.
Above the array, runes flowed, lines intertwined, exuding an aura that made hearts tremble.
Across the Celestial Realm, no matter what the cultivators were doing, they all stopped in their tracks, looking up at the sky now shrouded by the Heaven and Earth Array.
Some were so shocked their mouths wouldn’t close, their magical tools slipping from their hands unnoticed; others gazed with awe, dropping to one knee and saluting the array; still others showed greed in their eyes, as if calculating the opportunities hidden within it.
“What… what is this? Such incredible power!” an elderly white-haired elder said, his voice trembling, he’d cultivated for centuries but had never witnessed such a sight.
“Could it be the legendary Heaven and Earth Array?” a young cultivator said excitedly, clenching his fists, his eyes blazing with fervour.
“It’s appeared, the Heaven and Earth Array has appeared, Senior Brother, we’ll soon be able to return to the Heavenly Realm!”
Zhen Mo looked at the array, bouncing with excitement like a child!
The Ancestor of Divine Patterns gazed up at the array in the sky, tears streaming down his aged face!
In the far north, Yan Mo, cloaked in flames, looked up at the Heaven and Earth Array, his emotions overwhelming!
At this moment in the Celestial Realm, countless cultivators trapped from the Heavenly Realm were beside themselves with joy, thousands of years, thousands of years of waiting!
The Heaven and Earth Array had finally appeared, now they just awaited the one who would break it, then they’d truly be free!
As Chen Ping looked at the activated Heaven and Earth Array before him, his heart held both a flicker of excitement and a faint unease.
He knew full well that the activation of this array would spark a massive upheaval, and he was already at the centre of this storm.
“Mr. Chen, the Heaven and Earth Array has appeared, can you break it now?” Li Chunfeng asked Chen Ping excitedly.
Chen Ping shook his head, “Right now, I’ve only made the array appear, as for how to break it, I still need to study it.”
“Mr. Chen, you study it, we’ll guard you!”
Shen Zhiyan said, equally thrilled!
“Alright!” Chen Ping nodded, then his figure slowly floated into the air, his eyes fixed on the Heaven and Earth Array, entering a state of complete focus!
Meanwhile, in the Fire Incineration Sect, Wen Haotian suddenly opened his eyes, his brows furrowing deeply!
“Ancestor, the Heaven and Earth Array has appeared, it seems someone is trying to break it!”
Wen Nanxing entered the secret chamber and reported to Wen Haotian!
“Stop him, the time isn’t right yet, we can’t let the Heaven and Earth Array be broken!”
Wen Haotian glanced at the bronze coffin, then ordered Wen Nanxing!
“Yes!” Wen Nanxing nodded!
Soon, within the Fire Incineration Sect, a large group of cultivators, led by Wen Nanxing, headed straight for the Land of No Return, among them were the Wen Qing and Wen Shi siblings!
Those siblings had fled back during Chen Ping’s fierce battle with the Four Nether Mansions!
