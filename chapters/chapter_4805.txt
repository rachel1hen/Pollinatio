Just after Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi left, two more figures arrived at the tavern!
Their attire was strikingly similar to Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi’s, clad in fiery red robes that made them look as if they were engulfed in flames!
Also a man and a woman, though the aura they exuded differed slightly from Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi’s!
“That Chen Ping guy just now, he doesn’t leave any room for courtesy, killing a Qian Sect elder without a second thought, I’m afraid his troubles will only pile up from here.”
The man spoke first!
“Brother, I actually think Chen Ping did the right thing, acting this way was to deter others, if he hadn’t killed that Qian Sect elder, more and more people would come looking for trouble, and that’d get exhausting.”
“Better to kill the Qian Sect elder, make others fear him and think twice before crossing him, though I’ll admit, one-shotting a third-grade Transcendent Immortal was beyond my expectations.”
The woman chimed in!
The man sneered, “Sure, it scared off others, but it also thoroughly pissed off the Qian Sect, and don’t forget, the Qian Sect isn’t just one sect, the Triple Alliance’s combined strength isn’t weak.”
“Now that a Qian Sect elder’s been killed, how could they let it slide? If the Triple Alliance issues a kill order, this Chen Ping guy will have offended both the Huo family and the Triple Alliance, can he still hold his ground in Wuwang Land?”
The woman, however, smiled, “If Chen Ping were just a lone cultivator, he might fear the Triple Alliance, but didn’t you notice? That girl by his side is Lin Keting, the princess of Sun Moon City.”
“And I also spotted quite a few people in the crowd worrying about him, probably his allies.”
“If Chen Ping’s tied to Sun Moon City, what’s there to fear from the Triple Alliance?”
The man fell silent, gazing faintly out the window, “Is he really connected to Sun Moon City? If so, we’d better tread carefully and avoid provoking this guy.”
“With Father still in seclusion, we need to keep a low profile for now…”
“Even if Father doesn’t come out, Sun Moon City’s no match for our Fire Incineration Sect, especially since you and I now wield divine weapons crafted by the Refining Sect’s master himself, who in the Celestial Realm can stand against us?” The woman slowly drew her sword as she spoke!
The blade was etched with flame patterns, and the moment it left its sheath, the entire tavern felt like it was ablaze!
“Wenqing, put that sword away, how can you flash a divine weapon like that so casually?”
The man barked angrily!
Seeing his reaction, the woman sheathed the sword!
At that moment, several cultivators in black robes, each with a vivid red flame embroidered on their chests, walked in!
“Young Master, Young Lady, everything’s ready, you can go rest now!”
One of the cultivators stepped forward and said!
“Hmm…”
The man nodded, then led the woman downstairs!
“Without my orders, none of you are to provoke that Chen Ping guy, if the chance arises, you can even lend him a hand!”
As they descended, the man instructed his subordinates!
“Yes, sir!” The group nodded in unison!
“Brother, why’s that? We’ve got no ties to Chen Ping, why help him?”
Wenqing asked, utterly baffled!
“Just building some goodwill, that guy’s future achievements won’t be small.”
“A mere third-grade Mahayana cultivator, yet he took down a third-grade Transcendent Immortal with one strike, how could an ordinary person pull that off?”
“Plus, that sword in his hand, it seems to share the same lineage as our divine weapons…”
The man explained!
“What? You mean the sword he’s got was forged by the Refining Sect too? Does he have ties to them?”
Wenqing was shocked!
“Not necessarily, but we’d best play it safe and not cross him!”
With that, the man walked off!
