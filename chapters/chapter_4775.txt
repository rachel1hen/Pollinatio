“How… how is this possible?”
Huo Ming couldn’t believe what was happening!
“Young Master…” Steward Lu stared in shock, daring only to shout, not move a muscle!
Where did that white light come from?
No one saw it clearly, and no one knew!
Chen Ping, on the other hand, looked coldly at the pierced Huo Ming and said, “I warned you, but you just wouldn’t listen…”
Hua Yueying and Cang Yue stared at Chen Ping, their eyes wide with astonishment!
“Damn, is Mr. Chen this amazing?”
“He’s truly a god-like figure…”
These two had no idea that Emperor Xiao’s dynasty had been blessed with fortune by Master Shi!
Xuan Bin and Zhou Tang simply smiled faintly. They had been guarding Emperor Xiao’s dynasty for many days and knew that no one could resort to violence within its borders!
“This is nothing. Even if an immortal came to Emperor Xiao’s dynasty, they’d have to behave, or they’d be executed…”
Emperor Xiao Yuan Shan spoke with immense pride at this moment.
As the emperor, his dynasty was a sanctuary in the mortal realm. Anyone who dared to act out of line in Emperor Xiao’s dynasty would face dire consequences!
Emperor Xiao’s words left Hua Yueying and the others even more stunned.
Even immortals would be executed? Emperor Xiao’s dynasty was truly formidable!
“Was this the work of the expert behind you?” Huo Ming asked Chen Ping.
“No,” Chen Ping shook his head.
“No?” Huo Ming frowned.
“If Master Shi had personally intervened, you would have been reduced to ashes already. This was merely a trace of fortune left by Master Shi.”
Chen Ping explained truthfully.
“Incredible…” Huo Ming had to admit now that the expert behind Chen Ping was indeed formidable.
“We’ll leave and never trouble you again…”
Huo Ming had lost all his initial ambition and now only wanted to escape this place.
“Fine…” Chen Ping nodded.
Huo Ming, dragging his severely injured body, slowly retreated, then turned to leave.
Seeing this, Chen Ping raised his hand and slashed!
Whoosh!
The Dragon-Slaying Sword released a blade of light, directly severing Huo Ming’s head!
The Dragon-Slaying Sword released a blade of light, directly severing Huo Ming’s head!
Huo Ming’s head soared into the air, his eyes glaring furiously at Chen Ping.
“You think you can come and go as you please, treating this place like an inn?”
Chen Ping sneered coldly.
He was echoing the words of the Tenth Hall Master.
“Big brother…” Huo Qing, seeing his brother’s head severed, roared in rage.
“Young Master!” Steward Lu also looked grief-stricken, then turned to Chen Ping and demanded, “Didn’t you agree to let our young master leave?”
“All’s fair in war…” Chen Ping calmly uttered these four words.
Huo Ming’s body collapsed heavily to the ground, and Chen Ping walked over, rummaging through the corpse for a storage pouch.
Huo Qing and Steward Lu watched this scene, their teeth gritted in hatred, but none dared to move.
“The Huo family is truly wealthy…”
Chen Ping smiled as he looked at Huo Ming’s storage pouch.
Steward Lu glanced at Huo Ming’s corpse, then turned and left.
If they didn’t leave now, they might never get another chance.
Seeing this, the Tenth Hall Master also turned and left. He had started to leave the moment Huo Ming’s body was pierced by the white light.
Huo Qing, however, was filled with resentment, his teeth grinding audibly.
“Young Master, let’s go. We’ll avenge the elder young master later!”
Steward Lu pulled Huo Qing, and they quickly disappeared into the horizon.
With everyone gone, peace returned to the skies above Emperor Xiao’s dynasty.
“Mr. Chen, why didn’t you kill all of them?”
Hua Yueying asked Chen Ping, puzzled.
“I wanted to, but it’s not up to me!”
Chen Ping sighed helplessly. These people were not ones he could handle; only Master Shi could deal with them.
But whether Master Shi would intervene was beyond Chen Ping’s control.
“After this, the Tenth Hall and the others will likely behave for a while.”
Xuan Bin breathed a sigh of relief.
“Thanks to everyone’s help this time, let’s divide these resources among ourselves.”
Chen Ping then took out Huo Ming’s storage pouch and distributed the various resources inside.
