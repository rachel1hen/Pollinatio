“My name is Aisha, I’m from Cangxuan Continent. Our continent was plundered by Flying Tiger City. They not only looted our resources but also captured tens of thousands of people to serve as slaves.”
“I barely managed to escape from that dungeon. Please, save me. If you help me get out, my father, the emperor, will surely reward you generously.”
Aisha pleaded with Chen Ping.
Chen Ping was surprised to learn that Aisha was actually a princess.
“Don’t talk nonsense. Cangxuan Continent is protected by natural barriers and countless arrays. For years, no one has ever invaded it. How could a mere Flying Tiger City plunder your continent?”
Bai Yi spoke up.
“Father-in-law, you know about Cangxuan Continent?” Chen Ping asked curiously.
“Of course. Cangxuan Continent is the richest and most resource-abundant place in human territory. Many human experts gather there.”
“Let alone one Flying Tiger City, even when the King of Ten Thousand Beasts rallied the forces of several beast clan cities to attack Cangxuan Continent years ago, they returned empty-handed.”
Bai Yi explained to Chen Ping!
Chen Ping felt Bai Yi’s words made sense and looked at Aisha with doubt, curious to hear how she would explain.
“If it were just Flying Tiger City, they indeed couldn’t have breached Cangxuan Continent. But they had the help of some mysterious people. These individuals were extremely powerful, and both the natural barriers and arrays were destroyed, allowing Flying Tiger City to invade our continent.”
Aisha explained!
Upon hearing this, Chen Ping immediately understood. Those mysterious people must be from the Temple. Flying Tiger City had likely become a pawn of the Temple, receiving their aid to invade Cangxuan Continent.
“Alright, enough talk. Let’s figure out how to get out of here first!”
Chen Ping knew that, though this place was hidden, it wasn’t safe. They could be found at any moment.
So, he put his helmet back on, and the four of them escorted Aisha out from their hiding spot!
Since they were dressed in battle soldier armour, no one suspected them as they escorted Aisha.
But just as Chen Ping and his group were heading toward the city gate with Aisha, a squad of battle soldiers suddenly blocked their path.
One of the captains said, “Didn’t expect you to catch her. Hand her over to me, and you lot can go rest.”
“Captain, we caught her. Why should we hand her over to you?”
Chen Ping retorted!
“Insolent! I’m the captain, and you dare defy me? Do you want to die?”
The captain roared, stepping forward to kick Chen Ping.
Swish…
But as the captain approached, a flash of cold light gleamed!
Chen Ping struck, his Dragon-Slaying Sword slashing out, sending the captain’s head flying high into the air.
Seeing Chen Ping act, Mad Immortal, Bai Yi, and Aisha also sprang into action.
They had to eliminate this squad as quickly as possible to prevent them from sounding the alarm.
Unfortunately, no matter how fast they were, one soldier, in his final moments, let out a piercing alarm.
Instantly, large numbers of battle soldiers from all directions in the city surged toward Chen Ping and his group.
“What do we do?” Aisha asked, her face full of panic.
“Follow me…”
Seeing this, Chen Ping led the group toward Young Master Huo’s mansion.
With soldiers closing in from all sides, their only option was to head to the mansion and try the teleportation array. If they could teleport to that small city, they might find a way to escape!
Upon entering the mansion, they found no guards inside, it was completely empty. In the central courtyard, there was a circular array, clearly a teleportation array.
Chen Ping and the others shed their armour. Since their cover was blown, the heavy armour was no longer useful.
“Big brother, can you operate this teleportation array?”
Mad Immortal asked!
