Inside a grand palace in Cangxuan Continent!
Blue Lotus furrowed her brows, her heart filled with anxiety!
After such a long time, Mo Qingyun still hadn’t arrived. Without the Mo family’s help, Cangxuan Continent alone could never withstand the Eight Halls’ attack.
“Mysterious Lady, is the help you called for coming or not? If we keep waiting, who knows how many of Cangxuan Continent’s people will perish at the hands of the Divine Hall,” the King of Dongmeng Kingdom asked anxiously!
“Wait a little longer, they should be here soon!” Blue Lotus said!
“Mysterious Lady, I can’t wait any longer. Our Dongmeng Kingdom is already under the iron hooves of the Divine Hall. If we don’t act, I fear not a single piece of our kingdom will remain,” the King of Dongmeng Kingdom said, unable to wait any longer!
“What do you plan to do?” Ashinu asked!
“Since we’re no match, we can only submit. We can’t just watch everyone die,” the King of Dongmeng Kingdom said!
“You traitor, I knew you’d surrender. I’ll cut you down first…” Ashinu said, about to take action.
“Enough, isn’t it chaotic enough already?” Blue Lotus shouted angrily!
At this, no one spoke further, all quietly looking at Blue Lotus, wondering what plan she had.
But what plan could Blue Lotus have? She could only wait.
Yet with every passing moment, more cultivators of Cangxuan Continent were dying.
Just then, someone burst in, excitedly saying: “Mysterious Lady, they’ve retreated, they’ve all retreated…”
“What’s retreated?” Blue Lotus asked, utterly confused.
“The people from the Divine Hall have withdrawn, they’ve all left our Cangxuan Continent…” the messenger said!
“What happened?” Blue Lotus exclaimed with joy!
“I’m not sure!” The messenger shook his head!
The other three kings, upon hearing this, were equally shocked. They couldn’t fathom why the Divine Hall’s people had suddenly withdrawn.
“I know, it must be the help I called for, it must be her who drove the Divine Hall’s people away,” Blue Lotus suddenly said, her eyes lighting up.
As Blue Lotus spoke, a powerful aura approached, slowly descending before the palace gates.
“Mysterious Lady, your friends seek an audience…” the man who had brought Chen Ping and the others said loudly.
“Hahaha, it really is her,” Blue Lotus said with delight, quickly adding: “Let them in…”
Mo Qingyun led Chen Ping and the others inside!
Upon seeing Blue Lotus, Mo Qingyun rushed forward, and the two embraced tightly.
“Qingyun, thank you so much. If it weren’t for your help, I’m afraid Cangxuan Continent would have been completely overtaken by the Divine Hall’s people,” Blue Lotus said!
“Don’t thank me, I didn’t do anything, it’s all Chen Ping’s doing,” Mo Qingyun said, pointing at Chen Ping!
“Chen Ping?” Blue Lotus curiously sized up Chen Ping, noticing he was only a first-rank Loose Immortal, and her face immediately filled with doubt.
“Don’t judge him by his rank, his strength is formidable. The master of the Eight Halls, a fifth-rank Loose Immortal, was defeated by him and forced to surrender.”
“That’s why those people withdrew from Cangxuan Continent…” Mo Qingyun, knowing what Blue Lotus was thinking, explained.
“Mysterious Lady, is this the help you called for? I think the Divine Hall’s people leaving has nothing to do with them,” the King of Dongmeng Kingdom said with a cold snort after a quick glance!
In his eyes, the strongest among them was only Mo Qingyun, at the peak of third-rank Loose Immortal.
Hu Mazi and Chen Ping’s ranks were even lower.
He simply didn’t believe that these few people could have driven out the Divine Hall’s forces.
Blue Lotus didn’t speak, as she too found it hard to believe, given their low ranks.
She had expected Mo Qingyun to bring experts from the Mo family to help, not just these two people.
