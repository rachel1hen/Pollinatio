“And why do those guards call you Market Master?”
Bai Yi smiled faintly, “Because this black market is called Spirit Fox Market, and I’m its master, so naturally they call me Market Master.”
“What?” Chen Ping’s face was full of shock.
He never could have imagined that Bai Qian’s father, his father-in-law, controlled such a massive black market in Rhino City.
Didn’t that mean he could do whatever he wanted in this black market, backed by his father-in-law’s influence?
Hu Mazi and Xiu Rui hurried forward, asking the stunned Chen Ping, “Chen Ping, your father-in-law has such power, why didn’t you ever mention it?”
Chen Ping was speechless, what could he say?
He had only just learned he had such a father-in-law.
And only just discovered that his father-in-law ran such a huge black market.
“Come with me…”
Bai Yi said, then lightly leapt into one of the floating rooms!
Seeing this, Chen Ping and the others followed him into the room.
Inside, the room was opulent, and through its windows, they could clearly see the entire black market.
“Son-in-law, what do you think of my place?” Bai Yi asked with a slight smile.
“It’s more than impressive! I never imagined Father-in-law was so formidable, building such a force in just a few centuries,” Chen Ping praised.
But Bai Yi chuckled, “Running a black market? Some force that is, there are over a dozen markets of this scale in Rhino City alone.”
“To be honest, I’m just working for those noble families, handling the dirty work they can’t deal with publicly.”
“When it comes to real power, who in Rhino City can compare to the City Lord…”
Chen Ping listened, deeply impressed, mainly because Rhino City was so vast, with over a dozen black markets of this size.
“Father-in-law, what about the Long family’s influence in Rhino City? I think I offended someone from the Long family last night.”
Chen Ping recalled Long Qi and asked.
“That Long Qi you defeated last night, don’t mind his posturing, the Long family’s influence is negligible. If the Long family comes after you, I can handle it.”
“Think about it, if they were truly powerful, would they need to cheat in the arena to get into the City Lord’s Mansion?”
“The truly influential families in Rhino City don’t need such hassle, they’d have already placed their heirs in the mansion.”
Bai Yi said with a scornful smile.
Chen Ping thought about it and realised it made sense, truly powerful families wouldn’t need to cheat in the arena.
It was like the scions of prominent families in the mortal world, who would bother competing with ordinary people for civil service exams and cheating to get in?
A single phone call, a meal, and the spot would be secured, practically tailor-made, no names needed.
“So he was just bluffing, then I’ve got nothing to worry about.”
In truth, Chen Ping had been concerned about Long Qi’s potential retaliation.
After all, he was in unfamiliar territory, and Hu Mazi and Xiu Rui were both human, if their identities were exposed, they’d have no standing in Rhino City.
“With me backing you, as long as you don’t go overboard and offend some major figure, you’ll be fine.”
“But your two human friends must never reveal their human identities, or no one will be able to protect them.”
Bai Yi cautioned Chen Ping.
“Don’t worry, Father-in-law, I’ll make sure they’re careful.”
“I’m going to try my luck in the arena, win a few rounds!” Chen Ping said, itching to get started.
Though he might not win using his full strength, relying solely on physical power and resilience, these opponents were mere small fry to him.
“Try, my foot! This is my market, if you go up there and scare everyone off, no one will come back, you’d be wrecking my business!”
Bai Yi scolded Chen Ping.
