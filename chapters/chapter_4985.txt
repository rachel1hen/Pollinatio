Chen Ping and his group hurriedly returned to the city!
At this point, the city was already in utter chaos, with large numbers of soldiers running through the streets.
Chen Ping’s brow furrowed slightly, he knew they had to break out as quickly as possible, as Young Master Huo was surely pursuing them through the teleportation array with his men.
However, with so many soldiers, it would not be easy for Chen Ping and his small group to escape.
“Niu Ben, is there a way to contact your father?”
Chen Ping wanted to reach Niu Fei, to have him launch an attack on Flying Tiger City!
If Niu Fei led an assault on Flying Tiger City, the city’s soldiers would surely be urgently redeployed.
This would significantly reduce the pressure on Chen Ping and his group.
When Chen Ping arrived, he forgot to give Niu Fei a communication jade slip, and now he had no way to contact him.
“I have a way to contact my father.”
Niu Ben said, pulling out a token from his chest, it was identical to the one Niu Li had given Chen Ping!
As Niu Ben dripped a drop of his essence blood onto the token, he quickly established contact with Niu Fei!
Chen Ping wasted no time and immediately explained the situation to Niu Fei!
Niu Fei then led an army of over a hundred thousand, marching grandly towards Flying Tiger City.
“For the time being, the soldiers here probably won’t be redeployed, where can the five of us hide?”
Bai Yi asked Chen Ping!
Chen Ping was unfamiliar with the place, he had no idea where they could hide.
“I know a place, follow me, it’s where human cultivators are imprisoned, if we can free them, our chances of breaking out of the city together might improve.”
Aisha spoke up!
“You just want us to rescue your people, don’t you?” Mad Immortal gave Aisha a sidelong glance, “We’re not fools, that place must be even more heavily guarded.”
“There aren’t many guards, really…”
Aisha said anxiously!
She genuinely wanted Chen Ping and the others to help free her people, but it was also to increase their numbers for a better chance of escaping the city.
“Lead the way…”
Chen Ping instructed Aisha to guide them.
Aisha nodded and began leading Chen Ping and the others through the city.
Aisha was clearly far more familiar with the city’s layout than Chen Ping and his group.
Several times they nearly ran into soldiers, but Aisha cleverly avoided them each time.
Soon, Chen Ping and his group arrived at a massive fortified enclave, it was like a city within a city, with towering stone walls that were blood-red in colour.
“All the human cultivators are imprisoned here,” Aisha pointed at the enclave, “Right now, many of the guards are out searching for us, so there probably aren’t many left here.”
“And they’d never expect us to return to this place instead of fleeing, so we can catch them off guard.”
Aisha explained!
“Alright, we’ll do as you say!” Chen Ping nodded, “Let’s put our armour back on and get inside first.”
Chen Ping and the others donned their armour again, then escorted Aisha towards the enclave.
As they reached the entrance, an old man stopped them.
“This is the heavenly prison, no entry without a military order.”
The old man said coldly!
“We’re here to escort this fugitive, she escaped from the heavenly prison, and we’ve recaptured her.”
Chen Ping stepped forward, pointing at Aisha as he spoke!
When the old man saw Aisha, fury blazed in his eyes.
“Damn it, you made me get chewed out for letting you escape.”
The old man stepped forward and slapped Aisha hard across the face.
The slap left Aisha bleeding from her mouth and nose, but she could only endure it, glaring at the old man in anger.
“Thank you for your hard work, brothers!” the old man said, waving his hand casually!
The massive city gate slowly creaked open.
Chen Ping and the old man escorted Aisha inside!
