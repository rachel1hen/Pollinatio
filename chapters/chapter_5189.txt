The old man felt the destructive force, terrified out of his wits, and desperately tried to dodge with all his strength, only to find himself seemingly locked by an invisible force, unable to move.
He could only watch helplessly as the golden sword light drew closer, finally reflecting in his pupils.
“Pfft!”
With a soft sound, like cutting through tofu, the old man’s head shot into the air, blood gushing from his neck, staining the sky red.
His head, filled with fear and disbelief, tumbled several times in the air before crashing heavily to the ground, completely lifeless.
Hu Mazi climbed out of the deep pit, clutching his chest as he walked to Chen Ping’s side. Looking at the head on the ground and then at the terrified demon cultivators, he couldn’t help but click his tongue, “Kid, you’re a bit too ruthless, aren’t you?”
Chen Ping said calmly, “Being merciful to enemies is being cruel to oneself.
Especially with these arrogant demons who treat human lives like grass, there’s no need to be polite.”
Hu Mazi was speechless; Chen Ping’s aura was getting more and more intense!
Suddenly, the space trembled, and a middle-aged man appeared before Chen Ping and Hu Mazi!
“Humans, you dare to kill my demon kin?”
The middle-aged man’s gaze coldly fixed on Chen Ping and Hu Mazi!
“Here comes another one…”
Chen Ping sighed in exasperation!
“You two ignorant humans, how dare you trespass on demon territory? Are you seeking death?”
The middle-aged man roared angrily!
“Master Hu, you handle this…” Chen Ping looked at Hu Mazi!
Hu Mazi stepped forward to the middle-aged man and said, “This place originally belonged to my Hu clan, inhabited by humans, not your demon kind.”
The middle-aged man stared at Hu Mazi, frowning, “You’re talking nonsense…”
Hu Mazi, hearing this, flew into a rage, “You’re the one talking nonsense…”
As his voice fell, Hu Mazi leapt forward!
The middle-aged man’s expression shifted, and he swung his right hand fiercely!
Boom!
With a loud explosion, Hu Mazi was blasted back, but the middle-aged man also staggered back dozens of steps.
“I didn’t expect a mere human like you to have such strength!”
The middle-aged man’s expression grew serious!
Hu Mazi was nearly furious to death. If he hadn’t been reincarnated multiple times, his strength greatly diminished, he would’ve already taken down this demon!
Seeing Hu Mazi withstand his blow, the middle-aged man’s eyes flashed with surprise, quickly replaced by anger. With a cold snort, demonic energy surged around him, clearly preparing to strike again.
“Mere humans, daring to act wildly in demon territory? If I don’t grind you to dust today, I won’t quell my rage!”
Before his words faded, he raised his hand, a pitch-black demonic flame coalescing in his palm, which he hurled fiercely at Hu Mazi!
Hu Mazi’s expression changed slightly; this attack’s power far surpassed the previous one. With his current strength not yet restored, taking it head-on would likely spell trouble!
Just as the demonic flame was about to hit—
“Stop!!!”
A clear, cold female voice rang out abruptly, followed by a slender figure appearing out of nowhere in front of Hu Mazi. With a light wave of her hand, the demonic flame melted away like snow meeting fire!
The middle-aged man’s face changed drastically. He quickly withdrew his hand, stepped back, and bowed respectfully, “Demoness!”
Chen Ping’s gaze sharpened as he looked at the newcomer.
She was a woman in a long black dress, her skin as fair as snow, her features exquisite, yet her eyes were deep as an abyss, exuding a chilling coldness.
Her aura was restrained, yet it gave an unfathomable feeling.
“Third-grade Earth Immortal?”
Chen Ping was inwardly shocked; this woman’s strength was likely far greater than the old man’s!
The woman glanced faintly at the middle-aged man, her tone icy, “Who permitted you to act on your own…?”
