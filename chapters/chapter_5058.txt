The protective golden light on Tianci’s chest shattered instantly, and he flew backwards like a kite with a broken string, crashing heavily into the stone wall, creating a deep crater!
“What?”
Elder Tong’s pupils contracted, his face full of disbelief.
His hand, which had been casually stroking his beard, froze mid-air, a few strands of his beard snapping off unnoticed.
A third-rank Loose Immortal had repelled a fifth-rank with a single punch?
Tianci crawled out of the rubble, his face ashen, a trickle of blood seeping from the corner of his mouth.
He looked down at the scorched fist mark on his chest, a flash of horror in his eyes.
The white-robed woman was equally shocked. She knew Tianci’s strength; he was a prodigy of Tian Yuan Pavilion, capable of fighting above his level.
Yet now, Tianci, two realms above Chen Ping, had been sent reeling by a single punch?
This was too absurd!
Tianci had used a weapon, while Chen Ping relied solely on his fist.
The gap was clear, and Chen Ping’s choice not to use a weapon seemed like a deliberate humiliation of Tianci.
Seeing Chen Ping defeat Tianci with one punch, Mo Qingyun let out a long sigh of relief, her affection for Chen Ping growing even stronger.
A prodigy like him, powerful and handsome—who wouldn’t fall for such a man?
“Not bad, but… it’s not enough!”
Tianci slowly stood, roaring with fury, feeling utterly humiliated.
He was a prodigy of Tian Yuan Pavilion, admired by all.
Yet today, a fifth-rank Loose Immortal like him had been made to spit blood by Chen Ping, a third-rank, who hadn’t even used a weapon.
Tianci spat out a mouthful of blood, his body erupting in golden light. Behind him, a ten-metre-tall golden phantom appeared—a majestic divine general clad in golden armour, wielding a long halberd, its eyes like lightning, exuding an oppressive aura!
“Dharmakaya?” Elder Tong frowned at the sight.
With the Dharmakaya’s appearance, the entire relic trembled, and Tianci’s aura surged, faintly approaching the sixth-rank Loose Immortal Realm!
“This guy’s gone mad. To use the Dharmakaya so early—it’s harmful to himself,” the white-robed woman shook her head slightly, watching Tianci’s frenzy.
“Die!”
Tianci clapped his hands together, and the golden Dharmakaya mirrored his action. A massive golden palm descended from the sky, blotting out the heavens.
The palm’s lines were clearly visible, with an ancient “Suppress” character condensed at its centre, carrying an overwhelming force that could crush anything, slamming towards Chen Ping!
Tian Yuan Demon-Suppressing Palm!
This was Tianci’s strongest killing move! Before the palm’s force even arrived, the ground began to collapse, the stone tiles beneath Chen Ping’s feet shattering inch by inch.
Chen Ping looked up, a trace of solemnity in his eyes, but he remained calm.
His hands swiftly formed seals, various powers surging wildly within him. A massive black vortex formed around him, faintly revealing swirling stars, as if it could devour all forces!
The golden palm crashed down but was gradually broken down and absorbed the moment it touched the black vortex.
The “Suppress” character trembled violently before shattering into countless specks of light.
Boom!
The palm’s residual force blasted a ten-metre-deep palm-shaped crater into the ground, sending dust billowing into the air.
As the dust settled, Chen Ping still stood tall, though a trickle of blood stained his lips, and his robe was slightly tattered.
“Impossible!”
Tianci was utterly shocked, his face pale as paper. His full-powered strike had been withstood by Chen Ping!
“My turn.”
Chen Ping wiped the blood from his mouth. Suddenly, the Dragon-Slaying Sword appeared in his hand, his spiritual energy erupting like a volcano!
With a swing of the Dragon-Slaying Sword, thousands of sword shadows burst from his body, weaving into a sword net in the air.
Swish, swish, swish!
The thousands of sword shadows instantly converged, forming a hundred-metre-long giant sword. Blood-red dragon patterns coiled around its blade, a chilling glint at its tip like a star, carrying the momentum to cleave the heavens, slashing towards Tianci!
Tianci hurriedly summoned a golden shield to block, but it was cleaved in two with a single strike.
