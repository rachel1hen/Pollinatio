Seeing Chen Ping like this, Lin Kefan and the others wanted to beat him up!
How many men couldn’t even find a dual-cultivation partner, yet this guy Chen Ping actually had dozens?
“Hahaha, truly extraordinary, you’ve got some skills, kid.”
The Northern Domain Lord laughed heartily, then glanced at Elder Qian, “Old thing, this is now my family matter. If you dare lay a hand on my son-in-law again, be careful I don’t kill you…”
“Fine, since you want to wade into this mess, my Divine Temple will accompany you to the end!”
Elder Qian’s eyes narrowed, and the aura within him began to surge!
Without wasting words, the Northern Domain Lord waved his hand, and a beam of white light shot straight towards Elder Qian!
“Bring it on!” Elder Qian instantly transformed into a streak of light, charging at the Northern Domain Lord!
Seeing this, the Northern Domain Lord sneered coldly, tore through space-time, and took Elder Qian far away from the area, “If we’re going to fight, let’s do it on someone else’s turf. Don’t ruin my place!”
Elder Qian hadn’t expected the Northern Domain Lord to pull such a move. By the time he wanted to retreat, it was already too late!
The Northern Domain Lord and Elder Qian had vanished to who-knows-where to battle!
Seeing Elder Qian taken away, the Tenth Hall Master’s face looked as if he had eaten something vile.
Now, the Tenth Hall relied entirely on Elder Qian to hold things together. With him gone, and the rest of the Tenth Hall either dead or injured, the Tenth Hall Master alone was no match for Chen Ping and his group!
Especially with Hua Yueying present—her “Heavenly Rain” technique was ridiculously overpowered!
“Huò Qīng, when will the people you called arrive?”
The Tenth Hall Master asked Huò Qīng.
Now, they could only hope that the people Huò Qīng had summoned would arrive soon!
“I’m not sure. Perhaps they’ve already reached the Tenth Hall, but we left.”
Huò Qīng shook his head.
Hearing this, the Tenth Hall Master glared furiously at Chen Ping. It was all because of this guy’s trickery that they had been lured out of the Tenth Hall!
“Fourth Brother-in-law, finish off the rest of the Tenth Hall quickly. Leave the Tenth Hall Master to me.”
“Miss Hua, use your formations to support me…”
After speaking, Chen Ping’s body transformed into a sword light, charging straight at the Tenth Hall Master!
The Tenth Hall Master gritted his teeth, a fierce glint flashing in his eyes, and he too charged at Chen Ping!
The two clashed head-on!
Boom!
The two collided and then separated!
Chen Ping was forced back several steps, his blood and energy churning. The Tenth Hall Master wasn’t faring much better, retreating with a pale face.
Hua Yueying, however, instantly cast a gentle light that enveloped Chen Ping, soothing him and allowing him to recover quickly.
But the Tenth Hall Master had no one to aid him. Every bit of energy he expended now was a huge challenge.
“Let’s see how long you can last…”
Chen Ping sneered coldly, pointing the Dragon-Slaying Sword at the Tenth Hall Master.
The Tenth Hall Master furrowed his brow, trying to regulate the energy within him.
At that moment, the heavens and earth suddenly changed!
Boom!
A rift tore open in the sky, and over a dozen terrifying auras swept in!
“Hahaha, our reinforcements are here…”
The Tenth Hall Master laughed excitedly.
At the forefront were two figures: an elderly man with a white beard and a middle-aged man in a brocade robe, his long hair flowing, holding a spear with a jet-black tip.
“Steward Lú, Big Brother…”
Huò Qīng shouted at the elderly man.
The old man waved his hand, and a powerful force sent Cang Yue, who had been fighting Huò Qīng, flying backward.
Seeing the newcomers, Chen Ping and the others grew extremely tense.
The auras of this old man and the middle-aged man surpassed even that of the Tenth Hall Master!
Not to mention the dozen or so cultivators behind them.
“Miss Hua, set up a formation to hold them off. Everyone else, follow me and run…”
Chen Ping immediately ordered Hua Yueying to create a formation to delay the newcomers, giving them time to escape!
