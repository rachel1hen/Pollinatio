He truly hadn’t considered these things!
After hearing the woman in white, the Third Elder seemed to grasp something.
“Miss, are you suggesting that Chen Ping has someone backing him, which is why he’s not afraid of Tianyuan Pavilion?” the Third Elder asked.
“A first-rank Loose Immortal Realm cultivator, yet able to enter the Second Heaven ruins and even injure Tianci. And it was this Chen Ping who discovered that the mysterious elder was a fraud. Don’t you think his actions suggest he’s no ordinary person? If we recklessly provoke him and offend someone we shouldn’t, our Shura Hall won’t be far from destruction,” the woman in white said with deep concern.
The Third Elder frowned slightly, “In the Second Heaven, aside from our Shura Hall, who doesn’t fear Tianyuan Pavilion? Even the eight halls of the Divine Temple wouldn’t dare provoke them. What kind of backing could this Chen Ping have?”
“There are heavens beyond heavens, and people beyond people. Forget the entire Celestial Realm, even the Second Heaven is vast enough. There may be forces we’re unaware of,” the woman in white replied.
The Third Elder fell silent, unsure of what to say.
“Third Elder, spread the word: if Tianyuan Pavilion moves against Chen Ping, our Shura Hall can assist him. It might even be an opportunity to build a connection. Under no circumstances should we provoke him or covet those two coffins. We wait and observe,” the woman in white instructed.
“Understood,” the Third Elder nodded.
…
In a void within the Second Heaven!
As the void trembled, Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun’s figures slowly appeared.
“We should be close to the Mo family,” Mo Qingyun said, glancing at the void ahead.
“Good, let’s go,” Chen Ping nodded, leading Mo Qingyun forward.
Since they were close, there was no need for a teleportation array. Using one consumed significant resources and wasn’t to be done lightly.
But as they flew, Chen Ping’s brow furrowed instantly.
“What’s wrong?” Mo Qingyun asked.
Chen Ping didn’t respond. Instead, he slowly raised his hand and gently waved it toward the void ahead.
As his palm moved, the void rippled like water.
“Someone’s targeting us. This void is fake,” Chen Ping said gravely.
“Fake?” Mo Qingyun was startled.
She hadn’t expected someone to create a fake void to deceive them. This meant they were likely far from the Mo family, and who knew where they actually were!
“Come out. What’s the point of sneaking around with a fake void?” Chen Ping said coldly into the void.
“Not bad, you saw through it at a glance,” a voice replied as the void slowly dissipated, revealing the true face of the world.
A young man in a cloud robe appeared with a cold smirk. Behind him followed four figures in black, their bodies entirely wrapped in dark cloth except for their eyes, which showed no trace of color or emotion, like those of the dead.
“Miss Mo, do you know this person?” Chen Ping asked Mo Qingyun.
Mo Qingyun shook her head, “No, the Second Heaven is vast, and I don’t know many people.”
Seeing that Mo Qingyun didn’t recognize the young man, Chen Ping asked, “Who are you? Why did you create a fake void to trick us?”
“I am Sang Kun from Shura Hall,” the young man said coldly.
“Sang Kun?” Chen Ping burst out laughing, “Your name, did your parents have a grudge against you to give you such a name?”
Chen Ping nearly doubled over with laughter, unable to believe someone would have such a name.
“Shut up! It’s Sang Kun, not ‘Sorrowful Kun’!” Sang Kun roared angrily.
