*Clang!*
The Tenth Hall Master raised his arm to block Chen Ping, who was now right in front of him, and a crisp metallic sound rang out.
The Tenth Hall Master’s arm was slashed to the bone!
At that moment, a surge of power struck, sending Chen Ping flying back a hundred feet.
“Do you think the Tenth Hall has no one left?”
Elder Qian’s face was grim as he spoke.
Seeing Elder Qian, Chen Ping frowned. This guy, who could deduce the workings of the heavens, was a real problem.
Elder Qian’s figure flickered slightly, and in an instant, he disappeared, only to reappear right in front of Chen Ping.
Chen Ping’s hair stood on end. This was way too fast!
Before Chen Ping could react, a figure suddenly appeared, blocking Elder Qian.
*Boom!*
With a loud explosion, Elder Qian was forced back.
“North Domain Lord, are you really going to meddle in this?”
Elder Qian asked coldly.
“This is my family matter. How is it meddling?”
The North Domain Lord replied with a faint smile.
“You should know that the Divine Hall’s influence spans the entire universe and the celestial realms. Even in the Heavenly Realm, we have our forces. Are you really going to oppose the Divine Hall?”
“Once you ascend to the Heavenly Realm, you’ll be nothing but an ant in front of us. We can crush you however we please!”
Elder Qian threatened the North Domain Lord.
“Whether I can ascend to the Heavenly Realm is still uncertain. Even if I do, with my son-in-law backing me, what do I have to fear?”
The North Domain Lord glanced at Chen Ping, a look of pride on his face.
Chen Ping was speechless. What was this all about? Since when was he the son-in-law? He had only held Hua Yueying earlier to ensure her safety. How did this turn into a relationship?
Hua Yueying’s face also turned red with embarrassment. She quickly explained, “Mr. Chen and I are just in a cooperative relationship. He provides the resources, and I provide the effort. That’s all…”
“If it’s just a business relationship, then I won’t get involved in this mess. The Divine Hall isn’t to be trifled with. I’ll take you away now.”
“Whatever resources you need, just tell me. I’ll provide them for you.”
With that, the North Domain Lord grabbed Hua Yueying’s hand, ready to leave.
“Damn it…”
Chen Ping was speechless. Wasn’t this coercion?
Hua Yueying was also stunned and quickly broke free from the North Domain Lord’s grip. “I… I…”
“Senior, although we are in a business relationship, I did hold Miss Hua earlier, which could be considered intimate contact.”
“If Miss Hua doesn’t mind and is willing to stay with me, I have no objections…”
Chen Ping couldn’t let the North Domain Lord leave. After all, he already had many women. One more wouldn’t make much of a difference.
“Brother-in-law, what are you saying? What about my sister?”
“You two were matched by the Supreme Daoist himself, and both sides agreed. You can’t just abandon the old for the new!”
Lin Kefan was furious and stepped forward angrily.
“Fourth Brother-in-law, I already have many girlfriends, and some of them have even become my wives. Ting’er knows about all of this, and she doesn’t mind.”
Chen Ping quickly explained to Lin Kefan.
“You have many women?” Lin Kefan looked at Chen Ping, his eyes filled with envy.
“It’s normal for a great man to have three wives and four concubines. With his status and background, even a few more wouldn’t matter.”
“How many women do you have now, including my daughter?”
The North Domain Lord asked.
Chen Ping fell into thought, counting on his fingers.
Lin Kefan, the North Domain Lord, and the others were stunned.
“Brother-in-law, what are you doing? How many women do you actually have?”
Lin Kefan asked in shock.
“More than ten? Maybe over twenty? I’ve lost count myself…”
Chen Ping replied awkwardly.
Some women he had only slept with once before parting ways, and Chen Ping didn’t even remember them clearly.
Like the Ji sisters, Ji Meiyan and Ji Meiling, Chen Ping had slept with them too, but it was only for the sake of obtaining his bloodline.
Whether they counted as his women, Chen Ping wasn’t sure either!
