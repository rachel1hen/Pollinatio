Chen Ping seized the opportunity, breaking through the encirclement of the ghost formation, charging towards You Wuxie.
Seeing this, You Wuxie, far from being alarmed, was delighted: “Well done!”
His figure flickered, merging with the nine soul banners, transforming into a massive black shadow, lunging at Chen Ping.
The two clashed instantly, golden sword qi intertwining with black ghostly shadows, each collision unleashing earth-shattering power.
Dark clouds churned in the sky, lightning flashing and thunder roaring, as if the entire world trembled for this great battle.
The Seventh Hall Master, Huo Jingjing, Mo Qingyun, Hu Mazi, and others hid inside the hall, watching the earth-shaking battle outside through the windows, their faces filled with tension and worry.
“Can Chen Ping… can he win?” Huo Jingjing murmured, her hands tightly clenched.
The Seventh Hall Master sighed: “You Wuxie is, after all, an Earth Immortal realm cultivator, his strength unfathomably deep.”
“For Chen Ping to hold on this long is already a miracle, let’s hope he can create an even greater one.”
Hu Mazi, eyes wide with excitement, exclaimed: “What a lad, full of grit! This is the kind of fight a man should have!”
On the battlefield, Chen Ping and You Wuxie had fought for three hundred rounds.
Both bore injuries, their breaths growing unsteady, yet neither had gained the upper hand.
Relying on exquisite swordsmanship and powerful divine soul strength, Chen Ping repeatedly countered You Wuxie’s attacks, even seizing chances to strike back, causing trouble for his opponent.
You Wuxie, with his Earth Immortal realm cultivation and eerie Netherworld Great Law, relentlessly suppressed Chen Ping, holding the initiative on the field.
“Boy, your strength has exceeded my expectations,” You Wuxie panted, a trace of solemnity in his eyes, “but you’re merely at the Loose Immortal realm, you can’t possibly be my match.”
“This is my final move, survive it, you live; fail, you die!”
“Netherworld Absolute Kill, Ten Thousand Souls as One!”
You Wuxie fused all nine soul banners into his body, an overwhelming pressure radiating from him, a terrifying force gathering within, his body gradually turning transparent, forming a massive soul orb.
“Not good!”
Chen Ping’s heart tightened, sensing the soul orb contained cataclysmic power, its eruption unimaginable.
“Slay Heaven, Destroy Earth!”
Chen Ping unleashed his ultimate move, learned from the Sword Sect, as the Dragon-Slaying Sword erupted with dazzling light, golden sword qi forming a massive sword shadow hovering above his head.
“Go!”
You Wuxie roared, the massive soul orb hurtling towards Chen Ping with world-destroying momentum.
“Slash!”
Chen Ping swung the Dragon-Slaying Sword, the enormous golden sword shadow cleaving towards the soul orb like the opening of heaven and earth.
The golden sword shadow collided with the soul orb, time seeming to freeze in that moment.
The next second, an indescribable, terrifying force erupted, the entire Black Wind Abyss trembling, the sky torn open with a massive rift, revealing the starry void beyond.
The Seventh Hall teetered under this force, nearly collapsing.
Chen Ping was blasted backwards, crashing heavily into the hall’s wall, spitting out a mouthful of blood, his breath faint.
You Wuxie was also shattered, the massive soul orb disintegrating instantly, turning into a wisp of black smoke fleeing into the distance.
“Chen Ping, I, You Wuxie, will remember this grudge! One day, I’ll return and reduce you and this Seventh Hall to ashes!” You Wuxie’s voice echoed from afar, filled with boundless resentment and unwillingness.
Chen Ping watched the direction of You Wuxie’s escape, wanting to pursue, but found himself exhausted, his vision darkening as he fainted.
“Mr. Chen!”
“Chen Ping!”
Huo Jingjing, Mo Qingyun, Yun Wuya, and Hu Mazi rushed out, lifting Chen Ping up.
