At this moment, the battle in Wuwang Land raged on, with both sides seemingly consumed by bloodlust!
As Chen Ping recovered, several hostile gazes locked onto him with ill intent, like predators silently stalking their prey from the shadows!
Chen Ping knew these people were all eyeing his Divine King Bow!
The moment his side showed any sign of weakness, a swarm of them would immediately rush towards him!
“Chen Ping, are you alright?”
Yun Li appeared, emerging from the Heaven-Ascending Ladder. Seeing Chen Ping frantically restoring his strength, he asked with a hint of panic!
“I won’t die. How did it go for you inside the Heaven-Ascending Ladder?” Chen Ping inquired.
“Ugh, don’t even mention it. The world inside the ladder has changed. The Immortal Venerable Mansion is gone. I held out on the fourth level until now, but there was no way to clear it, so I came out,” Yun Li sighed.
“Brother Yun Li, please stand guard for me. I need to recover quickly. There are plenty of people around here watching me like hawks!” Chen Ping asked Yun Li to protect him.
Otherwise, if someone ambushed him while he was recovering, it’d be trouble!
“Alright!” Yun Li nodded.
As Chen Ping continued his recovery, Lin Kefan, Xuan Bin, and others from Sun-Moon City arrived!
They had been fighting the Lian San Sect and the Huo Family, initially holding the upper hand!
But the intervention of the Eight Swordsmen of Demon Mountain instantly put Sun-Moon City under immense pressure!
In this battle, Sun-Moon City lost five Immortal Transformation Realm cultivators, and even Cang Yue fell to the enemy’s blade!
However, the Lian San Sect and the Huo Family didn’t fare much better, losing a fair number of their own experts as well!
Chen Ping looked at Lin Kefan and the others, nearly all of them injured, their eyes burning with rage!
The Four Nether Prefectures, the Lian San Sect, the Huo Family…
He vowed to make these forces vanish from the Celestial Realm forever!
At Chen Ping’s chest, the Dragon Crystal began to emit a blinding light as the Heart-Calming Technique reached a frenzied peak!
All the absorbable energy in Wuwang Land surged towards Chen Ping’s body!
Even the ever-steady Heaven-Ascending Ladder trembled slightly at that moment!
Chen Ping’s eyes turned blood-red!
“Ahh…”
With a furious roar, the sky above Wuwang Land was instantly blanketed by dark clouds!
Seeing this terrifying scene, everyone halted their fighting!
“What is this? Thunder tribulation clouds? Is Mr. Chen about to break through again?” Li Chunfeng stared in astonishment at the sky shrouded in darkness, finding it unbelievable!
After all, Chen Ping had only recently broken through. If he were to advance again now, it would be utterly absurd!
Yun Li, Lin Kefan, and the others also gazed at Chen Ping in shock!
At this moment, Chen Ping looked like a man possessed, his blood-red eyes radiating a murderous, bloodthirsty aura, as if he intended to slaughter the entire Celestial Realm!
Ming Shao frowned slightly as he observed the suddenly darkened heavens!
“Ming Shao, is Chen Ping about to break through?” Huo Zhenfeng asked in shock, feeling the overwhelming presence of the thunder tribulation clouds!
“Such terrifying thunder tribulation clouds! This isn’t something a Great Ascension Realm cultivator’s breakthrough could trigger!” Qian Xiaohan was equally stunned!
Ming Shao didn’t respond. Instead, he glanced at Qian Xiaohan and Huo Zhenfeng. “Do you two still have the strength to fight?”
The two exchanged a look, their expressions tinged with awkwardness. In their battle against Sun-Moon City, they had lost many experts. If not for the Eight Swordsmen of Demon Mountain joining in, their losses might have been even greater!
After such an intense fight, they were all in a weakened state. Facing the terrifying battle before them now, if they joined in, they’d likely fall within a few rounds!
“Ming Shao, though I can’t fight anymore, I’m willing to summon the Huo Family’s ancestor and give my all for you!” Huo Zhenfeng declared.
Ming Shao nodded in satisfaction and, with a casual wave of his hand, a large sack of immortal spirit stones appeared before Huo Zhenfeng.
“Here are 500,000 immortal spirit stones. Those who pledge loyalty to my Four Nether Prefectures will never lack resources!” Ming Shao boasted arrogantly.
Huo Zhenfeng’s hands trembled as he accepted the storage pouch, his heart racing with excitement. With these 500,000 immortal spirit stones, the Huo Family could cultivate many more Immortal Transformation Realm experts!
