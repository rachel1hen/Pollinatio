“I don’t care what kind of ‘Kun’ you are, why are you blocking our way?” Chen Ping asked Sang Kun.
“You’re Chen Ping, right?” Sang Kun sneered coldly.
“You know me?” Chen Ping looked surprised, “I don’t think we’ve met.”
“Whether we’ve met doesn’t matter. Just hand over the two coffins you got from the ruins,” Sang Kun said.
Chen Ping realized this guy was after the coffins.
“Who do you think you are? You expect me to just hand them over?” Chen Ping sneered.
“You’re not giving me face? Ask around, who doesn’t know Sang Kun of Shura Hall? If you don’t hand them over, I won’t be polite,” Sang Kun said, his eyes narrowing, exuding a murderous aura.
“If I kill this guy, will Shura Hall cause trouble for your Mo family?” Chen Ping asked Mo Qingyun.
Mo Qingyun was taken aback, then shook her head, “I don’t know…”
“Since you don’t know, stay back. If he dies, it’ll have nothing to do with your Mo family,” Chen Ping said.
“Hahaha…” Sang Kun laughed loudly, “Kid, you want to kill me? Look at yourself, a mere third-rank Loose Immortal Realm cultivator, and you dare have murderous thoughts toward me? Even if I stood still and let you strike my neck, could you kill me?”
Sang Kun’s face was full of disdain as he stretched his neck toward Chen Ping.
“I’ve lived this long and never seen such a request. Since you insist, I’ll oblige,” Chen Ping said.
Suddenly, the Dragon-Slaying Sword appeared in his hand, and with a swift swing, a flash of sword light passed.
Sang Kun’s head was instantly severed, without the slightest hesitation.
“Young Master…” the four black-clad figures gasped in shock.
They never expected Chen Ping would actually dare to act, killing Sang Kun outright.
“You all heard him, your young master asked me to kill him. I was just fulfilling his wish. As for my help, I won’t charge you a fee,” Chen Ping said, pulling Mo Qingyun to leave.
But the four black-clad figures blocked their path.
The leader among them said, “You killed our young master and think you can just walk away?”
“What? You want to join him?” Chen Ping gave a faint smile, unleashing a terrifying aura.
The aura made the four black-clad figures tremble.
Feeling Chen Ping’s presence, none of them dared to make a move, uncertain if they could match him.
Seeing their hesitation, Chen Ping took Mo Qingyun and left.
“Big Brother, the young master was killed, and we’re just letting them go?” one of the black-clad figures asked, dissatisfied.
“Yeah, how will we explain this to the Hall Master?” another added.
“Shut up, what do you know?” the leader frowned, “This Chen Ping is no ordinary person. The four of us might not even be his match. We get so few resources in Shura Hall each year, why risk our lives? We’ll report this to the Young Miss, and it’ll have nothing to do with us. From now on, remember: report everything upward, and it’s got nothing to do with us.”
With that, the leader’s figure slowly vanished.
Meanwhile, Chen Ping was leading Mo Qingyun toward the Mo family.
Mo Qingyun, puzzled, asked, “Chen Ping, why did you dare to kill someone from Shura Hall?”
“Why wouldn’t I?” Chen Ping smiled faintly, “I don’t take Shura Hall seriously at all. He tried to steal my things, so of course I’d kill him, especially since he asked for it. If I didn’t fulfill such a request, I’d be too inconsiderate!”
