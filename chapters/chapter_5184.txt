Seeing Chen Ping’s pale face and the blood at the corner of his mouth, everyone felt a surge of worry.
“Quick, carry Chen Ping to the stone chamber for healing!” the Seventh Hall Master urged.
Having just finished healing and advanced his realm, he was already so gravely injured!
They feared his body couldn’t withstand it and would collapse.
The group hurriedly carried Chen Ping to the stone chamber, where the Seventh Hall Master took out a translucent pill, carefully feeding it to him.
The pill melted in his mouth, a gentle medicinal power slowly spreading through his body, gradually restoring some colour to his face.
“He’s okay, Chen Ping’s fine,” Huo Jingjing said, tears of joy in her eyes, tightly holding his hand.
Mo Qingyun breathed a sigh of relief, a hint of gratitude flashing in her eyes.
Hu Mazi patted his chest: “Scared me to death, thought the lad was done for.”
“But, gotta say, this kid’s a beast, fighting an Earth Immortal to a draw and even driving him off, a proper monster.”
The Seventh Hall Master sighed: “Though You Wuxie fled, he won’t let this go. Our Seventh Hall has now made a mortal enemy of the Evil Path Hall, the days ahead won’t be peaceful.”
“Afraid of what?” Hu Mazi said carelessly. “With Chen Ping here, what’s there to fear from the Evil Path Hall? Once the kid’s healed, we’ll storm their hall and wipe them out!”
The Seventh Hall Master gave a wry smile, saying nothing.
He knew the Evil Path Hall’s deep foundations were not so easily dealt with.
Though You Wuxie lost this time, the Evil Path Hall surely had stronger experts.
In the stone chamber, everyone quietly stood by Chen Ping, waiting for him to wake.
Outside, the sky gradually cleared, sunlight filtering through the clouds, illuminating the scarred plaza and the hope in everyone’s hearts.
Three days later, in the stone chamber.
Chen Ping’s fingers twitched, his eyelids slowly lifting, a trace of confusion in his eyes quickly replaced by clarity.
He propped himself up, feeling a lingering sting in his meridians, but the tearing sensation of near collapse had mostly faded. The spiritual energy in his dantian, though not abundant, was more refined than before the battle.
That deadly fight had gravely injured him, but under extreme pressure, his understanding of sword intent had deepened.
“You’re awake?” Huo Jingjing, who had been by his bedside, stood up abruptly, her eyes reddening, voice choking: “How do you feel? Any lingering pain?”
Chen Ping raised a hand to her shoulder, his fingers brushing her cool hand, and said softly: “I’m fine, Jingjing.”
Mo Qingyun entered from the doorway, carrying a bowl of spiritual porridge. Her gaze fell on his face, seeing his colour stabilised, and she said slowly: “The Seventh Hall Master says you’ve turned misfortune into fortune. Your body, tempered by the pill and sword intent, is stronger than before.”
Hu Mazi, chewing a blade of grass, squatted in the corner, chuckling: “Tough kid! You Wuxie’s just a fleeing soul now, probably too scared to stay in the Third Heaven, likely gone to the Fourth.”
Chen Ping took the porridge, sipping it slowly, the warm spiritual energy sliding down his throat, warming his limbs.
He set the bowl down, his gaze darkening: “Wherever he flees, I’ll chase him.”
“Chen Ping!” Huo Jingjing said urgently. “You’ve just recovered. The Fourth Heaven is a hundred times more dangerous than the Third. Even if You Wuxie’s just a soul, he might find a way to recover there. You…”
“I know,” Chen Ping interrupted, his tone resolute. “If You Wuxie doesn’t die, my injuries were for nothing.”
The Seventh Hall Master entered, sighing: “The Fourth Heaven isn’t so easily reached. Countless peak Loose Immortal realm cultivators failed to pass the thunder tribulation and were reduced to ashes, never making it there!”
“You’re only at Loose Immortal Sixth Rank, likely unable to trigger the tribulation to reach the Fourth Heaven!”
