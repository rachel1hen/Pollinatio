It’s unclear how much time passed, the Tenth Hall Master slowly stood up, the stench of excrement making him gag!
Finally coming to his senses, he realised the few remaining figures in the Tenth Hall, now lay silent!
Already gravely wounded, they couldn’t withstand the pressure of that earlier aura!
Among them, his son, the one fond of lollipops!
But now, staring at his dead son, the Tenth Hall Master’s face showed no flicker of emotion!
“Storage pouch, storage pouch…”
As if struck by a thought, the Tenth Hall Master began rummaging through the bodies for their storage pouches!
Even his son’s pouch wasn’t spared!
In a nearby corner, another pouch lay quietly, he recognised it at a glance, it was the Ninth Hall Master’s, marked with his emblem!
Though the Ninth Hall Master was gone, his pouch remained!
The Tenth Hall Master gathered all the pouches, adding his own to the pile!
“With all these resources, wonder if I could tag along with that Chen Ping…”
The Tenth Hall Master muttered, eyeing the stash!
He now fancied being Chen Ping’s lackey!
With a backer like that, ruling the Celestial Human Realm would be a breeze!
Regret gnawed at him, how had he crossed Chen Ping?!
He wondered if sucking up to Chen Ping now, would still work!
…
Xiao Dynasty!
Chen Ping trained under Hua Yueying, learning the Rain of Grace, an auxiliary array that, for him, wasn’t tough to pick up!
After just one day, he could cast it, though the power was still weak, a testament to his exceptional talent!
“Mr. Chen, you’re a quick learner, your talent’s top-notch!”
Hua Yueying said gleefully!
“To learn well, sleep with the master, or rather, it’s the master’s fine teaching!”
Chen Ping grinned, “No more ‘Mr. Chen’ from now on, my women just call me by name!”
“No!” Hua Yueying shook her head, “Though I’m your woman now, it’s just a deal, not true dual cultivation partners yet, I’ll stick with ‘Mr. Chen’.”
“When I truly fall for you, I’ll switch on my own…”
“Up to you!” Chen Ping didn’t mind!
Boom boom boom…
Just then, at a hidden spot in the Xiao Dynasty, dark clouds rolled in, lightning flashed!
Heaven and earth seemed to merge, chaos reigning!
“Someone’s breaking through?” Hua Yueying said, stunned!
“With a thunder tribulation this fierce, it’s not just one person…”
Chen Ping gazed at the distant sky, speaking slowly!
After who knows how long, the Xiao Dynasty’s skies cleared!
Three terrifying auras, instantly swept across the entire dynasty!
“Immortal Transformation Realm?” Hua Yueying frowned, her face darkening!
“No need to worry, these three blokes broke through together!”
Chen Ping reassured her!
Whoosh whoosh whoosh…
Three figures appeared before Chen Ping and Hua Yueying!
It was Xuan Bin, Zhou Tang, and Cang Yue!
Using the immortal spirit stones Chen Ping gave them, they’d all hit Immortal Transformation Realm together!
A rare marvel in the Celestial Human Realm, three breaking through at once, unheard of!
“Mr. Chen, thank you so much, without you, who knows when we’d have reached this realm!”
Xuan Bin, buzzing with excitement, nearly knelt!
Chen Ping waved him up, “You broke through on your own merit, no need to thank me…”
“Stick with me, and I’ll make sure you’re living large, with endless resources!”
“We’ll follow you to the death, Mr. Chen!” the trio pledged!
“Mr. Chen, trouble, the Tenth Hall Master’s back…” Xiao Yuanshan rushed in, breathless!
