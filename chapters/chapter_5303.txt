Wang Shengguang was stunned; Hu Mazi and Mo Chen, who had just woken up, were also stunned.
The Sword Saint City Lord Li Chunfeng, at the peak of the ninth grade of the Earth Immortal Realm, actually called Chen Ping, who was at the ninth grade of the Loose Immortal Realm, his master?
Wang Shengguang came back to his senses; a ferocious expression appeared on his face: “Li Chunfeng, do not think I am afraid of you! This is the Holy Light Sect, not a place for you to run wild! Even if you are the lord of Sword Saint City, do not think…”
His words were not finished when Li Chunfeng moved.
No one saw clearly how he drew his sword; they only saw a silver stream of light flash by.
The next second, Wang Shengguang maintained his ferocious expression and froze in place.
A thin line of blood appeared on his neck; then his entire body, along with that golden armour, turned into specks of light filling the sky and completely dissipated into the air.
The sect master of the Holy Light Sect, at the ninth grade of the Earth Immortal Realm, was just… instantly killed like that?
The square fell into dead silence; all the disciples of the Holy Light Sect were scared pale, and many collapsed limply to the ground, without even the courage to flee.
Li Chunfeng sheathed his long sword, walked to Chen Ping, and bowed slightly; his tone was respectful: “Mr. Chen, I have frightened you.”
Chen Ping then recovered from his shock; he looked at Li Chunfeng in front of him, opened his mouth, and finally squeezed out a sentence: “You… you are the lord of Sword Saint City?”
Li Chunfeng smiled faintly and nodded: “Indeed, I am the lord of Sword Saint City.”
“Who is that person in charge of Sword Saint City???” Chen Ping’s face was full of curiosity.
“That is one of my servants by my side. Ever since I disappeared, he has been responsible for Sword Saint City, so he is just the person in charge but never dares to call himself the city lord.”
“Mr. Chen, ever since you rescued me from the Heaven-Ascending Ladder, after I returned to the Fifth Heaven, I have been cultivating in seclusion and never left Sword Saint City, nor showed my face.”
“It was not until this time that I accidentally heard your name that I learned you had actually come to the Fifth Heaven. I did not expect that in such a short time, your strength would grow so rapidly.”
“It is my responsibility that Mr. Chen encountered danger; I failed to protect Mr. Chen…”
Li Chunfeng was full of self-blame, after all, he had promised Chen Ping back then to serve Chen Ping for three hundred years.
“I am fine now; you do not need to blame yourself.” Chen Ping smiled faintly: “Nan Batian is also in the Fifth Heaven…”
“I know; he is currently with his childhood sweetheart!”
Li Chunfeng said!
Hu Mazi and Mo Chen listened to the conversation between Li Chunfeng and Chen Ping; both of them were utterly shocked!
Especially Mo Chen; as the former sect master of the Sword Sect, he had even taken Chen Ping as his disciple!
But now, the lord of Sword Saint City was actually Chen Ping’s subordinate.
This scene left Mo Chen somewhat dazed; he simply could not understand it!
“Senior Li…”
Mo Chen stepped forward and bowed to Li Chunfeng!
After all, Mo Chen’s Sword Sect was surviving under the protection of Sword Saint City.
Moreover, in the Fifth Heaven, Li Chunfeng’s swordsmanship had reached the pinnacle; no one could match it. Otherwise, how could he be the lord of Sword Saint City?
“Who are you?” Li Chunfeng did not recognise Mo Chen!
“This is my master, the sect master of the Sword Sect, Mo Chen!” Chen Ping introduced.
Upon hearing this, Li Chunfeng hurriedly returned the courtesy: “So it is Fellow Daoist Mo…”
“Chen Ping, you must not call me your master anymore; I truly cannot bear it.”
“With Senior Li here, what am I? If Senior Li teaches you sword techniques, they would be much stronger than mine!”
Mo Chen said with a face full of embarrassment!
“If Mr. Chen wants to learn, I shall naturally hold nothing back…” Li Chunfeng said!
“We can talk about that later; let us first deal with the matter at hand!” Chen Ping said!
Li Chunfeng nodded, glanced at the trembling disciples of the Holy Light Sect around them; a trace of coldness flashed in his eyes: “These people, keeping them alive is also a scourge.”
Chen Ping said nothing, but that calm look in his eyes indicated his stance.
