Sixth Floor!
As soon as Chen Ping and his group stepped onto the sixth floor, they felt as though their entire bodies had become weightless, unable to stand steady at all!
Before them stood a woman dressed in a sky-blue silk gown, its hem embroidered with silver-threaded lotus patterns that seemed to ripple like water as she walked, each step blooming with grace.
Around her waist was a lotus-pink silk sash, from which hung a creamy white jade pendant that swayed lightly with her movements, chiming like a spring.
She wore an outer layer of crimson gauze, thin as cicada wings, revealing the subtle patterns of her snow-white inner robe. The cuffs were edged with gold thread and adorned with tiny pearls that shimmered softly in the sunlight.
Her raven-black hair cascaded like a waterfall, styled into an elegant updo, with a golden phoenix hairpin clutching a pearl. As she tilted her head slightly, the eastern pearl dangling from the phoenix’s beak swayed, its lustre enhancing her picturesque features and radiant gaze.
Her skin was fairer than snow, her lips like a dab of vermilion, her eyes gently upturned at the corners, their depths holding an autumnal pool of clarity and charm. A pair of emerald teardrop earrings added a touch of liveliness.
In her hand, she held a gilded peony fan, its surface partially concealing her jade-like face, leaving only her expressive eyes visible. With a half-smile, she could already ensnare one’s soul.
“Young Master Chen, I’ve been waiting for you for quite some time…”
The woman spoke, her voice as pleasant as a soft bell, laced with a magnetic charm that left Chen Ping and Ning Zhi staring, entranced!
“Are you the guardian of this floor?”
Chen Ping was somewhat surprised, puzzled as to why the sixth floor’s guardian was a woman!
“Indeed, I’ve been here for a thousand years, lonely for a thousand years, and finally, a man has arrived!”
“I wonder if Young Master Chen might be interested in keeping me company for a little fun?”
Her every glance and gesture was utterly captivating!
“I’d like to know, why were you imprisoned here?” Chen Ping asked curiously!
Others were locked up for peeping at girls bathing or groping them, but this sixth-floor guardian was a woman, and Chen Ping was eager to know what she’d done to end up here!
The woman smiled, “The past is the past, no need to mention it, no need to mention it…”
The more she dodged, the more curious Chen Ping became, “Why can’t you tell me?”
She sighed softly, “Who in their lifetime hasn’t made a mistake? If you err, you correct it, after all, no one’s perfect, not even the immortals.”
“I’m someone who values loyalty and affection deeply, so I did some things that went too far…”
At this, she shook her head, “Better not to speak of it!”
“Senior, you didn’t happen to grope some girl’s backside and get locked up here by her Golden Immortal father, did you?” Chen Ping asked!
If this woman were a lesbian, it might make sense!
“No such thing, I just couldn’t hold back one time and touched a Golden Immortal’s backside, and that’s why I’m imprisoned here!”
She admitted shyly!
“Bloody hell…”
Chen Ping was speechless!
Even Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi were dumbfounded, unable to fathom such a brazen woman!
“Young Master Chen, I’m willing to offer myself, to serve you as a maid by your side, could you save me from this misery?”
She gazed at Chen Ping with tender affection!
“I…” Chen Ping looked at her stunning beauty and that pitiful expression, and he truly wavered!
This woman was just too enticing!
“Yu Ji, you’ve already been freed from your imprisonment seal, yet you still dare to seduce others, do you want to be trapped in this Heavenly Ladder forever?”
Just as Chen Ping was nearly swayed, a booming voice rang out!
“I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare…”
Yu Ji quickly waved her hands, and the staircase to the seventh floor appeared, “Young Master Chen, you may ascend now, I was only joking with you earlier, don’t take it seriously!”
Chen Ping glanced at Yu Ji, realising she must have been trying to gain something from him, only to be seen through!
With Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi in tow, Chen Ping strode confidently up to the seventh floor!
