Chen Ping said this while taking out a crumpled yellow talisman from his bosom. The runes on it were crooked and twisted, clearly the work of a beginner. “Look, just this crappy thing. I thought it would not work.”
Ziyan’s gaze swept over the talisman paper, her fingertip subconsciously condensing a strand of spiritual energy. It was indeed the lowest tier trapping god talisman, with chaotic spiritual energy fluctuations. Let alone trapping the divine clan princess, it might not even hinder a first-grade Earth Immortal realm cultivator for a moment.
But she clearly remembered that at the city gate, when Chen Ping restrained the princess, that golden spiritual energy was condensed as if solid, absolutely incomparable to this waste talisman.
“Fellow Daoist has good luck.”
Ziyan suppressed the doubts in her heart, then pointed to a team of divine guards passing at the end of the street. “Those ahead are the divine guards responsible for patrolling the west city district. Recently, the Divine Capital is not peaceful, there are always some unidentified cultivators wandering nearby. Fellow Daoist, perhaps you should avoid those remote alleys.”
She deliberately mentioned unidentified cultivators, wanting to see if Chen Ping would react to the matter of the divine guards sealing the city gate.
Chen Ping, however, only squinted his eyes at those divine guards’ silver armour, clicking his tongue in admiration. “This armour is really shiny, much more imposing than those soldier fellows I saw in the Fifth Heaven!
If I could have one, no one would dare bully me when I go out running errands.”
As he spoke, he even reached out to touch the divine guard’s armour, only sheepishly retracting his hand after being coldly glared at by the divine guard, completely ignoring the mention of unidentified cultivators.
Ziyan looked at his completely indifferent appearance. Not only did the doubts in her heart not dissipate, they grew heavier.
She did not believe that a cultivator who could trap the princess would be so crude and ignorant, but Chen Ping’s words and actions showed no flaws. Whether it was his awe of the Divine Kingdom, his greed for treasures, or his evasion of key issues, all resembled a true bottom-tier loose cultivator.
“Ahead is the Moon Gazing Pavilion, one of the few pavilions in the Divine Capital that allows outsiders to enter. Fellow Daoist, would you like to go up and sit?”
Ziyan suddenly changed direction, leading Chen Ping towards a pavilion carved with cloud patterns. “From upstairs, you can see most of the Divine Capital’s scenery. Since Fellow Daoist came to broaden your horizons, it is perfect to go up and have a look.”
She calculated to change the environment for probing. Perhaps when seeing the imperial palace or the sealed land from high up, Chen Ping would reveal a flaw.
Chen Ping’s eyes immediately lit up, and he quickly followed. “Great, great! I have never stood on a high building to view the scenery!”
He took three steps in two, walking up the pavilion stairs, completely unaware of Ziyan’s gaze falling on his back, carrying a cold intent.
She had already decided that regardless of whether Chen Ping was a true loose cultivator or not, she must send people to watch him. A person who could trap the divine clan princess at the first grade of the Earth Immortal realm absolutely could not be left unchecked.
Just as they went up to the second floor of the pavilion, they heard two divine clan cultivators at the neighbouring table conversing in low voices. One of them mentioned that the seal at Leiyin Mountain had fluctuated again, and the other quickly covered his mouth, vigilantly scanning the surroundings.
Chen Ping picked up the tea on the table, pretending to drink, but his ears quietly perked up.
And Ziyan sat opposite him, taking in his small actions completely, the corner of her mouth curling into an imperceptible arc. She wanted to see how long this feigning fool Chen Ping could pretend.
At this moment, bursts of clear morning reading sounds attracted Chen Ping. Chen Ping followed the sound and saw that not far from the Moon Gazing Pavilion, there was actually an academy!
Chen Ping looked towards the students in the academy. He saw them dressed in splendid clothes, with rosy complexions, their every gesture carrying the innate nobility of the divine clan. But that vigour, in Chen Ping’s eyes, revealed a pedantic air.
Seeing Chen Ping’s gaze towards those students, Ziyan at this moment said with a face full of arrogance. “This is our Divine Kingdom’s most noble academy. Those studying here are all geniuses.”
“Our divine clan cultivators not only blindly cultivate, but also learn knowledge, cultivate sentiments, and refine our inner spirit.”
“If there is no inner spirit, and one only knows blind cultivation, then one becomes a barbarian!”
