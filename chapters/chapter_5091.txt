Meanwhile, Chen Ping was still fighting the Great Elder!
Mo Qingyun stood in the distance, her face as pale as paper.
She could feel that if the fight continued like this, the entire Liuli City would likely be reduced to dust.
At that moment, a stern and aged shout came from afar, “Enough! All of you, stop!”
A streak of purple-gold light shot through the sky, landing instantly at the centre of the energy vortex.
It was an old man in a dark purple robe adorned with dragon patterns, his face weathered, his eyes as deep as the starry sky, exuding a terrifying aura that made the heavens and earth submit. This was Sang Tianyang, the Master of Shura Hall.
With a single move, he pointed his fingers like a sword, and with a gentle tap, the energy vortex, capable of destroying heaven and earth, melted like ice and snow. The golden dragon and the Shura phantom dissipated in the air simultaneously.
The Great Elder, upon seeing the Hall Master, flashed a trace of reluctance in his eyes but still sheathed his blade resentfully and knelt on one knee, “Hall Master!”
Sang Tianyang didn’t even glance at him. His gaze fell on Chen Ping, his expression complex, “Young friend Chen, though my son Sang Qi deserved his fate, the Great Elder is a pillar of our Shura Hall. By injuring him so severely, haven’t you gone too far?”
His voice was not loud, yet it carried an unquestionable authority, as if the very air had frozen.
Chen Ping gave a faint smile, wiping the blood from his sword, “Hall Master, you jest. It was he who blocked my path seeking revenge. I merely acted in self-defence. If I had died under his blade today, would Shura Hall call that ‘going too far’?”
Sang Tianyang’s brows furrowed, his oppressive aura enveloping Chen Ping!
Yet Chen Ping stood calmly, feeling Sang Tianyang’s pressure without the slightest change in expression!
A moment later, Sang Tianyang withdrew his aura and smiled, “Young friend Chen, it was our Shura Hall’s fault. For my sake, let’s call this matter settled. Upon returning to Shura Hall, I will severely punish the Great Elder!”
Chen Ping was somewhat surprised. He hadn’t expected the Master of Shura Hall to be so reasonable and accommodating!
After all, he had killed two of their sons, yet the Hall Master not only wasn’t angry but even apologised to him.
“Hall Master, you’re too polite. If Shura Hall leaves me be, I won’t pursue this matter further!”
Chen Ping had no desire to make an enemy of Shura Hall!
“Very well. If you have time, young friend Chen, please visit our Shura Hall as a guest!” Sang Tianyang said with a slight smile.
“Definitely!” Chen Ping nodded!
But just as Chen Ping was about to leave with Mo Qingyun, the Great Elder suddenly blocked their path!
“Hall Master, we cannot let this brat leave. He killed the Young Master, and we must avenge him.”
The Great Elder roared!
“Great Elder, I order you to step aside,” Sang Tianyang’s face darkened!
“Hall Master, I must avenge the Young Master today, no matter what.”
The Great Elder defied the Hall Master’s orders!
“Great Elder, you’ve gone too far, ignoring even my father’s words. You may be the Great Elder, but my father is the Hall Master.”
Sang Lan, furious, confronted the Great Elder.
“I only know that if we let him go, how will Shura Hall maintain its standing in the Second Heaven?”
“If the Hall Master cannot even protect his own son, how can he protect the rest of Shura Hall?”
The Great Elder openly defied Sang Tianyang!
“You…”
Sang Tianyang was enraged and about to speak when several streaks of light shot through the sky from afar.
Dozens of radiant beams approached, led by a man in a moon-white robe, handsome in appearance, holding a jade fan. It was the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion.
Behind him followed several elders with equally terrifying auras, clearly high-ranking members of Tianyuan Pavilion.
“Hall Master Sang, long time no see.”
The Master of Tianyuan Pavilion, fanning himself with his jade fan, landed beside Sang Tianyang with a sly smile, his gaze sweeping maliciously over Chen Ping, “I was just passing by and noticed the intense energy fluctuations here. I thought some master was sparring.”
