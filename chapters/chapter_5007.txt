The Inspector’s eyes suddenly narrowed, and he hurriedly retreated, clearly wary of the Mo Family Spear.
Seeing this, Chen Ping immediately swung his sword forward, aiming to slay the Inspector while he was hesitant.
“One Sword to Settle the Universe…”
Chen Ping unleashed a sword strike, the Dragon-Slaying Sword erupting with a burst of sword energy that transformed into a golden dragon, its body engulfed in flames, roaring as it charged towards the Inspector.
The Inspector’s strength was formidable, so Chen Ping had to unleash his most powerful strike.
For this sword, Chen Ping not only used the immortal energy within his body but also fused the power of the divine dragon, the origin of fire, and various other forces.
He aimed to kill the Inspector with this single strike.
The Inspector, sensing the power of Chen Ping’s sword, no longer showed any trace of disdain, his face drastically changing.
But at this moment, he had no way to dodge, as Chen Ping’s sword was too fast and perfectly timed.
The Inspector roared, crossing his fists and swinging them with full force!
With both fists unleashed, using all his life’s strength, the void itself seemed to distort under the power.
Boom!
With a deafening explosion, Chen Ping’s body was instantly sent flying backwards.
The Inspector didn’t fare well either, both his arms shattered under the strike.
Without his arms, the Inspector knew he could no longer fight and tried to retreat.
But the white-clad girl’s spear was already before him.
Purple rays of light enveloped the Inspector’s entire body!
Gritting his teeth, the Inspector’s soul instantly left his body, and at that moment, his physical form exploded under the purple light!
“The Mo Family Spear, truly lives up to its reputation!”
The Inspector’s soul retreated, attempting to escape!
“Still trying to run?” The white-clad girl, spear in hand, was about to pursue, but several figures appeared in the sky, arriving in an instant.
These were all members of the Eight Halls, blocking the Inspector’s path!
At the same time, the ground trembled, and the soldiers of Feihu City, who had fled earlier, all returned to fight!
Xie Zhong was among them, forced to return, as Huo Zhao personally oversaw the battle behind him, leaving Xie Zhong no choice!
Seeing this, the white-clad girl stopped pursuing and reached out to pull Chen Ping up!
Chen Ping’s forehead was covered in cold sweat, and he was panting heavily.
This battle had drained him significantly.
If not for the appearance of the white-clad girl, Chen Ping feared he wouldn’t have been able to handle the Divine Hall’s Inspector and would have needed the Red Cloud Demon Lord to possess him.
Seeing the Eight Halls’ members arrive, the Inspector’s expression calmed.
Though his physical body was gone, as long as his soul remained, he could reshape a body, it would just take time.
“Inspector…” Huo Zhao approached the Inspector, his attitude extremely respectful.
The Inspectors were akin to the Divine Hall’s enforcers, tasked with inspecting the various sub-halls, much like a disciplinary committee.
The Inspector’s eyes glinted with coldness as he glared at Huo Zhao, “Order an attack to eliminate them, and escort me back to the Hall, I need to reshape my body.”
“Yes, sir!” Huo Zhao nodded, then turned to Xie Zhong, “Everyone, attack! Anyone who dares flee will have their soul obliterated!”
Hearing this, Xie Zhong reluctantly commanded, “Kill!”
The remaining soldiers of Feihu City charged towards Chen Ping and the white-clad girl!
A dark, overwhelming mass of people against just two.
At this moment, Xie Zhong dared not hold back.
Huo Zhao glanced at Chen Ping, his expression complex, then protected the Inspector’s soul and quickly left.
If the Inspector truly met misfortune in his territory, he, the Lord of the Eighth Hall, would be in trouble.
Chen Ping watched the dark mass of people rushing towards them, his brows tightly furrowed!
“What are you thinking?” the white-clad girl asked.
“I’m thinking whether to run…”
Chen Ping said!
“What do you think?” The white-clad girl smiled.
“Run…”
With that, Chen Ping turned to flee!
