After Huo Zhao finished speaking, he took a step forward, heading straight towards Chen Ping!
At that moment, Chen Ping was undergoing his tribulation, with terrifying bolts of lightning relentlessly striking his body!
“All cultivators of Sun-Moon City, heed my command, protect Mr. Chen with your lives.”
“Under no circumstances let him get close…” Lin Chong roared!
Upon hearing this, the many cultivators of Sun-Moon City unleashed their last reserves of strength!
Having just endured a great battle with no time to recover, these Sun-Moon City cultivators knew that facing Huo Zhao now was like throwing eggs at a rock!
But with Emperor Lin’s orders, they had to obey, even if it meant sacrificing their lives!
These cultivators formed a human wall in front of Chen Ping, determined to shield him with their very existence!
“I’ll block his strike…”
At that moment, the Tenth Hall Master flashed forward, releasing all the energy within his body!
“A member of the Divine Temple?” Huo Zhao’s brow furrowed the instant he saw the Tenth Hall Master!
“Correct, I am the Tenth Hall Master of the Divine Temple!” the Tenth Hall Master nodded.
“Since you’re from the Divine Temple, why are you helping that Chen Ping fellow?”
“I’ll tell you this, I’m an elder of the Huo Family, but I’m also the Eighth Hall Master of the Divine Temple, I order you to leave at once!” Huo Zhao said coldly to the Tenth Hall Master!
Many from the Huo Family held high positions in the Divine Temple, and Huo Zhao was one of them!
“I’d advise you to leave instead, Mr. Chen isn’t someone you can handle, when the powerful figure backing him shows up, you won’t even have time to cry!” the Tenth Hall Master warned Huo Zhao.
“Insolent! A mere Tenth Hall Master dares to speak to me like this? Tired of living, are you?”
Huo Zhao’s brow creased, and with a sudden motion, he slammed his palm downward!
The Tenth Hall Master gritted his teeth, refusing to dodge, instead unleashing his full power with a single punch!
Boom!
The Tenth Hall Master’s punch shook the heavens and earth, dimming the sun and moon, the terrifying fist wind raged like a storm!
Yet, this fearsome punch shattered the moment it met the casual force of Huo Zhao’s palm, vanishing without a trace!
At the same time, the Tenth Hall Master felt an overwhelming, mountain-crushing force crashing towards him!
His body flew backwards like a kite with a snapped string, crashing heavily to the ground!
“Father…”
Yun Li rushed over to check on him!
“The enemy’s too strong, we can’t hold him…”
The Tenth Hall Master spat blood, his face full of helplessness!
This was with Huo Zhao not even using his true body, if it had been his real form, that single palm strike would’ve turned him to ash!
Wuji Daoist and Lin Chong exchanged a glance, their faces equally grim, that one palm strike had shown them Huo Zhao’s strength was extraordinary!
Li Chunfeng and Nan Batian leapt forward, “You little brat, get lost now, and we’ll spare your life.”
Huo Zhao glanced at Li Chunfeng and Nan Batian, slightly surprised, “Celestial Realm cultivators, are you two trapped here in the Celestial Realm?”
“None of your bloody business, we’re telling you to scram, or we won’t hold back!” Nan Batian bellowed!
Huo Zhao merely smiled, “Even if you’re from the Celestial Realm, so what? Your strength’s down to a third at best, even together, you’re no match for me.”
“I don’t want to make too many enemies, so since you’re Celestial Realm cultivators, I’ll spare you, get lost!” Huo Zhao said coldly.
“To hell with you…”
Nan Batian threw a punch!
Seeing this, Li Chunfeng swung his longsword and charged forward, they couldn’t just stand by and let Huo Zhao attack Chen Ping now!
The two attacked Huo Zhao together, and upon seeing this, Lin Chong and Wuji Daoist rushed in as well!
At this point, there was no such thing as ganging up unfairly, they were all in a battered state and had to combine their strength to hold Huo Zhao back!
Four against one, they faced off against Huo Zhao…
