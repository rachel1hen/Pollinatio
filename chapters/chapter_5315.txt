Li Chunfeng said gravely. “If we clash head-on, our chances of victory are slim. We can only hold fast and wait for reinforcements. I have already sent messages to several old friends in Sword Saint City. I hope they can act out of old affection.”
Chen Ping shook his head. “We cannot wait. Since Qin Lie dares to come, he must have made full preparations. Delaying will only disadvantage us.”
He looked at the crowd; a flash of determination passed through his eyes. “If they come tomorrow, I will go to meet Qin Lie!”
“No!” Mo Chen hurriedly stopped him. “Qin Lie is at Earth Immortal Realm eighth grade. You are no match for him at all!”
“Master, rest assured. I have my own way.” Chen Ping smiled faintly and took out an item from his storage ring.
It was a long bow entirely black; intricate golden patterns were carved on the bow body, faintly emitting a dragon’s might.
“This is…” Li Chunfeng’s pupils contracted sharply. “The Divine King Bow? You actually have such a divine artifact!”
Chen Ping nodded. “This bow can amplify my power. Perhaps I can fight Qin Lie.”
Nan Batian’s eyes lit up. “Good lad. You hid it deep! With this treasure, we might really turn the tables!”
“But unless absolutely necessary, do not use it.” Li Chunfeng said seriously. “The Divine King Bow is an ancient divine artifact. Once it appears in the world, it will likely attract even greater trouble.”
Chen Ping fell silent. He knew Li Chunfeng spoke the truth.
In this world where the weak are prey to the strong, he understood the principle of possessing a treasure inviting disaster better than anyone.
As night deepened, the Sword Sect residence remained brightly lit.
Everyone was making final preparations; the sounds of chanting scriptures and the humming of talismans intertwined, composing a tragic war song.
Chen Ping stood alone on the rooftop, gazing at the waning moon on the horizon.
He gently stroked the Divine King Bow, feeling the dormant power within.
“Red Cloud Demon Lord, what exactly are you up to?”
Chen Ping muttered in his heart. Since in the Black Wind Mountain Range, the Red Cloud Demon Lord had reminded Chen Ping once and then fallen silent again. No matter how Chen Ping called, there was no response.
Just then, the storage ring suddenly warmed slightly.
Chen Ping’s heart stirred. After probing with his divine sense, he surprisingly found that the Fire Qilin’s body had grown considerably larger; faint red light emanated from its entire body.
“Is it about to break through?”
Chen Ping was delighted in his heart. If the Fire Qilin could break through at this moment, it would undoubtedly add a major boost.
Chen Ping carefully placed some resources into the storage ring for the Fire Qilin to consume.
Not far from the Fire Qilin, the little Heaven-Devouring Beast was snoring away. This fellow’s body had not changed in the slightest.
It knew only to eat and sleep, sleep and eat all day. If the little Heaven-Devouring Beast could obey commands, Chen Ping would have no need to fear Qin Lie and the others at all.
“When tomorrow comes, perhaps we will fight side by side.”
Chen Ping looked at the Fire Qilin and said softly!
Regarding the battle against Qin Lie’s forces, if he used only sword techniques, Chen Ping had no confidence. So Chen Ping planned to use his ultimate skills.
What Divine King Bow, origin power, divine dragon power, powers of the three clans, Fire Qilin…
He planned to expose himself completely. To survive, he had no choice!
As the east showed a fish-belly white, the alarm bells of Sword Saint City suddenly rang; the sharp sound pierced the tranquility of dawn.
Chen Ping gripped the Dragon-Slaying Sword tightly; a trace of fierceness flashed in his eyes. “They’re here!”
At the east gate of Sword Saint City, a dense crowd surged like a tide, surrounding the entire Sword Sect residence impenetrably.
Qin Lie rode a one-horned rhinoceros, clad in purple-gold armour, holding a treasured sword. He looked down from above at the courtyard wall ahead.
Behind him, the blood-armoured cultivators from the Sixth Hall of the Divine Hall, the black-robed evil cultivators from the Evil Path Hall, and experts from various sects were densely packed, with soaring killing intent.
“Chen Ping! Come out and die!”
Qin Lie’s voice exploded like thunder, shaking the courtyard walls with a buzzing sound.
Li Chunfeng stepped into the air; his white clothes were whiter than snow, and the long sword in his hand pointed straight at Qin Lie. “Qin Lie, you dare to run wild in Sword Saint City. Do you really think this old man does not exist?”
