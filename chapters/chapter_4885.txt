Wen Nanxing had gone mad, heedless even of his own children, watching helplessly as the Wen Qing and Wen Shi siblings perished under the terrifying aura of his burning soul!
Mr. Shi gave a faint smile, his eyes brimming with contempt!
With a casual wave of his hand, that fearsome aura vanished once more, and Wen Nanxing’s chest was struck again by some unseen force, a bloody hole reappearing!
Wen Nanxing stood rooted to the spot, staring down at the hole in his chest, silent!
The world fell into a deathly stillness once again!
Wen Nanxing had been instantly defeated, again!
“Why? Why is this happening?”
Wen Nanxing wept!
His face was full of disbelief, unable to comprehend why this was occurring!
All along, the Fire Incineration Sect had been the top power in the Celestial Realm, his strength universally acknowledged as invincible here, so how had this Mr. Shi suddenly appeared out of nowhere?
He could have ascended long ago, but to bask in the Celestial Realm’s adulation, to revel in his unmatched fame, he’d delayed his ascent to the Heavenly Realm!
Yet in the end, how had it come to this?
Where did this Mr. Shi even come from?
In his presence, Wen Nanxing didn’t even have the slightest ability to fight back!
Despair consumed him, a torment worse than death itself!
Even more despairing than Wen Nanxing were the remaining Fire Incineration Sect powerhouses who hadn’t yet died!
They stood there, dumbfounded, these were all Immortal Transformation Realm cultivators, capable of standing toe-to-toe with Lin Chong and the others!
“Run…”
At that moment, the only thought in the minds of these Fire Incineration Sect elites was escape!
A dozen of them suddenly scattered in all directions, fleeing with every ounce of strength they had!
“We can’t let them get away…”
Seeing this, Chen Ping moved to give chase!
Lin Chong and the others leapt to follow!
But Mr. Shi merely raised his hand!
Pfft!
The dozen Fire Incineration Sect elites, fleeing in every direction, exploded into nothingness at the exact same moment!
They weren’t even running in the same direction, and their distances varied!
Yet with one casual gesture from Mr. Shi, they all burst apart simultaneously!
Their storage pouches floated back slowly, landing in front of Chen Ping!
“For you…” Mr. Shi said!
Chen Ping wanted to laugh but held it in, collecting the pouches!
Lin Chong and the others were utterly numb!
These were Immortal Transformation Realm cultivators, any one of whom could dominate a region in the Celestial Realm!
Especially the Five Domain Lords, rulers of the five regions, their every appearance dictating the life and death of countless cultivators!
In the eyes of Celestial Realm cultivators, these Domain Lords were gods, masters of fate!
But now, before Mr. Shi, they weren’t even ants!
Wen Nanxing watched as the sect’s elites were slaughtered in an instant, his face devoid of any expression!
Though he still lived, he might as well have been dead!
Just as Chen Ping, Lin Chong, and the others rejoiced, the entire Celestial Realm suddenly plunged into darkness!
It was as if the end of days had descended, and a terrifying aura slowly drew near!
Everyone saw it, at the horizon, a bronze coffin was drifting through the air!
And atop that coffin sat a figure!
As the coffin approached, Chen Ping finally recognized him, it was Wen Haotian!
Lin Chong and the others stared at the coffin and the man atop it, all sinking into a profound dread!
Even without a hint of pressure from him, just a simple glance made their hearts feel as though they’d fallen into a bottomless abyss!
That fear seemed innate, unleashed from the depths of their souls with just one look at the man on the coffin!
“You’ve come…”
Mr. Shi looked at Wen Haotian, giving a slight smile!
“What’s meant to come will always come!”
Wen Haotian returned a faint smile!
The two spoke as if they were old friends!
