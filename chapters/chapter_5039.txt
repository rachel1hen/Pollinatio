“Tch, if you won’t teach me, fine, I’ll go play with those two beauties instead…”
Hu Mazi rolled his eyes and turned to leave!
Zhao Yu knew he had found Mo Qingyun and hoped she could talk to Lan Lianhua, then make a trip to the Floating Island.
“Friend Chen, no need to talk to her. If you want to go to the Floating Island, I’ll take you there myself.”
“I can call the shots for half of this Cangxuan Continent…”
Mo Qingyun said with a smile!
Having lived here for many years, she was very familiar with the Floating Island.
“Alright then!” Chen Ping nodded!
Mo Qingyun led Chen Ping, leaping into the air and heading straight for the Floating Island.
In just a dozen minutes, the two arrived on the island.
The island was as beautiful as ever, though without Lan Lianhua’s permission, no one was allowed to set foot here.
“Friend Chen, if you like it, you could stay here forever. The immortal energy here is much denser than elsewhere.”
Mo Qingyun said!
“Miss Mo, have you lived on this Floating Island for many years?” Chen Ping asked!
“Yes, many years. I love the environment here.” Mo Qingyun nodded!
“Have you ever felt that this Floating Island is different, or perhaps strange in some way?”
Chen Ping asked!
Mo Qingyun thought for a moment, then shook her head, “No, it’s just a floating island, isn’t it? What’s so special about it?”
“For such a massive island to float in mid-air, that in itself is abnormal.”
“This island is likely being held up by a massive formation, not naturally formed.”
Chen Ping shared his speculation.
“Impossible. An island this big would require an enormous formation!”
“And such a vast formation would consume tremendous energy. This Floating Island has existed for tens of thousands of years—how could it be supported by a formation?”
Mo Qingyun didn’t believe it at all.
She couldn’t believe anyone could create such a colossal formation, nor that it could operate stably for so many years.
Seeing her skepticism, Chen Ping didn’t argue further and began searching the Floating Island for evidence of the formation!
Instead of explaining more, Chen Ping started carefully inspecting the island.
He gathered spiritual energy at his fingertips, lightly tracing the ground, sensing the flow of energy in every inch of the land.
Mo Qingyun stood with her arms crossed, a hint of doubt in her eyes, “Friend Chen, you don’t seriously think this island is held up by a formation, do you?”
Chen Ping didn’t respond, instead pausing abruptly before an unremarkable rock.
He crouched down, placed his palm on the stone, and closed his eyes to sense it.
“Strange…” His brow furrowed slightly, “The spiritual energy fluctuations here seem to be deliberately guided by some force.”
Mo Qingyun, seeing his serious expression, couldn’t help but lean closer, “Found something?”
Chen Ping swiped his finger, peeling away the moss on the rock to reveal an ancient rune beneath.
The rune was faint, yet it carried a sense of ancient desolation.
“This is… an ancient formation rune?” Mo Qingyun’s pupils contracted, starting to believe.
“Not just this one.” Chen Ping stood up, scanning the surroundings, “The entire island’s spiritual veins are guided by these runes, forming a massive levitation formation.”
Mo Qingyun was utterly shocked, “But how has this formation been sustained for so many years? Where does the energy come from?”
Chen Ping didn’t answer, instead following the direction indicated by the runes toward the island’s centre.
Mo Qingyun, seeing this, hurriedly followed.
The two arrived at a clear lake at the heart of the island, its waters so transparent yet unfathomably deep.
“The formation’s core should be at the bottom of this lake,” Chen Ping said gravely.
“You’re going down there?” Mo Qingyun hesitated, “The lake looks calm, but who knows what’s below?”
