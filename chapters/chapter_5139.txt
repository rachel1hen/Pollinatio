The middle-aged man turned to ash, and all his clan members were devoured by the thunder tribulation!
After an unknown amount of time, the thunder tribulation vanished, and the scene fell into a deathly silence!
The ground was littered with corpses, reeking of blood!
Chen Ping dispelled the golden shield, his face pale and his body visibly weakened!
Saving these dozens of people had nearly exhausted all his strength. Saving others was beyond his capability!
“Why, why didn’t you save our clan leader? You clearly could have!”
The white-robed youth glared at Chen Ping, accusing him angrily!
Hu Mazi and the others rushed over, and Hu Mazi slapped the white-robed youth across the face.
“Remember, he can save you, but he can also kill you!”
After speaking, Hu Mazi supported Chen Ping and asked, “Are you alright?”
“I’m fine!” Chen Ping shook his head, but suddenly his brows furrowed, his eyes warily glancing into the distance!
“They’re coming…”
Chen Ping said gravely!
“Let’s go…” Hu Mazi sensed it too and immediately fled with Chen Ping and the others!
The dozens of Worry-Free Clan cultivators followed suit!
Just as they left, three figures cloaked in black robes appeared, looking at the corpses strewn across the ground with satisfied smiles.
The three divided their tasks and began collecting the souls from the corpses!
Chen Ping and the others fled thousands of miles before stopping!
At this moment, Chen Ping was panting heavily. The earlier exertion had been immense, and he hadn’t had time to recover before fleeing such a distance!
“It seems my physical body still needs training. Otherwise, I won’t be able to withstand that blood-red thunder tribulation and reach the Fourth Heaven.”
Feeling the exhaustion and pain in his body, Chen Ping said with deep emotion!
He decided to find an opportunity to practice the Barbaric Body Refining Technique to make his physical body stronger!
His strength had grown too quickly recently, and his physical tempering had clearly fallen behind!
Coupled with the repeated possessions by the Red Cloud Demon Lord, which left his body riddled with injuries, Chen Ping knew he had to strengthen his physical form urgently!
“Fellow cultivator, thank you for saving our lives!”
The girl approached and thanked Chen Ping!
“Thank him for what? He only did it because he took all our resources. It’s a transaction, no need to thank him.”
“Besides, he could have saved the clan leader but chose to stand by. This kind of person has no compassion.”
The white-robed youth glared at Chen Ping, as if looking at an enemy!
“Shut your mouth…”
The girl, furious, shouted at the white-robed youth!
Chen Ping coldly stared at the youth, then waved his hand lightly, and countless storage bags appeared before everyone!
“Which of these is your storage bag?”
Chen Ping asked the white-robed youth.
“I…” The youth opened his mouth but said nothing!
“Fellow cultivator, this guy has a foul mouth. Please don’t be angry!” the girl hurriedly apologised to Chen Ping.
Chen Ping ignored her and continued asking the white-robed youth, “Which is your storage bag? Take it now…”
The youth waved his hand, and a storage bag flew into his grasp!
“This is my storage bag!”
The white-robed youth declared!
“Since you’ve taken your storage bag, I no longer owe you anything. I saved your life, so it’s time I take it back!”
Chen Ping said coldly!
The youth froze, then shouted, “What are you going to do?”
“Fellow cultivator, he knows he was wrong. Please…”
The girl tried to apologise to Chen Ping!
But Chen Ping suddenly swung his hand, the Dragon-Slaying Sword appearing. A sword beam flashed out!
The white-robed youth had no time to react before his head was severed.
