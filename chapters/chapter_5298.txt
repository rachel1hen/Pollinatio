Li Xiuyuan’s eyes flashed with a trace of despair. He opened his mouth as if wanting to say something, but in the end, he only let out a muffled sound. His head then separated from his body.
With Li Xiuyuan’s death, a commotion arose inside the Holy Light Sect’s mountain gate. Countless disciples dressed in pure white robes rushed out, surrounding the three people.
“Protect the sect!”
“Kill these demonic heretics!”
The disciples roared in anger. Their silver long swords erupted with golden light, forming a sea of golden swords that surged towards the three.
Chen Ping looked at these deceived disciples. A trace of complexity flashed in his eyes, but it was quickly replaced by coldness.
“Those who block me will die!”
He let out a long howl. The Dragon-Slaying Sword erupted with unprecedented light. The sword aura interwoven with gold and black soared into the sky like a raging dragon, instantly tearing apart the sea of golden swords.
The sword light was like a dragon; the murderous aura was like hell.
Chen Ping slashed out with one sword. The torrent interwoven with golden light and black aura instantly tore apart the sword sea of the Holy Light Sect disciples.
The dozens of disciples in the front row did not even have time to scream before they were ground into powder by the sword qi. Fragments of white robes mixed with golden glows, falling like a bizarre blood rain.
“Madman! He’s a madman!”
The surviving disciples were scared out of their wits by this bloody scene. Their hands holding the long swords trembled, and they no longer dared to advance.
Chen Ping did not pursue. His gaze passed over the crowd, looking towards the most magnificent palace in the depths of the Holy Light Sect: the Holy Light Hall.
“Master Hu, Shizun, I’ll leave the cleanup of the small fry to you.”
“I’ll go meet their sect master.”
Before his words finished, his figure had already turned into a streak of flowing light, flying towards the Holy Light Hall.
“Chen Ping, be careful!” Mo Chen and Hu Mazi shouted at the same time.
Mo Chen waved his long sword. Sword qi crisscrossed, forcing back the disciples trying to block Chen Ping: “Master Hu, let’s finish this quickly and go help Chen Ping!”
“Alright!”
A trace of ruthlessness flashed in Hu Mazi’s eyes. He took out several talismans, muttering incantations. The talismans turned into several fire dragons, flying towards the crowd.
In an instant, flames soared in front of the Holy Light Sect’s mountain gate. Screams and the sounds of weapons clashing were incessant.
Chen Ping sped along the way. The disciples en route could not block his steps at all.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword swung casually, able to kill groups of disciples. Those so-called holy light defences were like paper in front of his murderous aura.
Soon, he arrived in front of the Holy Light Hall.
The Holy Light Hall was entirely built from white jade. The roof was covered with golden glazed tiles, shimmering dazzlingly under the sunlight.
On both sides of the hall door stood two huge angel statues. They held long swords in their hands, with solemn expressions, as if guarding some sacred secret.
Chen Ping did not knock. He directly kicked out.
“Boom!”
The heavy hall door was kicked flying by him. Wood chips scattered everywhere.
Inside the hall, an old man in a purple long robe was sitting in the main seat. His hair and beard were all white; his face was kind. He exuded a gentle yet powerful aura. He was the sect master of the Holy Light Sect, an eighth-grade Earth Immortal cultivator, Wang Shengguang.
In front of Wang Shengguang knelt several trembling elders, obviously having just received the news.
Seeing Chen Ping burst in, Wang Shengguang slowly raised his head. There was no trace of surprise in his eyes, only a calm like an ancient well without waves.
“You’ve finally come.”
Wang Shengguang’s voice was gentle, yet carried an unquestionable majesty. “I’ve been waiting for this day for hundreds of years.”
Chen Ping frowned: “You knew I would come?”
“Of course.” Wang Shengguang smiled faintly. “The descendants of the Hu clan would come to seek revenge on us sooner or later. I just didn’t expect it to be a young genius like you.”
He stood up. His purple long robe fluttered without wind. The golden light around him grew denser: “Your murderous aura is very special; it can actually counter my holy light. Moreover, you’re only at the Loose Immortal realm, yet you beat Earth Immortal realm cultivators without them having any power to fight back.”
“If I’m not mistaken, you should be that Chen Ping who shone brightly in Sword Saint City, right?”
