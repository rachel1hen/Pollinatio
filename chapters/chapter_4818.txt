“Thousand Butterfly Storm!”
The Tang Sect Grand Elder let out a low shout, flinging his hands forward. In an instant, countless butterfly daggers morphed into a massive storm barrier, shielding him.
Within the storm, the daggers spun like lightning, buzzing loudly, as if thousands of butterflies danced in a gale.
The Holy Light Fist slammed into the Thousand Butterfly Storm, unleashing a deafening roar.
Golden fist shadows clashed with the silver storm in midair, forming a dazzling curtain of light. Inside the tavern, onlookers covered their ears, their eyes wide with awe.
“This… the power of that punch is insane,” the red-haired old man gaped, staring at the showdown in disbelief.
Young Master Ming’s lips curled slightly, a glint of excitement in his eyes, “As expected, Chen Ping’s no ordinary guy. He doesn’t even need the sword, this punch alone is enough to shake a fourth-rank Immortal Transformation Realm expert!”
In the sky, Chen Ping’s fist shadow was gradually swallowed by the storm, but the Grand Elder’s face didn’t relax.
He could clearly feel that Chen Ping’s fist energy hadn’t fully dissipated, instead, it was gathering within the storm, as if it could break through his defence at any moment.
“Immortal Finger!” Chen Ping growled, his figure flashing as he appeared at the Grand Elder’s flank in an instant.
Golden light danced at his fingertips, and with a point, the beam shot straight at the Grand Elder.
“Immortal Finger!” The Grand Elder’s pupils shrank, his heart gripped by dread.
He hadn’t expected Chen Ping to wield such an advanced immortal technique, this finger’s power surpassing even the Holy Light Fist.
As the Immortal Finger tore through the void, everything around seemed to freeze!
“The Origin of Time?”
Inside the tavern, Young Master Ming stood up, the smirk fading from his face as he stared silently at Chen Ping in the air!
A third-rank Transcendence Realm cultivator grasping the Origin of Time, even controlling it, this went beyond all his expectations.
For the first time, a trace of solemnity crossed Young Master Ming’s face!
“What’s this kid’s deal? How’s he this terrifying? Could he be backed by heavenly beings? How else does he know so many divine techniques?”
The red-haired old man muttered in shock!
Everyone else stared blankly, faces etched with disbelief!
“When did this guy pick up all these tricks?”
Lin Kefan swallowed hard, stunned!
Hidden in the crowd, the Tenth Hall Master silently rejoiced. Had he not sided with Chen Ping, with his current strength, he’d likely be a corpse under Chen Ping’s sword by now!
At the far edge of the crowd, Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi had been watching Chen Ping’s fight all along!
From slaying the Spirit Sect Master to now facing off with the Tang Sect Grand Elder, pulling out moves like the Holy Light Fist and Immortal Finger, Ning Zhi felt a growing sense of inferiority!
“Junior brother, this guy’s not easy to kill…” Su Yuqi said slowly!
“Senior sister, maybe others can’t kill him, but I believe you absolutely can, absolutely…”
Ning Zhi brimmed with confidence and certainty!
Because only he knew that the moment Su Yuqi revealed her face, Chen Ping would be dumbfounded and wouldn’t dare strike her!
When that happened, Chen Ping would be a lamb to the slaughter!
Meanwhile, the Tang Sect Grand Elder, wide-eyed with shock, didn’t dare slack off. He clapped his hands together, and the Thousand Butterfly Storm shrank instantly into a silver light shield in front of him.
But in Chen Ping’s eyes, every move now unfolded in slow motion.
The golden finger beam didn’t wait for the shield to fully form, it had already shot towards the Grand Elder.
“Pfft!”
Struck by the finger, the Grand Elder spat blood, his body hurtling backwards, crashing into the ground and leaving a deep crater.
