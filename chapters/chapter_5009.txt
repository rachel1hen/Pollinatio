“Friend Chen, don’t waste resources on me, I won’t make it.”
“I’ve already gained so much by lasting this long, don’t bother with me…”
Xiu Rui forced a faint smile!
“Nonsense, I say you’ll live, so you’ll live! I have plenty of resources, you don’t need to save them for me!” Chen Ping snapped, cursing!
If Xiu Rui gave up hope of surviving, even a Great Luo Golden Immortal couldn’t save him!
“Cough, cough, cough…”
Xiu Rui spat out another mouthful of blood, mixed with fragments of his organs!
It was clear that Xiu Rui’s injuries were severe.
“Alright, don’t move, I’ll heal you…” Seeing this, Chen Ping knew that if he didn’t treat Xiu Rui soon, he might really die!
“Friend Chen, watch out!”
Xiu Rui’s eyes suddenly widened, and with his last bit of strength, he lunged forward!
Pfft!
A long sword instantly pierced through Xiu Rui’s body, and a black-clad Eight Halls member followed with a kick!
Xiu Rui’s body collapsed again, but this time, his eyes lost their light, unable to speak!
“Damn you…”
Chen Ping was furious, his Dragon-Slaying Sword slashing out a sky-piercing beam of sword light!
It cleaved the black-clad Eight Halls member in half!
But when Chen Ping looked at Xiu Rui, he found he had already stopped breathing!
Chen Ping’s body trembled slightly, his murderous intent soaring to the heavens!
Though he hadn’t known Xiu Rui long, upon hearing of Chen Ping’s danger, Xiu Rui had come without hesitation!
Now he had died here, and in a sense, Xiu Rui died for Chen Ping!
More and more black-clad Eight Halls members surged towards Chen Ping!
“Kill…”
Chen Ping roared, his expression turning ferocious.
“Nine Shadows Sword Technique…”
With a swing of Chen Ping’s Dragon-Slaying Sword!
Instantly, multiple figures appeared, eight identical Chen Pings, each holding a Dragon-Slaying Sword!
Swish!
Eight beams of sword light shot out, and in an instant, the dozen black-clad men rushing towards Chen Ping were all sliced in half at the same moment!
Seeing so many identical Chen Pings appear, everyone was nearly stunned!
But Chen Ping charged forward recklessly!
Though the multiple clones of the Nine Shadows Sword Technique rapidly drained his energy!
It could even lead to him being exhausted to death!
But Chen Ping, in this moment, didn’t care, his mind consumed with only slaughter, to kill all these people!
Chen Ping’s Dragon-Slaying Sword, wrapped in blood-red sword light, brought forth a rain of blood with every swing.
His seven shadow clones danced alongside his real body, shredding any black-clad men who tried to approach into minced flesh.
On the ground, bodies piled up like mountains, thick blood pooling into streams, glinting eerily under the moonlight, staining this Asura battlefield red.
Yet, the soldiers of Feihu City and the black-clad Eight Halls members seemed endless, coming in wave after wave.
Chen Ping could clearly feel the spiritual energy in his body draining like a breached dam, each swing of his sword like overdrawing his life.
His face grew paler, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, but the murderous intent in his eyes didn’t waver, his mind fixed on one thought: kill them all!
“Kill—!!!”
Chen Ping’s eyes blazed red, his killing aura surging like a tangible force, each swing of the Dragon-Slaying Sword bringing a shower of blood.
The soldiers of Feihu City and the black-clad Eight Halls members came like a tide, only to fall like stalks of wheat.
But there were simply too many enemies!
“Chen Ping! If you keep going like this, you’ll die of exhaustion!”
Hu Mazi shouted through gritted teeth, his talismans exploding to repel several black-clad men, but his face was as pale as paper, clearly nearing his limit.
