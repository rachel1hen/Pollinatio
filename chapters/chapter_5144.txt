Ling Yunxiao’s golden dragon was merely an illusion formed by sword energy, but the golden dragon behind Chen Ping was vivid and lifelike, its dragon might vast and utterly real!
“Activate the formation, open the mountain protection array…”
Ling Yunxiao, finally aware of Chen Ping’s power, roared urgently to activate the protective array!
Creak…
As Elder Zhao and others channelled beams of light from their palms into Tianyan Peak, a glow began to rise around the Tianyan Sect, the sect’s protective array springing to life!
“Hmph, rubbish…”
Chen Ping sneered, and the golden dragon behind him let out a fierce roar!
The Tianyan Sect’s protective array, under the dragon’s overwhelming pressure, emitted a strained cracking sound, the light at its core dimming before collapsing instantly.
“This… this golden dragon isn’t an illusion?”
Feeling the dragon’s might, Ling Yunxiao’s pupils contracted sharply, his face drained of colour, his body staggering back as if all strength had been sapped, “You… who are you? Are you from the Golden Dragon Clan?”
Legends of the Golden Dragon Clan had long circulated in the Heavenly Realm.
The Golden Dragon Clan, the noblest bloodline among the exalted dragon race, here in the Third Heaven? Could someone from the Golden Dragon Clan be present?
Ling Yunxiao couldn’t believe it, yet the golden dragon behind Chen Ping stood undeniably real before his eyes!
As Chen Ping’s strength grew, his bloodline became purer, and the golden dragon more tangible!
“Isn’t it a bit late to realise now?”
Chen Ping smiled faintly!
“Spare me! Senior, please spare me!”
Seeing Chen Ping’s confirmation, Ling Yunxiao discarded all traces of the old sect master’s dignity, dropping to his knees with a thud, kowtowing repeatedly to Chen Ping, “I was blind, the Tianyan Sect was blind! Please, Senior, show mercy and spare our Tianyan Sect!”
Elder Zhao and the other high-ranking Tianyan Sect members followed suit, kneeling and kowtowing frantically.
If they had known Chen Ping was from the Golden Dragon Clan, they wouldn’t have dared to challenge him, not with ten thousand times their courage!
The Golden Dragon Clan was a lofty existence in the Heavenly Realm; a mere sneeze from them could obliterate not just the Tianyan Sect, but likely the entire Third Heaven!
“Senior, spare us! We failed to recognise your greatness!”
“Please, Senior, show mercy, we’ll offer all our resources, just leave us a way to survive!”
“It’s all Xuan Jizi’s fault, he stole your treasure and offended you, please spare us, Senior!”
The once-arrogant Tianyan Sect members now had none of their immortal sect grandeur, only fear and desperate pleas remained.
Chen Ping looked coldly at the kowtowing crowd at his feet, his eyes devoid of any pity.
In this dog-eat-dog world, playing the saint was simply irresponsible to oneself.
If Chen Ping’s strength were lacking, they would never have spared him.
“Begging now? Too late.”
Chen Ping uttered two words, his voice soft but carrying the weight of a death sentence.
With a wave of his right hand, the golden dragon pressed down fiercely.
“No!!!”
“Help…”
Screams echoed across Tianyan Peak, but they were quickly swallowed by the golden dragon’s terrifying pressure.
All resistance from the Tianyan Sect was like paper before Chen Ping, shattering instantly.
Whether it was the pleading Ling Yunxiao, the previously overbearing Elder Zhao, or the ordinary disciples, in the face of Chen Ping’s power, they were all erased like ants.
Flesh and blood scattered, no corpses remained; the once-glorious Tianyan Sect turned into a bloody ruin in mere breaths.
The air was thick with the stench of blood and the aura of spiritual energy explosions. Chen Ping recalled the golden dragon, his face expressionless, as if he had merely crushed a few ants.
“Search.” Chen Ping said calmly to Yun Wuya.
Yun Wuya, still in shock, snapped to attention at Chen Ping’s words. Fortunately, the Qingyun Sect disciples had arrived, so Yun Wuya immediately led them to begin scavenging!
