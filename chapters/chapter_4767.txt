“Now that you know this isn’t an illusion, it’s already too late…”
Chen Ping’s eyes turned cold as he swung the Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand.
All six clones mirrored his movements, their sword energies converging into one. The combined force was unimaginably powerful!
*Boom!*
The Ten Hall Master threw a punch, and with a deafening explosion, the sword light shattered. Both Chen Ping and the Ten Hall Master were sent flying backward.
This time, Chen Ping’s body slammed into a mountain peak before coming to a stop.
The peak crumbled, and Chen Ping felt his internal organs churn violently. He spat out a mouthful of blood.
The Ten Hall Master, too, was sent flying, crashing into another mountain and destroying it.
Meanwhile, Hua Yueying stood with her eyes closed, continuously reinforcing her illusion array.
At this moment, she couldn’t spare any attention to help Chen Ping. Everything depended on him now.
Chen Ping looked at the Ten Hall Master, who was also in bad shape. One of his arms was split open, blood pouring out.
Cracks began to spread across the Ten Hall Master’s body, as if he were on the verge of collapse.
It seemed even the Ten Hall Master’s physical body was reaching its limit.
The Ten Hall Master glared at Chen Ping, who was still alive, his eyes filled with rage.
As a Third Grade Transformation Realm cultivator, he should have been able to easily crush Chen Ping, who was only at the Second Grade Great Ascension Realm.
Yet, not only could Chen Ping fight above his level, but he also possessed numerous divine weapons and treasures.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword, the Divine King’s Bow, the Indestructible Golden Body…
Any one of these treasures was something most cultivators could only dream of obtaining.
Especially Chen Ping’s Indestructible Golden Body, now enhanced by the golden dragon. Even if it were damaged, it could instantly repair itself.
This made it incredibly difficult for the Ten Hall Master to kill Chen Ping.
Just as Chen Ping and the Ten Hall Master were locked in their standoff, a sudden disturbance occurred behind Chen Ping. A spatial rift appeared out of nowhere.
Without hesitation, Chen Ping treated whoever was coming through the rift as an enemy.
*Swish!*
Chen Ping swung his sword at the spatial rift, and a shadowy figure was sent flying.
“Damn it, I took a wrong turn…”
The figure cursed as it vanished into the horizon.
It turned out to be a cultivator who had been traveling through spatial rifts and accidentally stumbled into their battlefield.
As soon as he appeared, he was struck by Chen Ping’s sword and sent flying.
“This isn’t the illusion array?”
The Ten Hall Master stared at the figure that had been sent flying, his eyes widening in shock.
The environment they were in wasn’t an illusion—it was real!
They weren’t inside the illusion array at all.
If they had been in the illusion array, the figure struck by Chen Ping’s sword wouldn’t have appeared, nor would it have been possible to tear through the void within an illusion.
“That’s right. This isn’t an illusion. This is the real Heavenly Realm. We’re currently in the Northern Region of the Heavenly Realm,” Chen Ping said with a cold smile.
Earlier, when Chen Ping had asked Hua Yueying to set up the illusion array, it had all been a diversion.
He knew that Elder Qian could predict their next moves, which was why he had made that suggestion.
While Hua Yueying was setting up the illusion array, Chen Ping had used his understanding of the laws of the grand formation to transport everyone from the Ten Halls to the Northern Region of the Heavenly Realm.
The Ten Halls were merely a space carved out within the Heavenly Realm, similar to a secret realm in the mortal world. Transporting everyone out wasn’t particularly difficult.
This wasn’t a crossing between two different realms—it was all within the same space.
However, to prevent the Ten Hall Master and the others from noticing, Chen Ping had used Hua Yueying’s illusion array as a smokescreen.
Chen Ping had done this to leave them an escape route. If the battle turned against them, they could flee.
Additionally, if the Ten Halls sent reinforcements, it would take time for them to locate this place.
Most importantly, Chen Ping wanted to see if Elder Qian and the Ten Hall Master were remnants of the Heavenly Realm.
If these individuals were indeed remnants of the Heavenly Realm, they would be suppressed by the grand formation of the Heavenly Realm, unable to unleash their full strength.
In a carved-out space like the Ten Halls, the suppression would be much weaker.
