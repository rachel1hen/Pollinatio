A glint of resolve flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes as he prepared to burn his essence blood for a desperate fight with the Sixth Hall Master. Suddenly, a clear, cold female voice rang from the sky: “Sixth Hall Master, bullying the weak—does that make you worthy of being a Divine Hall Master?”
Before the words faded, a white figure streaked across like a fleeting swan, her whisk flicking lightly, its thousands of silver threads transforming into a rain of radiant light.
Though the silver threads seemed soft, they cut through the Golden Armoured Guards’ battle array like blades. The four guards screamed as they were blasted back, crashing unconscious onto the ground.
The Sixth Hall Master’s pupils contracted as he stared at the plain-clothed maid who appeared, exclaiming, “Yun Xiu? Why are you here?”
Yun Xiu stood before Chen Ping, a crescent jade pendant at her waist glowing softly in the sunlight. Her gaze, cold as ice, landed on the Sixth Hall Master: “By order of the Fourth Hall Master, I’m here to protect Chen Ping. Sixth Hall Master, defying the Fourth Hall Master’s command and mobilising the Golden Armoured Guards to ambush Chen Ping—are you trying to start an internal conflict?”
The Sixth Hall Master laughed as if he’d heard a grand joke, pointing at Chen Ping and roaring, “He killed our Divine Hall members and tarnished our prestige! I see you’ve been brainwashed by the Fourth Hall Master, daring to shield a traitor!”
His tone shifted, a ruthless glint in his eyes. “Yun Xiu, I’m acting on the Third Hall Master’s orders! If you ruin my plans today, the Third Hall Master will hold you accountable, and even the Fourth Hall Master won’t save you!”
Yun Xiu flicked her whisk, silver threads weaving a barrier before her. Her Ninth-Grade Earth Immortal Realm spiritual energy erupted unrestrained, cracking the street’s surface: “If the Third Hall Master has the guts, let him complain to the Divine King Palace. But if you want to touch Mr. Chen, you’ll have to get past my ‘Pure Dust Whisk’ first!”
She stepped forward, her invisible pressure forcing the Sixth Hall Master back half a step. “The Fourth Hall Master holds the Divine King Token, respected even by the Divine King. You rely on the Third Hall Master’s influence to lord over the Sixth Heaven, but you dare cause trouble in the Fifth Heaven? Do you think the Fourth Hall has no one?”
The Sixth Hall Master’s face alternated between pale and flushed. He sensed Yun Xiu’s spiritual energy was even more unfathomable than rumoured, the silver threads of her whisk imbued with the power of spatial laws, capable of tearing his protective spiritual energy with a single strand.
But thinking of the Third Hall Master’s methods, he steeled himself: “Yun Xiu, don’t push me! If I let Chen Ping go today, the Third Hall Master will never forgive me!”
“That’s your problem.”
Yun Xiu’s fingertips gathered a wisp of silver-white spiritual energy, twisting into strange arcs in the air, clearly the beginnings of a spatial blade. “Either leave with your men now, or I’ll clean house for the Fourth Hall Master. Choose.”
Seeing the unmasked killing intent in Yun Xiu’s eyes and glancing at Chen Ping, now supported by Nan Batian, the Sixth Hall Master gritted his teeth: “Fine! Today, I’ll give the Fourth Hall Master face!”
He roared at the unconscious Golden Armoured Guards, “Useless fools! Get up!” With a venomous glare at Chen Ping, he turned and fled with his men toward the horizon.
Only when the Sixth Hall Master’s aura completely vanished did Yun Xiu retract her spiritual energy. She took four jade bottles from her storage bag and handed them to Nan Batian: “These are ‘Spirit Condensing Powder’ and ‘Flesh Regenerating Ointment.’ Tend to their wounds first.”
Nan Batian took the bottles, his eyes filled with gratitude: “Thank you, Miss Yun Xiu, for saving us. Otherwise, we’d all be dead today.”
He distributed the medicine, first feeding a pill to A Cui, his eyes full of concern as he looked at her pale face.
After taking the medicine, the sharp pain in Chen Ping’s chest eased. He clasped his hands to Yun Xiu: “Thank you for the rescue. I’m deeply grateful.”
Watching him bandage his wounds, Yun Xiu spoke slowly: “The Fourth Hall Master asked me to convey that the Divine Hall holds no deep grudge against you. The prior offences by some Hall Masters were regrettable, and we hope for your understanding. If you’re willing to turn enmity into friendship, the Fourth Hall wishes to ally with you. No matter what trouble you face, the Fourth Hall will fully support you.”
