The cloth-robed man turned to leave, but the moment he did, Chen Ping suddenly swung his sword!
The surrounding void exploded instantly, and a torrent of countless sword strikes rained down toward the man!
The cloth-robed man’s body vanished in a flash, reappearing moments later, having effortlessly dodged the barrage of sword rain!
“A sword cultivator?”
The cloth-robed man looked at Chen Ping in surprise!
“Senior, I’m an all-purpose cultivator, I can do anything!” Chen Ping grinned!
“I don’t care what kind you are, taste my sword rain…”
With that, the cloth-robed man conjured a long sword in his hand, unleashing a storm of countless sword strikes toward Chen Ping!
Chen Ping’s brows furrowed, he hadn’t expected the man to wield a sword too, and with such impressive skill!
Boom!
Chen Ping hurriedly swung his sword to counter, releasing an invincible sword intent!
In an instant, the entire world transformed into a sea of swords!
Lin Keting, along with the sisters Hong Yao and Lan Yao, quickly retreated to a safe distance!
Chen Ping’s sword intent clashed fiercely with the cloth-robed man’s in midair, sword lights arcing like rainbows, sword qi crisscrossing wildly, the entire mountain peak seemingly submerged in a sea of swords.
Their figures darted through the sword rain, moving so fast they were nearly impossible to track with the naked eye.
Chen Ping felt the man’s sword intent was exceptionally sharp, each strike carrying devastating power, as if it could tear the heavens apart.
He didn’t dare let his guard down, wielding his sword like the wind, its light flashing to form layers of sword barriers in an attempt to fend off the onslaught.
“Your swordsmanship’s decent, but it’s still far from enough!”
The cloth-robed man sneered, his long sword trembling violently, the sword light transforming into countless shadows that poured down like a torrential storm.
Chen Ping’s brows knitted tightly, he knew the man’s swordsmanship had reached an extraordinarily high level, and with his current strength, it’d be tough to hold his own.
But he didn’t back down, instead using the fight to study the man’s sword intent, searching for a flaw.
Chen Ping’s sword suddenly sped up, its light flashing like lightning, breaking through the man’s sword barrier in an instant, aiming straight for his throat.
A flicker of surprise passed through the cloth-robed man’s eyes, but he quickly regained his composure.
With a twist of his body, he easily evaded Chen Ping’s lethal strike, then countered with a swing of his sword, its light roaring like a dragon toward Chen Ping’s chest.
Chen Ping felt an overwhelming pressure, knowing that if this strike landed, he’d be dead for sure.
He didn’t dare take it head-on, retreating rapidly while vanishing from his spot in a flash, reappearing behind the cloth-robed man, his sword thrusting fiercely.
The cloth-robed man seemed to have anticipated it, dodging Chen Ping’s attack with a flicker of his form.
Then, with a backhand swing, his sword light shot out like lightning, aiming for Chen Ping’s back.
Chen Ping felt a chill, realizing he couldn’t evade this one and had no choice but to meet it head-on.
His sword trembled violently, its light morphing into a massive sword shadow that collided with the man’s sword light.
“Boom!”
The two powerful sword intents clashed midair, shaking the entire mountain peak.
Chen Ping felt a tremendous recoil, stumbling back several steps, a trickle of blood seeping from the corner of his mouth.
The cloth-robed man didn’t relent, unleashing wave after wave of sword rain like a surging tide.
Each strand of sword qi carried immense power, as if it could rip the very space apart.
Chen Ping resisted with all his might, the Dragon-Slaying Sword dancing through the dense sword rain, tracing silver arcs of light.
Every swing rang with the piercing sound of metal clashing, like war drums pounding.
“Hmph, you’ve got some skill!”
The cloth-robed man snorted coldly, his long sword shaking again, the density of the sword rain surging several times over.
Chen Ping inwardly groaned, the man’s swordsmanship wasn’t just powerful, it was unpredictable, leaving him struggling to keep up.
But the stubborn fire in his bones blazed to life, and with a roar, he shouted, “Then let’s see about that!”
“Nine Shadows Sword Technique…”
Chen Ping unleashed his signature sword skill, pouring every ounce of his spiritual energy into the blade without holding back.
