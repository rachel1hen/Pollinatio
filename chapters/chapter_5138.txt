Chen Ping smiled, looking at the middle-aged man and said, “Your entire clan has been wiped out. Whether I help or not, these storage bags will still be mine. Even if you’re all dead, can you stop me?”
The middle-aged man was stunned and speechless upon hearing this!
If they all died, everything they had would belong to Chen Ping anyway. He didn’t need to help at all.
“Help if you want, or don’t. We’re not afraid of death!”
A young man in a white robe glared at Chen Ping with great displeasure!
This young man was among the dozens of cultivators and had the cultivation level of an Eighth Grade Loose Immortal. To have such a level at such a young age showed remarkable talent!
Chen Ping glanced over. Among these dozens of cultivators, all were from the younger generation, prodigiously talented!
It seemed they were meant to preserve the spark for the Worry-Free Clan.
“Be respectful…” At this moment, a girl stepped forward, her face slightly pale but her eyes filled with composure.
“This fellow cultivator, we apologise for our rudeness. Whether you help or not is your prerogative.”
After speaking, the girl turned to the dozens of cultivators and said, “This may be the fate of our Worry-Free Clan. Accept it, and fight alongside the clan leader!”
“Let’s fight…”
The dozens of cultivators planned to join their clan leader in facing the blood-red thunder tribulation again.
The middle-aged man sighed lightly, his face full of helplessness. He had intended to preserve a spark for the clan, hoping the Worry-Free Clan could rise again in the future!
But now, it seemed the Worry-Free Clan would vanish into the river of history forever.
“Wait a moment…”
Chen Ping suddenly spoke up!
A glimmer of hope flashed in the middle-aged man’s eyes, while Hu Mazi pulled at Chen Ping and said, “Chen Ping, think carefully. This blood-red thunder tribulation is terrifying. Can you help these people withstand it?”
“Blocking the tribulation for everyone is impossible, but I can try for these few dozen cultivators!”
Chen Ping said!
“Young master, are you willing to help us?” the middle-aged man asked eagerly!
“It’s not help, it’s a transaction.” After speaking, Chen Ping stepped forward, entering the thunder tribulation zone!
Chen Ping raised his palm, and a golden light shot into the sky, forming a golden shield around him!
This golden shield enveloped all the dozens of cultivators!
Seeing this, the middle-aged man gave a faint smile, his eyes free of burdens!
Thunder tribulations came crashing down, and the protective energy the middle-aged man unleashed began to fade. All the other clan members were at their final moments!
They had no strength left and could only watch as the thunder tribulation struck, claiming lives one by one!
They had thought the collective power of their clan could resist the blood-red thunder tribulation and help their clan leader ascend to the Fourth Heaven, reaching the Earth Immortal realm.
But now, they realised they had been too naive!
At this moment, boundless energy surged within Chen Ping, sustaining the golden shield!
The thunder tribulations struck the shield but did not penetrate it!
The dozens of cultivators watched helplessly as their clan members screamed, their lives harvested by the thunder tribulation!
“What are you doing? Hurry up and save them…”
Seeing this, the white-robed youth shouted at Chen Ping!
He believed Chen Ping could save more people by expanding the shield!
Chen Ping ignored him, focusing entirely on resisting the thunder tribulation.
The girl glared at the white-robed youth and said, “Be quiet.”
The middle-aged man watched as his clan members were devoured by the thunder tribulation and finally gave up!
“Ah…”
With a furious roar, the middle-aged man’s entire body burst into flames.
“Clan leader…”
The dozens of cultivators under Chen Ping’s golden shield, witnessing this scene, all wept in anguish!
