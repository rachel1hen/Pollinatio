She subconsciously gathered her collar; a trace of indescribable embarrassment flashed between her brows.
These days, she had been inseparable from Chen Ping. The indulgence when emotions ran deep had now turned into a faint soreness and swelling at her waist; it reminded her of last night’s tenderness and madness.
Chen Ping had already noticed her unusual state. His fingertip gently brushed the stray hair from her forehead; his voice was so gentle it could drip water. “Once I’ve dealt with the matters in the Black Wind Mountain Range, I’ll return immediately.”
“You rest peacefully here. Don’t overthink things. When I return, I’ll properly massage away that blockage for you.”
Before his words finished, Ling Xue’s cheeks flushed with two red clouds; even her earlobes were tinged with a rouge-like hue.
She knew well that her cultivation was still shallow. If she followed, she would only be a burden. She could only suppress her reluctance and nod; her eyes reddened slightly, and her voice carried a hint of choking. “You… must come back safely.”
“Rest assured.” Chen Ping smiled as he ruffled the top of her hair. As he turned, the tenderness in his eyes instantly transformed into a sharp edge.
Hu Mazi was already waiting outside the courtyard. Seeing Chen Ping come out, he grinned. “Let’s go. If we’re any later, those old ghosts from the Evil Path Hall might get a few more breaths.”
The two exchanged a glance; their spiritual energy erupted suddenly. They pushed their aerial technique to the limit underfoot. Their figures turned into two streaks of flowing light shooting into the sky; they sped towards the Black Wind Mountain Range at the boundary of the Fifth Heaven.
Ling Xue stood under the corridor, watching their receding backs. She raised her hand to touch her still-hot cheek; in her heart, she silently repeated the words “safe return” over and over until the two figures completely vanished at the horizon.
The Black Wind Mountain Range was located in the most remote barren area at the edge of the Fifth Heaven. It was shrouded year-round in ink-green miasma; deep in the mountains, demonic beasts roamed freely. Even cultivators with considerable cultivation dared not venture in lightly.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi traveled at breakneck speed along the way; they urged their aerial technique to the utmost. Wind whistled in their ears; the towns and forests below retreated rapidly. In just three days, they had arrived at the periphery of the Black Wind Mountain Range.
Before stepping into the mountain range, a thick, irresolvable bloody smell assaulted them. It mixed with the stench of rotting flesh and the fishy scent of vegetation; it formed a nauseating odor.
The air was filled with faint grey-black mist; that mist contained threads of cold evil energy. It was precisely the unique aura of the Evil Path Hall cultivators.
Hu Mazi furrowed his brows tightly; his hands quickly formed a cleansing seal. A pale golden talisman emerged in his palm; it instantly turned into a light shield enveloping the two of them. It isolated the invading evil energy outside.
“Good grief, this place is more sinister than last time I came.” He smacked his lips; a trace of gravity flashed in his eyes. “It seems You Wuxie has been up to no good here. He’s probably really accomplished something.”
Chen Ping’s gaze turned cold; his right hand moved slightly. The Dragon Slaying Sword at his waist seemed to sense it and emitted a clear hum; it then unsheathed itself and hovered by his side.
The sword body circulated with faint golden light; it was as if a golden divine dragon swam within. “The more so, the more it shows their guilt.”
His voice was calm, yet it carried an unquestionable authority. “Hu Master, let’s split up to investigate. You go to the left valley; I’ll head to the right dense forest. We’ll meet back here in half an hour.”
“Got it.”
Hu Mazi responded; his figure flickered. In his hand, three yellow talismans appeared; the talismans were drawn with complex runes in vermilion. They emitted faint spiritual light.
He tossed the talismans into the air; he muttered incantations. The talismans instantly turned into three yellow streams of light; they trailed long tails as they rushed into the miasma-filled mountains. He himself followed closely; his figure soon disappeared into the dense fog.
Chen Ping took a deep breath; the divine dragon power within him operated quietly. Golden scales began to spread from his wrists; they soon covered both arms. A faint golden halo encircled his body; it forced the surrounding miasma back three feet.
