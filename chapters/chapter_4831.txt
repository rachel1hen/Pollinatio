Chen Ping didn’t respond, instead focusing on the seal, his fingers tracing something in the air!
Soon, divine runes appeared at his fingertips, quickly forming a seal that was identical to the prisoner’s mark on the ground!
The man’s eyes widened in shock, his face full of disbelief!
At that moment, the seal Chen Ping had drawn erupted with a powerful suction force!
The blood within the crimson seal on the ground began rapidly flowing into Chen Ping’s seal!
In just a few moments, the ground’s prisoner’s mark lost all its color, and with a light stomp from Chen Ping, the seal shattered with a boom!
At the same time, the man felt the prisoner’s mark within his body vanish instantly, though a different seal appeared in its place!
“You’re free now, the seal in your body is one I created, so it won’t restrict you.”
“But if you go back on your word or turn against me, this seal will activate.”
Chen Ping said to the man!
One mustn’t harbor intent to harm, but one must always guard against others…
The man stared at Chen Ping in a daze, then dropped to one knee, “I, Nan Batian, swear to follow my master to the death…”
“Nan Batian, nice name!”
Chen Ping nodded, “My name’s Chen Ping, just call me Mr. Chen!”
As Chen Ping was feeling smug, a sudden tremor shook the heavens and earth, followed by a mysterious force surging toward him!
Seeing this, Nan Batian bolted away in fright, shouting, “That’s the Power of the Heavenly Dao, you broke the prisoner’s mark without permission, you’ve triggered divine retribution…”
“Damn it, why didn’t you say so earlier, only now you tell me!”
Chen Ping glared at Nan Batian, fuming!
“Sorry, I forgot…”
Nan Batian said!
Chen Ping knew this guy did it on purpose, how could he forget something like that, he deliberately kept it from him!
Chen Ping’s expression shifted drastically as he gripped the Dragon-Slaying Sword, slashing out waves of sword qi to block the Power of the Heavenly Dao!
But the sword qi he unleashed disintegrated the moment it touched the Heavenly Dao’s power, utterly unable to resist!
“It’s over, it’s over…” Seeing this, Chen Ping’s heart sank into despair!
Why did he have to meddle, now he’d brought divine retribution upon himself!
“Scared of what, this is just the Heavenly Dao power of a Golden Immortal, what’s there to fear?”
“If I had my physical body back, forget this puny Heavenly Dao power, I’d drag that Golden Immortal out and give him a beating!”
Seeing Chen Ping lose his fighting spirit, the Red Cloud Demon Lord bellowed!
“Senior, you might not be afraid, but I am, I’m not even at the Immortal Transformation Realm yet, and you think I can withstand a Golden Immortal’s Heavenly Dao power?”
Chen Ping said helplessly.
“Fair point, you’re too weak…” The Red Cloud Demon Lord frowned slightly!
As the Power of the Heavenly Dao was about to engulf Chen Ping, his storage ring trembled, and the little Heaven-Devouring Beast slowly emerged, opening its mouth with a yawn!
The terrifying Heavenly Dao power was instantly sucked into the beast’s belly!
Then the little Heaven-Devouring Beast returned to the storage ring, all in the span of a single breath, the fearsome divine retribution was gone!
Witnessing this, Nan Batian was dumbfounded, “This… this is…”
“This is just one of my little pets, dealing with this kind of Heavenly Dao power, why would I need to lift a finger…”
Chen Ping put on an air of profound mystery, then asked, “Were you just trying to trick me, hoping I’d get struck down by the retribution…”
“No way, I’d never dare…”
Nan Batian was terrified, dropping to his knees before Chen Ping, “I really forgot, this prisoner’s mark has tormented me so much my memory’s shot!”
“Fine, I’ll let it slide this once, get up!” Chen Ping waved a hand!
Nan Batian stood, his massive frame trailing behind Chen Ping!
“Can you shrink a bit? This hundred-meter height makes talking to you a chore!”
Chen Ping tilted his head back to look at Nan Batian and asked!
“Of course I can, this isn’t my real form!” Nan Batian said, his body instantly reverting to a normal human size, then he grinned, “I just wanted to intimidate people, give myself a bit of bravado!”
