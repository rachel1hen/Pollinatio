A muffled thunderous roar resounded within Chen Ping’s body, the barrier of the sixth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm cracking like a dam battered by floodwaters.
He quickly sat cross-legged, guiding the sudden surge of energy to assault the barrier.
Hu Mazi, under the influence of the Green Lotus, regained his senses. Seeing the golden halo swirling around Chen Ping, his eyes widened in shock, “Is, is he about to break through?”
At that moment, the Crimson Fairy arrived with her pursuers. Seeing Chen Ping in the midst of a breakthrough, a sinister smile spread across her face, “The heavens are on my side! Today, both of you will perish in this Bone-Rotting Marsh!”
Several crimson whip shadows lashed towards Chen Ping like venomous snakes. Without hesitation, Hu Mazi threw himself in front of Chen Ping, shielding him with his body.
Just as the whip shadows were about to strike, Chen Ping’s eyes snapped open, the aura of the seventh rank of the Loose Immortal Realm erupting like a tsunami!
“Get lost!”
With a furious shout, golden sword qi formed a circular barrier, shattering the Crimson Fairy’s whip shadows completely.
In a flash, Chen Ping appeared before her, his Dragon-Slaying Sword thrusting towards her heart with the force to tear through the void.
The Crimson Fairy’s face paled in terror. She hadn’t expected Chen Ping to break through in such an environment, let alone with such a rapid increase in strength.
In a panic, she summoned her natal treasure, the Crimson Snake Shield, to defend herself, but the sword qi forced her back, blood trickling from her mouth.
“How, how could your realm improve so quickly?” she stammered, shocked and enraged.
Who breaks through a realm at such speed?
Even a minor breakthrough requires time and a safe environment.
For Chen Ping to achieve it in this setting, in the blink of an eye, was utterly absurd.
Chen Ping didn’t answer, only staring at her coldly.
The power of the seventh rank of the Loose Immortal Realm filled him with confidence, his spiritual energy flowing freely, nourished by the energy of the Pure World Green Lotus.
He could feel that his current strength was enough to contend with a fourth-rank Earth Immortal cultivator.
“Too tough, retreat!”
The Crimson Fairy, realizing the situation was hopeless, decisively ordered a withdrawal.
With a reluctant glance at Chen Ping, she turned and fled with her followers into the depths of the marsh.
As the pursuers departed, Chen Ping let out a sigh of relief, collapsing onto a black rock.
Hu Mazi rushed to support him, “Are you alright?”
“I’m fine.”
Chen Ping smiled, shaking his head, feeling the surging power within, “Thanks to the Pure World Green Lotus, it not only detoxified me but also helped me break through.”
He stood, gazing deeper into the marsh, “We shouldn’t stay here long. Let’s cross the Bone-Rotting Marsh quickly.”
After a brief rest, the two continued their journey. Bolstered by the energy of the Pure World Green Lotus, they moved through the marsh much faster.
They encountered several dangerous traps and poisonous creatures along the way, but Chen Ping’s overwhelming strength neutralized them all.
Hours later, Chen Ping and Hu Mazi finally reached the exit of the Bone-Rotting Marsh.
It was a lush forest, a stark contrast to the marsh’s eerie dread, bathed in bright sunlight and teeming with life.
“We made it!” Hu Mazi shouted excitedly, running towards the forest.
Chen Ping exhaled in relief, about to follow, when he noticed something glinting in the mud at the marsh’s edge.
Curious, he approached and found a palm-sized black token engraved with a sinister skull pattern.
“Is this a token of the Evil Path Hall?”
Chen Ping frowned. He had seen similar tokens in the Third Heaven. Had the Evil Path Hall been here too?
He pocketed the token, a sense of unease rising within him.
The destruction of the Hu Clan might be tied to the Evil Path Hall, and this matter seemed far more complicated than he had imagined.
