He looked at the menacing snake demons surrounding him, a flicker of despair in his eyes. Was this where he would die today?
At that moment, a rustle came from the grass, and the clan leader’s token emitted a dazzling white light, enveloping the surrounding snake demons.
Upon contact with the light, the snake demons let out agonised screams, black smoke rising from their bodies, clearly in immense pain. The demon pinning Hu Mazi’s chest was no exception, shrieking as it staggered back.
Hu Mazi seized the chance to struggle to his feet, picking up the clan leader’s token and staring at it in astonishment.
He hadn’t expected the token to possess such power, capable of subduing snake demons.
“What is that thing?”
The lead snake demon eyed the token warily, “All together now, I refuse to believe we can’t take him down!”
The snake demons, enduring the pain from the white light, closed in on Hu Mazi again.
Hu Mazi gripped the token tightly, channelling his remaining spiritual energy into it. The white light grew brighter, forming a sturdy barrier that kept the demons at bay.
But his spiritual energy was nearly gone, the light’s intensity fading, and cracks began to appear in the barrier.
“Hahaha… he’s almost done for!”
The snake demons, seeing this, grew more excited, their attacks intensifying.
Just as the barrier was about to shatter, a golden sword aura sliced through like a celestial strike, instantly sending several demons flying.
“Chen Ping!” Hu Mazi shouted in joy.
Chen Ping appeared before him, wielding the Dragon-Slaying Sword, standing protectively in front.
“I’m late.”
“Why did you come back?” Hu Mazi asked, surprised, thinking Chen Ping had already escaped.
“I said we’d leave together, so we will,” Chen Ping said with a faint smile, “Leave these small fry to me, you recover.”
No sooner had he spoken than he charged at the snake demons with the Dragon-Slaying Sword.
Golden sword aura rained down like a storm, the demons no match, falling with screams.
The lead demon, terrified, turned to flee.
Chen Ping gave him no chance, flashing forward and slaying him with a single swing of the sword.
After dealing with the demons, Chen Ping approached Hu Mazi, handing him a healing pill: “How are you? Can you walk?”
Hu Mazi swallowed the pill and nodded: “I’m alright.”
“We need to leave Snake Coiling Mountain fast, Fairy Chi Lian will catch up soon,” Chen Ping said.
Supporting each other, they fled towards the mountain’s edge.
As Chen Ping predicted, Fairy Chi Lian soon learned of her subordinates’ deaths, furious, and led a large group of experts in pursuit.
“Search! Even if you have to dig three feet deep, find them!”
Her voice echoed through Snake Coiling Mountain, brimming with rage.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi struggled through the dense forest, the pursuers closing in, Fairy Chi Lian’s aura hounding them like a persistent curse.
“This won’t work, we’ll be caught eventually,” Hu Mazi said, gasping, “Fairy Chi Lian’s strength is too great, we’re no match.”
Chen Ping’s brows furrowed, knowing Hu Mazi was right but unable to think of a better plan.
At that moment, a swamp appeared ahead, black bubbles rising from it, emitting a pungent stench, looking extremely dangerous.
“This is… Bone-Rotting Swamp!” Hu Mazi recognised it, “Ancient texts say it’s filled with deadly poison and traps. Once you fall in, you’re corroded to bones, even Earth Immortal cultivators dare not approach lightly.”
Chen Ping glanced at the nearing pursuers, a resolute glint in his eyes: “We go through here!”
