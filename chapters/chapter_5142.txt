This casual display of breaking the formation made Elder Zhao’s expression change instantly.
He could tell that Chen Ping’s single finger used minimal spiritual energy, relying purely on his unparalleled physical strength and soul pressure.
“A sanctified body? Are you from the Barbaric Ancient Clan?”
Elder Zhao’s voice carried a trace of shock and doubt.
He recognised that Chen Ping’s physical prowess stemmed entirely from the Barbaric Ancient Clan’s Barbaric Body Refining Technique.
The Barbaric Ancient Clan had no enmity with their Tianyan Sect, even sharing some connections!
He couldn’t understand why Chen Ping, as a member of the Barbaric Ancient Clan, would come to cause trouble at the Tianyan Sect!
“The Barbaric Ancient Clan?”
Chen Ping’s lips curled into a mocking smirk, “There will no longer be a Barbaric Ancient Clan in this Third Heaven.”
“What do you mean by that?” Elder Zhao asked, puzzled!
“Nothing special, just the literal meaning.”
Chen Ping smiled faintly!
“Did you destroy the Barbaric Ancient Clan?” Elder Zhao’s brows furrowed slightly!
“Exactly!” Chen Ping nodded!
“Elder Zhao, don’t listen to his nonsense, what strength does he have to destroy the Barbaric Ancient Clan? Even if our Tianyan Sect made a move, wiping out the Barbaric Ancient Clan would take some effort.”
The formation-setting elder snorted coldly!
Though Chen Ping had broken his formation, that didn’t mean Chen Ping had the strength to annihilate the Barbaric Ancient Clan!
“You don’t believe me?” Chen Ping asked, looking at the elder!
“Of course not, with your calibre, you think you can destroy the Barbaric Ancient Clan, I…”
Before the elder could finish, a flash of golden light streaked before his eyes!
No one had time to react, only to see Chen Ping holding the Dragon-Slaying Sword, already unleashing a sword qi.
The elder’s eyes widened, watching helplessly as his body was cleaved in two, collapsing heavily to the ground.
“Bold, you dare kill our Tianyan Sect elder…”
The others, seeing this, all prepared to attack Chen Ping!
But Elder Zhao hurriedly intervened, “Everyone, don’t act rashly!”
Chen Ping could effortlessly kill one of their elders right in front of them, showing his strength was far beyond what they could handle!
This Elder Zhao still had some sense, stopping the others, or they might all have died.
“Why do you keep killing our Tianyan Sect disciples? What is your purpose? We seem to have no enmity, do we?”
Elder Zhao wanted to understand why Chen Ping kept targeting the Tianyan Sect!
“Because of him…”
Chen Ping casually tossed out the head of Xuanzhi, the Tianyan Sect’s leader!
“Sect Master…” Seeing Xuanzhi’s head, all the Tianyan Sect disciples were utterly shocked!
Their sect master, a ninth-rank Loose Immortal Realm cultivator, how could he be killed so easily?
“Your sect master, along with the Barbaric Ancient Clan and the Blood Shadow Palace, attacked me, trying to seize the ancient relic treasure I possess, but their skills were inferior, and I killed all three!”
“Since they could come to steal my belongings, can’t I come to destroy their sect?”
Chen Ping said calmly!
Elder Zhao’s face was now ashen, the Barbaric Ancient Clan, the Blood Shadow Palace, and their Tianyan Sect, three ninth-rank Loose Immortal Realm cultivators, were no match for Chen Ping, his fearsome power was unimaginable.
He knew that with their strength, they had no chance of stopping Chen Ping!
“Summon the old sect master…”
Elder Zhao suddenly released a burst of aura, which instantly sank into Tianyan Peak!
“Rumble…”
With a tremor shaking the earth, the entire mountain peak slowly split apart!
Soon, a terrifying aura erupted from within Tianyan Peak, a golden rainbow light streaking across the sky, landing instantly before Chen Ping.
The figure was an elder, clad in a nine-dragon purple robe, wearing a purple-gold crown, Ling Yunxiao, the old sect master of the Tianyan Sect, with a peak ninth-rank Loose Immortal Realm cultivation.
