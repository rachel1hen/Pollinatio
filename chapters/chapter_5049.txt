“Could these coffins be formed from blood?”
Chen Ping, upon closer inspection, was utterly shocked.
The coffins reeked of blood, and the peculiar symbols on them moved slowly, like leaves drifting in a river.
Around the coffins, a mysterious energy continuously seeped inward, as if being absorbed by something inside.
Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun carefully examined the three coffins, finding them extraordinarily strange.
As the two stood motionless, Tianci grew restless.
He thought they might have discovered something but didn’t dare approach himself.
“You go check,” Tianci said to the man in green.
The man in green frowned, “Why don’t you go?”
“If you don’t go, I’ll kill you. Choose between death and going to check,” Tianci said to the man in green.
The man’s face turned grim, seething with anger, but it was no use.
He was no match for Tianci, and even if he could fight him, Elder Tong was there, and he couldn’t escape alone.
After much hesitation, the man in green reluctantly started walking. After a couple of steps, he glanced back at the woman in white.
His eyes were full of a plea for help, but the woman in white acted as if she didn’t see.
In this world, the weak received no sympathy.
To earn respect, there was no other way but to become strong.
It was the only path.
With no choice, the man in green slowly approached Chen Ping and the others.
At that moment, Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun were still engrossed in the three coffins, completely unaware of the man in green.
Though Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun had passed safely, the man in green remained extremely cautious.
As he reached the front of the stone platform, he instinctively glanced at the warrior statues on either side.
At that moment, the statues’ eyes seemed to be fixed on Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun. After a quick look, the man in green stepped onto the platform.
But the moment he did, a sudden gust of wind struck. The man in green, startled, quickly raised his blade to defend.
In that instant, the two warrior statues seemed to come alive, their large blades slashing towards him in unison.
Boom!
In a flash, the man in green was sent flying, crashing heavily at the feet of Tianci and the others.
The blade in his hand shattered into pieces, and his entire arm hung limply.
With a single strike, the man in green was crippled.
His weapon was gone, his arm useless…
Everyone was stunned, even Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun couldn’t help but turn to look back.
When they saw it was the two warrior statues that had attacked, Chen Ping’s expression grew grave. He had already sensed something eerie about these statues.
The man in green was a fifth-grade Tribulation Realm cultivator—how could he be taken out with one hit?
The strength of these warrior statues was terrifying.
Chen Ping gripped his Dragon-Slaying Sword, now on high alert, and Mo Qingyun didn’t dare let her guard down either. She hadn’t expected the statues to actually attack.
But after Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun waited for a while, the two warrior statues only stared at them with their eyes, showing no sign of attacking.
The man in green slowly stood, his eyes filled with rage. He was baffled—why had he been attacked when he followed the same path as Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun, who were unharmed?
Tianci and the others were equally puzzled, unable to make sense of it.
“Elder Tong, do you know why this happened?” Tianci asked.
Elder Tong shook his head, “There’s no formation on those statues, nor are they controlled by anyone. I can’t figure out why they suddenly attacked.”
