“Mr. Chen, it’s not me looking for you, it’s Qingyun looking for you!” Blue Lotus glanced at Mo Qingyun and said.
Mo Qingyun looked at Chen Ping, her eyes filled with reluctance, her expression slightly pained as she said, “Chen Ping, I have to go back, my family has started urging me.”
“After Tianci returned, he had Tianyuan Pavilion put pressure on the Mo family, now I must go back, otherwise my parents will suffer.”
Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Chen Ping frowned slightly, then said, “I’ll go back with you, I want to see what’s so great about this Tianyuan Pavilion.”
“No, Tianyuan Pavilion is very powerful, you don’t need to get involved, I’m already content having met you during this time.” Mo Qingyun shook her head.
“I said I’d go back with you, so we’ll go together, I’ll handle things, you don’t need to worry.” Chen Ping said with strong determination!
Mo Qingyun, rather than being put off, quite enjoyed Chen Ping’s assertiveness.
“I’ll make some arrangements, then we’ll leave!” Chen Ping said before departing.
Blue Lotus looked at Mo Qingyun with envy and said, “Qingyun, Mr. Chen is so good to you, meeting a domineering man like him is your fortune.”
“Don’t worry about how many women he has, as long as he’s yours too, finding a good man these days is too hard…”
Blue Lotus’s envy made Mo Qingyun feel delighted, and she nodded vigorously, agreeing with what Blue Lotus said.
Chen Ping left the hall and directly sought out Huo Zhao, who had just emerged from the Demon-Suppressing Tower, fully recovered.
“Son-in-law, with this treasure, you’ll achieve great things in the future.”
Seeing Chen Ping, Huo Zhao praised loudly.
While others toil for a year of cultivation, Chen Ping could achieve a century’s worth.
“Father-in-law, you’ve recovered, what’s your next plan?” Chen Ping asked.
“I’ll follow your lead, you’re now the master of the Eight Halls.” Huo Zhao said.
“I plan to go to the Second Heaven.” Chen Ping stated.
“Then let’s go to the Second Heaven, the Eight Halls’ residence is there too, now that I’m healed, it’s time to return!” Huo Zhao nodded.
Soon, Chen Ping, along with Hu Mazi, Mo Qingyun, and the Eight Halls’ members, left Cangxuan Continent, heading for the Second Heaven.
Before leaving, Chen Ping gave Blue Lotus a portrait, asking her to search for the person in the First Heaven.
The portrait was of Su Yuqi, and since being brought here, Chen Ping had no idea where she had been sent.
Now, he could only rely on Blue Lotus’s influence to search.
As Chen Ping and his group headed to the Second Heaven, a storm was brewing within the Divine Hall!
In the Divine King Palace, inside a majestic golden hall.
*Bang!*
An old man in a golden robe slammed the table angrily, shouting, “The Patrol Envoy was killed, the Eight Halls have rebelled, and that old fool Huo Zhao dares to side with outsiders!”
“Third Hall Master, calm down!” a middle-aged man stepped forward, saying gravely, “This matter may not be so simple.”
“That Chen Ping can control ancient battle puppets, his strength is likely at the peak of the Loose Immortal Realm, or… even higher!”
The golden-robed old man snorted coldly, “A mere Loose Immortal dares to challenge the Divine Hall’s authority?”
“Pass my order, tell the Seventh Hall Master to flatten Cangxuan Continent, kill Chen Ping, and wipe out the entire Eight Halls!”
“No!”
Suddenly, a clear, cold female voice rang out.
Everyone turned to see a stunning woman in a white dress slowly entering the hall.
Her face was cold, her eyes like snow, exuding a chilling aura.
“Fourth Hall Master, what do you mean by this?” the golden-robed old man frowned.
The Fourth Hall Master said calmly, “Third Hall Master, the Divine Hall is currently plagued by internal and external troubles, it’s not wise to act rashly.”
“Moreover, Chen Ping’s ability to control ancient battle puppets suggests there’s more to this.”
“If we act recklessly, it could lead to unforeseen consequences.”
The golden-robed old man sneered, “Fourth Hall Master, are you trying to protect that outsider boy?”
“Or have you also fallen for him, wanting to consort with an outsider man?”
