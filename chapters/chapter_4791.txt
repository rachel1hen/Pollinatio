Chen Ping stood up and saw two figures approaching him, both women dressed in flowing white skirts, strikingly beautiful, and most notably, their faces were nearly identical, differing only in the butterfly hairpins they wore—one blue, one red!
Twins…
Chen Ping could tell at a glance, they were twins!
The woman with the blue hairpin stepped forward, smiling faintly, “Fellow Daoist, is this your first time in the Lawless Land?”
“How’d you know?”
Chen Ping asked!
“From that excited look you had just now, it’s obvious it’s your first visit, my sister and I were the same way when we first came.”
“This place is absolutely stunning, such a pity there’s no spiritual energy, no cultivation resources at all, staying here long-term would stall your cultivation!”
The blue hairpin woman said!
“What’s cultivation even for? If you could live a simple life here with the woman you love, that’d be pretty nice too,” Chen Ping mused!
“Cultivation’s for becoming an immortal, of course…” the red hairpin woman chimed in!
“And after becoming an immortal?” Chen Ping pressed!
“Then you keep cultivating, to become a High Immortal, Golden Immortal, Celestial Immortal, Immortal Lord, Immortal Emperor…”
The red hairpin woman’s eyes sparkled with longing as she spoke!
“Even if you become the supreme ruler, the master of heaven and earth, then what?”
“Watching countless stars every day, living alone, for ten thousand years, a billion years, or even forever?”
Chen Ping asked!
“This…” The red hairpin woman froze!
She’d never thought about it, in her mind, it was just cultivate, keep climbing to higher realms!
As for why cultivate, or what happens after mastering the cosmos, she’d never considered it!
Chen Ping’s sudden question threw her mind into chaos!
“Fellow Daoist, people have different goals, so their perspectives differ, maybe to you, a quiet life with your beloved is ideal!”
“But some think cultivating to eternal life is perfection, different aims, no right or wrong, let’s not dwell on this.”
“Since you’re in the Lawless Land, Fellow Daoist, you must be here for the Heaven Ladder, right?”
The blue hairpin woman cut off Chen Ping’s train of thought!
If this kept up, her sister’s head might explode!
“Yeah, I want to check out the Heaven Ladder…” Chen Ping nodded!
“For a little Third-Grade Mahayana Realm cultivator like you to dare enter the Lawless Land, that’s rare, and even fewer would dare take on the Heaven Ladder.”
“You’re the gutsiest cultivator I’ve seen in years, Third-Grade Mahayana Realm and aiming for the ladder!”
“Your courage is downright impressive…”
The blue hairpin woman showered Chen Ping with praise, thumbs up all the way!
But as Chen Ping listened to her flattery, he started getting wary!
No one’s this nice without an angle…
“You need something from me?”
Chen Ping asked cautiously!
“No, no!” The blue hairpin woman shook her head, “I’m just admiring your guts, but in the Lawless Land, guts alone won’t cut it for the Heaven Ladder.”
“The ladder itself isn’t the biggest threat here, it’s the cultivators who come, they see your realm so low, they’d snuff you out in a snap.”
“You’ve got to hide your aura, keep others from sensing your true strength, that way they won’t dare mess with you lightly, and you can roam the Lawless Land freely!”
“Hide my aura, that…”
