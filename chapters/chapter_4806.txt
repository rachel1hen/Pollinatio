Qian Sect!
In the grand hall, Sect Leader Qian Xiaohan presided in person, all members of the Qian Sect gathered within!
“Third Elder is dead, slain by a single sword strike…”
Qian Xiaohan said slowly!
“What? Third Elder was a third-grade Transcendent Immortal, skilled in the art of heavenly divination, how could he be killed with one strike?”
“No way, we all know Third Elder’s strength!”
“Third Elder went to Wuwang Land, who’d dare touch our Qian Sect there?”
The Qian Sect members, hearing this, all reacted with disbelief!
“Sect Leader, was Third Elder’s death reported by someone, or did you deduce it through divination?”
At that moment, the Great Elder stood and asked Qian Xiaohan!
“Known through divination, but news will come soon…”
No sooner had Qian Xiaohan finished speaking than a Qian Sect cultivator rushed in!
“Reporting to the Sect Leader, Third Elder was killed in the Dao Sect of Wuwang Land with a single sword strike, reduced to a pile of mush, not even a body left behind.”
The Qian Sect cultivator said in a panic!
*Boom…*
The revelation jolted everyone, prompting them to leap to their feet.
“Speak, who did it?”
“One strike turned Third Elder to mush, who’s got that kind of skill?”
“How’s that possible? In the entire Celestial Realm, fewer than ten could pull that off!”
All the Qian Sect cultivators found it unthinkable, unbelievable!
“It was a man named Chen Ping, he’s the one who killed Third Elder!”
The messenger cultivator announced!
“Chen Ping?” Everyone frowned slightly.
“I know, this Chen Ping’s the one the Huo family put a 200,000 immortal spirit stone bounty on, anyone worth that price from the Huo family must be strong!”
Someone recalled and spoke up!
“This Chen Ping’s only at third-grade Mahayana!” the messenger cultivator added!
“You’re talking nonsense, a third-grade Mahayana, how could he possibly kill Third Elder with one strike?”
“You’re talking nonsense, a third-grade Mahayana, how could he possibly kill Third Elder with one strike?”
The Great Elder roared in a fury!
The messenger cultivator trembled in fear, “Great Elder, Chen Ping really is just third-grade Mahayana, I wouldn’t dare lie!”
At that, silence fell over everyone!
They simply couldn’t wrap their heads around how a third-grade Mahayana cultivator could kill a third-grade Transcendent Immortal with one strike!
“Stand down…” Qian Xiaohan waved a hand, dismissing the messenger!
“Sect Leader, a third-grade Mahayana killed Third Elder with one strike, do you believe that?”
The Great Elder, still incredulous, asked!
“Why wouldn’t I? It’s the truth!”
Qian Xiaohan replied, then with a gentle wave of his hand, a halo of light appeared before them.
Within that halo, the scene of Chen Ping slaying Third Elder with one strike played out!
Seeing the footage, no one dared question it anymore!
Chen Ping’s strike was plain and unremarkable, painfully slow even!
Yet Third Elder seemed oblivious to dodging, his eyes filled with nothing but terror!
“What, what’s going on here? Is this Chen Ping some kind of freak?”
The Great Elder said, his face full of disbelief!
“Great Elder, a third-grade Mahayana killing a third-grade Transcendent Immortal with one strike, do you believe it?”
Qian Xiaohan asked!
The Great Elder stayed silent, only nodding!
The evidence was right there, he had no choice but to believe, yet it was just too outrageous!
“I don’t believe it!”
Qian Xiaohan suddenly declared!
The crowd turned to Qian Xiaohan in confusion, unsure why he’d abruptly changed his tune!
“Didn’t any of you notice that when Chen Ping made his move, there was a subtle shift in his aura?”
Qian Xiaohan asked!
They scrutinized the scene again, then shook their heads, after all, it was just an image, they couldn’t be there in person to feel Chen Ping’s aura!
