In the Land of No Return, Chen Ping was still immersed in a selfless state!
He had no certainty about when this Heaven and Earth Array could be broken!
Lin Chong, Wuji Daoist, the Five Domain Lords, Nan Batian, Li Chunfeng, Shen Zhiyan, Mu Sha, and the others were all guarding Chen Ping!
At that moment, from the horizon of the Land of No Return, waves of terrifying auras were rapidly approaching!
Feeling that fearsome presence, everyone’s expressions turned grave!
In the span of a breath, Wen Nanxing, leading the Fire Incineration Sect members, appeared before Lin Chong and the others!
Wen Nanxing glanced up at Chen Ping, lost in the Heaven and Earth Array, his eyes glinting with icy killing intent!
“Wen Nanxing? What are you doing here?”
Seeing it was the Fire Incineration Sect, Lin Chong’s expression grew flustered!
The Four Nether Mansions alone had given them a tough time, and now with the arrival of the Celestial Realm’s top power, the Fire Incineration Sect, Lin Chong’s heart sank even further!
“The Heaven and Earth Array can’t be broken yet, so the one breaking it must die!”
Wen Nanxing said coldly!
Lin Chong didn’t respond, instead casting a glance at Wuji Daoist!
With a flick of his whisk, Wuji Daoist nodded!
“Kill…”
Lin Chong roared, charging forward first!
In an instant, everyone below Chen Ping surged into action!
Without any extra words, the sky darkened, and all sorts of techniques flew through the air!
Wen Nanxing didn’t move, his eyes locked on Chen Ping!
With a slight point of his finger toward Chen Ping, a surge of energy shot straight at him!
“Protect Mr. Chen…”
Seeing this, Lin Chong bellowed!
But at that moment, everyone was tangled up with the Fire Incineration Sect members, unable to break free!
Besides, not everyone could withstand a single strike from Wen Nanxing!
As the leader of the Celestial Realm’s top power, Wen Nanxing’s strength was terrifying, having reached the peak of the Immortal Transformation Realm, on the verge of ascending to the Heavenly Realm at any moment!
Just as the energy reached Chen Ping, he seemed completely unaware, his eyes still slightly closed, immersed in the Heaven and Earth Array!
Suddenly, a large hand grabbed the energy mid-air, squeezing it lightly!
Boom!
The energy exploded instantly, unleashing a terrifying shockwave that knocked back everyone fighting, halting the battle!
A single shockwave repelled everyone, its horrifying power leaving them all in disbelief!
Before Chen Ping stood Mu Sha, gaunt and pale-faced!
Wen Nanxing looked at Mu Sha, his expression turning extremely solemn, this man gave him a sense of danger, shocking him deeply, he couldn’t understand how such a master could appear in the Celestial Realm’s Land of No Return!
In the Celestial Realm, he considered himself invincible, so who was this sudden newcomer?
“Who are you?” Wen Nanxing asked!
“You’re not worthy of knowing!” Mu Sha replied faintly!
“Hmph, even if you’re a Heavenly Realm cultivator, in this Celestial Realm, you’d better behave, dragon or tiger, you’ll bow to me, I’m the invincible one here.”
Wen Nanxing snorted coldly, drawing a line in the void with his hand, conjuring a massive cage before everyone!
“Do you dare to fight?”
Wen Nanxing asked!
“Why wouldn’t I dare!” Mu Sha stepped into the giant cage without hesitation!
Only this way could their battle avoid affecting others, otherwise, a clash between the two of them might destroy the entire Land of No Return, killing everyone around!
Wen Nanxing sneered and stepped into the cage, then slowly opened his right hand, a brilliant light radiating from his palm, causing the entire Land of No Return to tremble violently!
“Child’s play!” Mu Sha snorted, throwing a punch!
Boom!
In an instant, countless streams of the Great Dao’s power surged from Mu Sha’s body, as an immortal from the Heavenly Realm, his combat experience and techniques far surpassed anything Wen Nanxing could match!
