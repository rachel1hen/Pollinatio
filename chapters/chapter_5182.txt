The ghostly shadows were grotesque, radiating intense resentment and malevolent energy, making the air thick and viscous wherever they passed.
“Nether Ghost Claw!”
You Wuxie formed a claw with his fingers, swiping through the air towards Chen Ping. A massive black ghost claw materialized out of nowhere, tearing through space as it lunged at him.
Chen Ping’s expression grew solemn, not daring to be careless. He could sense that You Wuxie’s strength far surpassed that of the Eight Consecrators and Twelve Blood Guards, having truly reached the Earth Immortal Realm.
“Break!”
Chen Ping let out a low shout, the Dragon-Slaying Sword erupting with unprecedented brilliance. A golden sword aura roared forth like an enraged dragon, colliding with the black ghost claw.
“Boom!”
The golden sword aura and black ghost claw shattered simultaneously, the powerful shockwave levelling the entire plaza. The Seventh Hall’s protective mountain array collapsed under the impact, tiles from the hall raining down.
Chen Ping was forced back several steps, his blood churning, a trickle of it spilling from the corner of his mouth. You Wuxie fared no better, pushed back a hundred metres, his face beneath the black robe growing even darker.
“Interesting.”
You Wuxie licked his lips, a flicker of excitement in his eyes, “It’s been a long time since I’ve met a Loose Immortal Realm cultivator who could withstand one of my moves. Kid, you’re worthy of my full effort.”
“Nether Great Law, Ten Thousand Ghosts Devour Soul!”
You Wuxie formed hand seals, and the nine soul banners trembled violently. Countless ghostly shadows surged forth like a tide, forming a massive ghost array that trapped Chen Ping within.
The ghosts let out piercing shrieks, lunging towards Chen Ping, intent on devouring his soul.
Chen Ping took a deep breath, circulating his spiritual energy while summoning his soul power.
A faint light glowed at his brow, and a powerful soul pressure radiated outward, instantly shattering many of the oncoming ghosts.
“Slash!”
Chen Ping let out a long roar, the golden sword aura on the Dragon-Slaying Sword transforming into a massive golden dragon.
The golden dragon roared as it charged, clashing with the ghostly shadows. Its majestic dragon aura intimidated the ghosts, each collision tearing through swathes of them.
Seeing this, a hint of surprise flashed in You Wuxie’s eyes, “Soul power? Not only is your cultivation peculiar, but you also possess such formidable soul power. Unfortunately, in my Ten Thousand Ghosts Devour Soul Array, your soul power will eventually be exhausted.”
You Wuxie’s hands moved rapidly through seals, the faces on the nine soul banners roaring with increased frenzy. The ghostly shadows surged like an endless tide, wave after wave rushing towards Chen Ping.
Chen Ping gritted his teeth, relentlessly swinging the Dragon-Slaying Sword. The golden dragon, under his control, fought desperately against the ghosts.
His breathing grew slightly erratic, but his gaze became ever more resolute.
“Kid, give up! You can’t beat me!”
You Wuxie’s voice echoed through the ghost array, laced with a hint of temptation, “Hand over the token and submit to me, and I’ll spare your life. I can even recommend you to join the Evil Path Hall, and your future achievements will be limitless.”
“Enough nonsense!” Chen Ping roared, “If you want the token, come and take it with your own strength!”
“Stubborn fool!” A glint of killing intent flashed in You Wuxie’s eyes, “Since you refuse the toast and choose the punishment, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”
“Nine Nether Soul Fire!”
You Wuxie flicked his finger, and the nine soul banners ignited with eerie blue flames. The flames, as if alive, drifted towards Chen Ping. Wherever they passed, the air itself caught fire, sizzling ominously.
Chen Ping could sense the terrifying power within these blue flames; if they touched him, they would likely burn his soul to ashes.
“Dragon Soars to the Heavens!”
Chen Ping leapt into the air, the golden sword aura on the Dragon-Slaying Sword transforming into a golden flying dragon, charging towards the blue flames with a piercing sonic boom.
The golden dragon collided with the blue flames, erupting in dazzling light. The flames were torn apart by the dragon, but the dragon itself was consumed by the flames, growing smaller until it vanished completely.
