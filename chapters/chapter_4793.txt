“Tang Xiaoyi?”
Seeing this young man, the two women’s expressions shifted slightly!
“Hongyao, Lanyao, are you two sisters blind or something? Ignoring a fat bounty just to peddle your lousy talismans?”
Tang Xiaoyi fanned himself, his face dripping with disdain!
“Young Master Tang, what do you mean?”
Hongyao asked!
“You don’t know this guy?” Tang Xiaoyi shot back!
Hongyao and Lanyao shook their heads, they didn’t know Chen Ping, just saw his low realm and unfamiliar face, figuring he’d be an easy mark for their concealment talismans!
“No wonder!” Tang Xiaoyi smirked, “This guy’s Chen Ping, the Huo family’s got a twenty-thousand immortal spirit stone bounty on his head.”
“Twenty thousand immortal spirit stones?”
Hongyao and Lanyao exchanged a glance, eyes wide with shock!
“Young Master Tang, you’re not joking, right? A Third-Grade Mahayana Realm cultivator worth twenty thousand immortal spirit stones?”
Lanyao asked, baffled!
“Who the hell’s got time to joke with you? That’s what the Huo family says, I don’t care what realm he’s at.”
“Now both of you, scram, if you piss me off, my boys haven’t touched a woman in ages!”
Tang Xiaoyi barked at the sisters!
“Young Master Tang, don’t get mad, we’re going…”
Hongyao quickly tugged at her sister, plastering on a sheepish grin!
But just as the sisters turned to leave, dozens of glowing orbs shot from their hands!
The orbs burst into blinding light, followed by a rapid string of explosions!
Caught off guard by the sudden attack, Tang Xiaoyi stumbled back!
“Move it, you wanna die here?”
Hongyao yanked Chen Ping up, and they bolted at top speed!
Meanwhile, Lanyao slapped a concealment talisman on Chen Ping to mask his aura, keeping Tang Xiaoyi and his crew from tracking him!
“Damn it, after them…”
Tang Xiaoyi roared, charging after them with his men!
Hongyao and Lanyao dragged Chen Ping for a full half-hour until the talisman wore off, finally stopping to catch their breath, panting hard!
They quickly popped a few pills to restore their stamina, while Chen Ping eyed them with surprise!
“Why’d you two save me?”
Chen Ping asked, puzzled!
“No reason…” Hongyao gasped out between breaths!
“We’ve got kind hearts, so how you gonna thank us?”
Lanyao asked!
“Kind hearts?” Chen Ping chuckled, “Kind hearts that strong-arm and bully the weak?”
Lanyao glared at him, “Strong-arming’s better than nothing, you saw someone’s already out to kill you for the reward.”
“So you sisters saved me just to cash in yourselves?”
Chen Ping grinned!
“Since you’ve figured it out, we won’t beat around the bush, never thought a Third-Grade Mahayana Realm guy like you’d be worth twenty thousand immortal spirit stones.”
“Either the Huo family’s gone nuts, or they’ve got too many stones to burn!”
“But don’t worry, I’ll make it quick, no pain.”
Hongyao looked at Chen Ping, actually trying to comfort him!
Chen Ping stared at the twin sisters and couldn’t help laughing!
These two had some smarts, but not much…
“What’s so funny? Not afraid to die?”
Lanyao demanded!
“I’m laughing at your brainpower—or lack of it,” Chen Ping said!
“What? You dare mock us?”
Lanyao pointed her sword at Chen Ping!
“Think about it, is the Huo family swimming in immortal spirit stones, or just plain stupid, offering twenty thousand to kill a Third-Grade Mahayana Realm cultivator like me?”
“Couldn’t they just send an elder to off me easy, no kill order, no twenty thousand stones?”
Chen Ping laid it out!
