In the Purgatory Arena, Chen Ping took a deep breath, and suddenly the entire area trembled. Immediately after, Chen Ping felt his bloodline and sword intent surge dramatically.
“Could I be breaking through my realm in this Purgatory Arena?” Chen Ping himself found it somewhat unbelievable!
Due to absorbing a vast amount of malevolent energy, Chen Ping no longer concealed his aura, fully exposing the presence of his three clans.
At this moment, Chen Ping’s heart was filled with a frenzied urge to kill, devoid of any emotion. All he craved was slaughter!
In the Purgatory Arena, Chen Ping’s aura continued to grow wildly, distorting the very space of the arena under the pressure of his presence.
“Young man, you need to rein it in a bit, don’t let yourself fall into madness. Though you carry the aura of the demon clan, it doesn’t mean you’re a true demon,” cautioned the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord.
“You just absorbed so much malevolent energy without transforming it through your cultivation technique. If you fall into madness, it’ll be trouble.”
The Crimson Cloud Demon Lord warned Chen Ping, sensing signs that he was on the verge of losing control.
Because Chen Ping had frantically absorbed malevolent energy for speed, bypassing the Heart Condensation Technique to convert it, he had taken it in directly.
Having absorbed so much malevolent energy, Chen Ping was now struggling to bear it.
Even for a true demon, absorbing such a quantity of malevolent energy at once without exploding would be considered fortunate.
Just as Chen Ping heeded the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord’s words, striving to suppress the murderous urge within, adjusting his breathing, and gradually calming his mind, a man slowly emerged from the depths of the Purgatory Arena. His hair was dishevelled, resembling a beggar, but the terrifying aura emanating from him proved he was a formidable expert.
Seeing the sudden appearance of this man, City Lord Niu Meng frowned, his eyes flashing with surprise, “This Mad Immortal, he’s still alive? Hasn’t he been in the Purgatory Arena for centuries?”
Niu Meng was astonished, for this man had entered the Purgatory Arena at the founding of Rhinoceros City and returned annually.
Due to his unkempt appearance and erratic behaviour, people began calling him the Mad Immortal.
However, centuries ago, after entering the Purgatory Arena, the Mad Immortal had never reappeared.
Gradually, people assumed he had died there, and he faded from memory.
Yet now, this forgotten Mad Immortal had emerged.
This left Niu Meng in awe, for someone to endure centuries in the Purgatory Arena required terrifying strength and resilience!
At this moment, the Mad Immortal had noticed Chen Ping, though Chen Ping had not yet noticed him.
Chen Ping was focused on guiding the murderous aura within him, slowly adjusting, feeling his realm on the brink of another breakthrough.
“A little fellow at the Immortal Transformation Realm daring to venture into the Purgatory Arena, and even slaying so many evil souls and demon corpses, quite interesting!” the Mad Immortal remarked.
As he approached Chen Ping, he was suddenly repelled by a force, pushed back in an instant.
Boom!
From within Chen Ping’s body, a long-suppressed power erupted, carrying an aura even more sinister and terrifying than the malevolent energy of the Purgatory Arena.
“What’s this?” the Mad Immortal froze.
Niu Meng, observing through a bronze mirror, was equally stunned by the scene.
Though he couldn’t sense the full terror of the aura Chen Ping unleashed, he could infer its magnitude from the Mad Immortal’s expression.
“Ahh!” Chen Ping roared skyward.
His internal aura began to surge, and his Eighth Grade Immortal Transformation Realm advanced in the instant of his roar.
As if venting his energy or achieving a breakthrough, his body calmed, and Chen Ping let out a long sigh of relief.
