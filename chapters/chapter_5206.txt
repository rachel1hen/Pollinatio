With a crisp “clang,” a blood mark appeared on the Demon General’s arm, black blood gushing out.
“Seeking death!”
The Demon General let out an enraged roar, swinging its axe at Chen Ping with a speed several times faster than before.
Chen Ping dodged hurriedly, but the axe’s edge grazed his shoulder, shattering his golden Unbreakable Body in an instant, leaving a deep, bone-revealing wound. Black demonic energy spread rapidly from the wound.
“Chen Ping!”
Hu Mazi shouted in alarm, wanting to rush forward to help, but he was locked in place by the Demon General’s aura, unable to move.
Chen Ping gritted his teeth, activating the Heart Condensation Technique to absorb the spreading demonic energy.
He knew he couldn’t delay any longer, he had to find the Demon General’s weakness quickly.
His gaze swept over the Demon General’s body, noticing a white scale on its chest, starkly different from the black scales elsewhere. “That’s its weakness!”
No longer dodging, Chen Ping charged towards the Demon General’s giant axe, channeling all his spiritual energy into the Dragon-Slaying Sword, its golden sword aura erupting with unprecedented brilliance.
“Foolish mortal!”
The Demon General roared, its massive axe swinging down with tremendous force towards Chen Ping’s head.
At the moment the axe was about to strike, Chen Ping suddenly sidestepped, narrowly avoiding it, while the Dragon-Slaying Sword struck like a venomous snake, piercing precisely into the white scale on the Demon General’s chest.
“Aaagh—”
The Demon General let out a piercing scream, its massive body trembling violently as black blood sprayed like a fountain.
“Now’s the time!”
Chen Ping shouted, tossing the Demon Flood Dragon’s core to Hu Mazi, “Use the core’s power to activate the sealing array!”
Hu Mazi caught the core and, following Chen Ping’s instructions, placed it in the central groove of the altar, then attached the prepared talismans to the runes around it.
The core’s power resonated with the talismans, causing the altar’s runes to glow brightly, forming a massive sealing dome that enveloped the Demon General.
The Demon General struggled frantically, trying to break free, but the sealing dome’s power grew stronger, trapping it firmly inside.
“No! I will not accept this!” The Demon General let out a desperate roar as its massive body gradually dissipated within the dome, turning into countless wisps of black mist absorbed by the seal.
As the Demon General vanished, the tremors in the underground palace subsided, and the demonic energy began to dissipate slowly.
The two finally breathed a sigh of relief, collapsing to the ground, panting heavily.
“Finally, we did it.”
Hu Mazi wiped the sweat from his face, looking at the now-calm altar, “We made it.”
Chen Ping nodded, glancing at the wound on his shoulder. Though the demonic energy had been absorbed, a sharp pain lingered.
“Youyue’s plan was truly vicious, she didn’t want us to retrieve any treasure, she used us to break the seal and release this Demon General.”
“So what do we do now?”
Hu Mazi looked at the demon core on the altar, “Do we take this core?”
“Take it! Why wouldn’t we?”
Chen Ping stood up, walked to the altar, and removed the demon core, “This core contains immense demonic energy. We can’t use it directly, but it might help us deal with Youyue, besides, we didn’t come here for nothing.”
He stored the core and glanced at the black longsword on the altar, “This sword is a treasure too. It’s a demonic sword, but its power is immense, it might come in handy.”
Hu Mazi stood up, joining Chen Ping and frowning at his shoulder wound, “Your injury…”
“It’s fine, just a minor wound.”
Chen Ping smiled, channeling spiritual energy to heal the wound, “Let’s get out of here, it’s not safe to stay.”
The two retraced their steps, encountering no further dangers.
When they emerged from the rift and returned to the surface of Jiupan Mountain, three days had passed.
