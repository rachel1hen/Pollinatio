“Die, then! Kill them all!”
Chen Ping roared, deaf to any attempts to dissuade him.
Elsewhere on the battlefield, Feng Xian swung his longsword, each strike cleaving enemy bodies in two.
But there were simply too many foes. His battle axe was drenched in blood, and his body bore multiple wounds.
Blood gushed from his injuries, soaking his clothes. Sweat and blood mingled, sliding down his cheeks and dripping onto the ground.
Bai Yi was faring no better. His breathing was rapid and heavy.
The soldiers of Xiniu City, whose morale had initially been high, were gradually worn down by the relentless tide of enemies.
Their wounds multiplied, their stamina nearly spent. The weapons in their hands grew heavier, each swing seeming to drain their entire strength.
Yet they held their ground, knowing that retreat meant certain death.
The white-clad girl’s spear was broken in half. Sweat beaded on her forehead, her breathing laboured. Over thirty corpses piled around her, yet enemies kept coming.
At that moment, several agile black-clad figures suddenly charged at Bai Yi from the side.
Bai Yi heard the sound of air breaking behind him and tried to turn and defend, but it was too late.
A flicker of despair crossed his eyes as he thought, “Is this the day I, Bai Yi, meet my end?”
At the critical moment, a figure flashed past Bai Yi like lightning.
It was Nuo Qing! His face bore a resolute expression, his body enveloped in a faint golden glow—the sign of an impending self-destruction.
“Master, get out of here!”
Nuo Qing shouted, his voice filled with determination and reluctance.
His body swelled instantly, the golden light growing ever brighter.
The black-clad men sensed danger and tried to retreat, but Nuo Qing had locked onto them.
With a deafening “boom,” blinding light illuminated the entire battlefield, and a powerful shockwave swept outward like a hurricane.
The black-clad men were obliterated in the explosion, while others nearby were flung back, crashing heavily to the ground.
Bai Yi was thrown backwards by the blast, landing hard, blood spilling from his mouth.
Struggling to his feet, he looked at the spot where Nuo Qing had vanished, his eyes filled with grief and rage.
“Nuo Qing!”
Bai Yi roared, his voice brimming with unbearable pain.
Nuo Qing had been with him for years, always loyal, but today…
Bai Yi lost all restraint. Low growls escaped his throat, and his body began to transform!
Soon, a massive nine-tailed fox appeared. Bai Yi, heedless of the danger, had assumed his true form!
Though this could boost his strength temporarily, it would cause irreversible damage to his body!
In this moment, Bai Yi didn’t care!
The massive explosion drew Chen Ping’s attention. He turned towards Bai Yi’s direction.
Seeing Nuo Qing’s self-destruction, the murderous intent in his heart surged even stronger.
“Go to hell!”
Chen Ping bellowed, swinging his Dragon-Slaying Sword again. The eight shadow clones, like eight gods of death, charged towards the enemy.
But at this point, Chen Ping was at his limit.
His eight shadow clones began to flicker and fade, his body swaying unsteadily.
Yet he gritted his teeth and pressed on, each sword swing draining every ounce of his strength.
Suddenly, Chen Ping let out an inhuman roar, and his eight clones merged back into his body.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword erupted with blinding blood-red light. He transformed into a crimson meteor, hurtling towards the densest part of the enemy ranks.
The black-clad men hurriedly formed a defensive formation, but the moment they made contact, they were shredded by the terrifying sword energy.
Where Chen Ping passed, the ground cracked, the air warped, as if even space itself couldn’t withstand this violent force.
