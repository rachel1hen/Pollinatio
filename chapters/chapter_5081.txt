Tianci and Elder Tong exchanged a glance, realising they had still underestimated Chen Ping. They turned to flee!
As Tianci turned to escape, he saw Chen Ping already standing in front of him.
Chen Ping pinched his throat with two fingers, using little force but rendering him completely immobile, “What’s this, didn’t learn your lesson from the beating I gave you a couple of days ago?”
“You… you dare touch me?” Tianci’s voice trembled, yet he still tried to act tough, “I’m a prodigy of Tianyuan Pavilion, if you harm me…”
“Harm you, so what?”
Chen Ping slightly increased the pressure with his fingertips, Tianci’s face instantly turned red, his eyes almost bulging out, “Go back and tell your Pavilion Master, if he dares to target Qingyun again, I’ll dismantle his Tianyuan Pavilion.”
“Chen Ping!”
Elder Tong roared with false bravado, “If you dare harm Tianci, Tianyuan Pavilion will come out in full force, ensuring you never know peace!”
Chen Ping turned to Elder Tong, his gaze cold as a blade, “Who have I ever feared? Go tell your Pavilion Master, if he’s got the guts, come and try.”
With that, he casually tossed Tianci towards Elder Tong, who hurriedly caught him but was pushed back over a dozen steps by the immense force.
The Mo family members were already dumbstruck.
Mo Qingchen’s face alternated between pale and flushed, he hadn’t expected this outcome!
This Chen Ping wasn’t even afraid of Elder Tong and Tianci!
At that moment, over a dozen terrifying auras suddenly approached from the distance above the Mo family!
As these auras drew near, the crowd saw a dozen black-clad figures hovering in the void!
“People from Shura Hall?”
Seeing the newcomers, the Mo family members were utterly shocked.
In the Second Heaven, Tianyuan Pavilion and Shura Hall were among the top forces.
Now, both major forces had shown up at the Mo family, leaving everyone trembling with fear, unsure why Shura Hall had suddenly arrived!
Leading Shura Hall was their Third Elder, his eyes fixed on the crowd below.
Seeing Shura Hall’s people, Elder Tong’s heart leapt with joy!
He knew Chen Ping had killed Shura Hall’s Sang Kun.
Shura Hall’s sudden arrival at this moment must be to seek revenge on Chen Ping.
Since they couldn’t kill Chen Ping themselves, they’d find a way to let Shura Hall do it, borrowing their blade to kill.
Even if Chen Ping had some terrifying force behind him, it wouldn’t trace back to Tianyuan Pavilion.
“So it’s the Third Elder of Shura Hall, a pleasure to meet you…”
Elder Tong stepped forward, his face full of smiles as he greeted them!
But the Third Elder didn’t even glance at Elder Tong, his eyes locked onto Chen Ping.
Seeing this, Chen Ping grew wary!
He knew Shura Hall’s people were likely here to kill him, after all, he had just killed their Sang Kun.
Mo Qingyun, seeing Shura Hall’s arrival, also grew tense.
“Daughter, what’s going on? Why are Shura Hall’s people here all of a sudden?”
Mo Wuji asked!
“Father, Chen Ping killed Shura Hall’s Sang Kun…” Mo Qingyun said!
“What?” Mo Wuji felt his vision darken, nearly fainting.
Both major forces of the Second Heaven had now been offended by Chen Ping.
No matter how capable Chen Ping was, he couldn’t possibly take on both Shura Hall and Tianyuan Pavilion alone.
Mo Qingchen, hearing this, burst into laughter, Chen Ping was done for now.
Once Chen Ping was dead, the position of Mo family head would be his, with no one to stop Elder Tong from helping him.
Elder Tong, seeing the Third Elder ignore him, felt a spark of anger, but at this moment, he could only endure it.
“Third Elder, are you here to seek revenge on that Chen Ping? This guy killed your young master Sang Kun.”
Elder Tong goaded!
