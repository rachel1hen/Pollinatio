Chen Ping pushed the Fire Control Step to its limit. His figure shuttled through the sword shadows like a ghost. The Dragon-Slaying Sword firmly protected his vital points. Each collision made his qi and blood surge.
“Is Chen Ping seeking death?” Hu Mazi stamped his feet in anxiety.
“He is probing Qin Lie’s strength.”
Li Chunfeng said gravely. “Qin Lie’s sword technique is fierce and domineering, with very few flaws. It is hard for Chen Ping to find an opportunity.”
In the field, Chen Ping’s situation became increasingly dangerous.
Qin Lie’s sword speed grew faster and faster. The sword qi condensed into a fierce tiger phantom, opening its bloody maw and pouncing towards Chen Ping.
“Roar!”
Where the fierce tiger phantom passed, the air was torn apart, emitting a piercing screech.
A trace of determination flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes. The baleful qi in his body suddenly erupted. The Dragon-Slaying Sword was covered in a layer of black mist. “Baleful Dragon Slash!”
A black dragon condensed from baleful qi roared out and fiercely collided with the fierce tiger phantom.
“Boom!”
Air waves swept in all directions. The onlooking cultivators retreated one after another.
After the smoke cleared, Chen Ping’s face was pale. His chest had caved in, clearly suffering a serious injury.
Qin Lie also retreated a step, a trace of surprise at the corner of his mouth.
“Interesting.” Qin Lie licked his lips. “Unfortunately, it is not enough!”
He gripped the sword hilt with both hands. Spiritual power surged wildly in. The long sword unexpectedly ignited with raging flames. “Heaven-Burning Sword Technique!”
Sword shadows overlapped. Each sword carried the high temperature to burn mountains and boil seas. The air was distorted from the scorching.
Chen Ping’s pupils contracted sharply. He could feel that this sword technique’s power was several times stronger than before. If hit directly, death was certain.
“I can only use that move!”
Chen Ping gritted his teeth. The divine dragon power in his body circulated madly. Golden scales emerged from under his skin.
Soon, the Indestructible Golden Body activated. Chen Ping’s entire body was covered in golden scales.
“This is… dragon scales?” Ling Xue exclaimed in shock.
Mo Chen was also shocked. “Is this kid a descendant of the dragon clan?”
Qin Lie saw the dragon scales. A trace of greed flashed in his eyes. “So you are a dragon clan bastard! No wonder you are so tough!”
His attacks became even fiercer. Each sword aimed at Chen Ping’s vital points.
Chen Ping no longer held back. Divine dragon power infused his legs. His figure suddenly accelerated, narrowly avoiding the sword edge. At the same time, the Dragon-Slaying Sword swept out horizontally, aiming straight at Qin Lie’s throat.
“Insignificant skill!” Qin Lie twisted his wrist. The long sword blocked it.
Just then, Chen Ping’s left hand quietly condensed a golden light orb. Taking advantage of the moment Qin Lie blocked, he fiercely slapped it towards his chest!
“Divine Dragon Rage!”
The golden light orb exploded. Dragon might spread out. Qin Lie felt a stuffiness in his chest. His qi and blood surged. He was actually shaken back five steps.
“You are courting death!”
Qin Lie was shocked and furious. He did not expect Chen Ping to hide such a powerful killing move.
Killing intent surged in his eyes. He raised the long sword high overhead. Spiritual power condensed into a huge fireball. “Heaven-Burning Earth-Destroying!”
The fireball rose like a mini sun. The emitted high temperature made the surrounding cultivators release spiritual power to protect themselves.
Chen Ping looked at the fireball that could burn him to ashes. A trace of resolution flashed in his eyes.
“It seems I have no choice but to use it.”
Chen Ping slowly raised his left hand and grasped the void.
“Buzz…”
A faint buzzing sounded. The entirely black Divine King Bow appeared out of thin air in his hand. The golden patterns on the bow body seemed to come alive, emitting a faint golden light.
“That is… a divine artifact!”
“It is actually the Divine King Bow! The legendary divine artifact that can shoot down gods!”
The onlooking cultivators exploded in uproar. Their eyes were filled with shock and greed.
Qin Lie also had a face of disbelief. “How is the Divine King Bow in your hands?”
Chen Ping did not answer. His right hand nocked on the bowstring. The Dao pattern baleful qi in his body instantly condensed into a brilliant arrow feather.
“Die!”
Chen Ping shouted lowly and released his right hand.
The arrow feather shot out like a meteor, carrying the momentum to tear heaven and earth. It instantly crossed dozens of zhang distance, shooting towards that huge fireball.
