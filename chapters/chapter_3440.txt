Chen Ping had sort of heard the general idea, but it seemed that this Ice Flame was indeed a good thing!
“Since this is a type of flame, that’s good!”
Chen Ping now had the Star of Fire Origin, so all he had to do was to absorb this Ice Flame and transform it into Origin Power!
Chen Ping stretched out his hand, the Beast Dan slowly dispersed in Chen Ping’s palm, and a ball of Ice Flame pulsed in his palm!
Looking at the ice flame in his palm, Chen Ping unexpectedly opened his mouth and directly swallowed that ice flame!
Seeing Chen Ping absorbing in this way, Bai Shao could not help but be staggered, knowing that ordinary cultivators would not dare to absorb like this!
The ice flame entered Chen Ping’s body and began to surge madly, while Chen Ping released the Origin of Fire and began to fuse that ice flame!
The Origin Space opened up, and the star of the Origin of Fire continued to emit light, a huge suction force, absorbing that manic Ice Flame!
In a short ten minutes, the ice flame was completely refined by Chen Ping, and the star of the Origin of Fire became much brighter!
Chen Ping flipped his wrist and a flame instantly struck out, and with that, a stone on the stone wall instantly melted!
And just at the moment when the stone melted and dripped, Chen Ping’s mind moved, and the melted stone was actually all frozen!
And it was still in liquid form, frozen in mid-air!
“Hahahaha, this is really great ……”
Chen Ping laughed out loud with excitement, he had never thought that there was such a thing as an Ice Flame!
The Supreme Fire could burn everything, but the Ice Flame could freeze everything, if Chen Ping wanted to get something, he could use the Ice Flame to freeze it!
If one used the Supreme Flame, then everything was burnt down and one could not get anything!
Chen Ping was overjoyed at the moment, looking at the Spirit Beast Egg that was bouncing in front of him, he directly reached out and grabbed it, followed by a Divine Sense striking into it!
He was too eager to know what kind of spirit beast was in this spirit beast egg, not only had it subdued the Lion and Tiger Beast, but it had even made the Lion and Tiger Beast willingly spit out the beast dan!
However, Chen Ping’s divine sense had just penetrated into the spirit beast egg when a dazzling and eye-catching multicoloured light rose up to the sky!
> Chen Ping didn’t even see what was in the Spirit Beast’s egg, and was so frightened that he directly withdrew his Divine Sense back!
He didn’t want everyone around him to be attracted by the light, and then he would be targeted again and chased by the crowd!
“What’s in here?”
Bai Shao asked to Chen Ping.
Chen Ping however shook his head “I don’t know!”
“This egg is so special, why do I feel panicky inside when I see this egg?”
Bai Qian asked with a frown!
Seeing this, Chen Ping hurriedly put the spirit beast egg into his storage ring!
Bai Shao was also a beast race, which was why she felt oppressed when she saw this spirit beast egg.
The reason why the fire phoenix didn’t feel it was because the fire phoenix had a noble bloodline and also had a spirit beast bloodline that was much more noble than Bai Shao’s nine-tailed fox!
“Master, that gong method was snatched away by the Ning family ……”
Fire Phoenix said after Chen Ping!
Chen Ping was not surprised when he heard this, he knew that the Ning family would strike at any time in front of a huge benefit!
After all, he did not have any deep friendship following the Ning Family!
When he had taken out the Divine King Bow himself, the Ning Family’s crowd had actually been moved, only for Chen Ping to hold out while the Ning Family’s crowd felt that they did not have full certainty before letting Chen Ping leave!
“Let’s go, maybe we can still chase after those people from the Ning family ……”
Leaving aside who discovered that technique first, now that the Ning Family had taken advantage of the fire, it made Chen Ping’s heart very unhappy!
Chen Ping turned to leave with Bai Shallow and Fire Phoenix, that Lion and Tiger Beast shook its head and got up, following behind as if sending Chen Ping and the others off!
Chen Ping saw that the lion and tiger beast had no malicious intent, so he did not care anymore and let him follow behind!
If this Lion and Tiger Beast could become his pet and follow him in the battlefield of Gods and Demons, that would be even better, then Chen Ping would not have to be afraid of that Qi Peijia!
Only Chen Ping’s idea could not be realised at all, just after Chen Ping had walked for a while, he found that the Lion and Tiger Beast was not following, and stood frozen in place looking at Chen Ping and the others!
