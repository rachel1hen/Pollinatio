Shura Hall!
The woman in white robes was sitting cross-legged in the room, a cauldron emitting white mist in front of her, filling the space with swirling fog.
At that moment, the door was pushed open, and the Third Elder slowly walked in.
“Third Elder, have you taught that Elder Tong from Tianyuan Pavilion a lesson?” the woman in white robes asked.
“Miss, I did teach him a lesson, but…”
“But what?” the woman in white robes pressed.
“But Elder Tong is dead, killed by that Chen Ping,” the Third Elder said, pausing before continuing, “The shadow of Tianyuan Pavilion’s Master was summoned, but Chen Ping shattered it and killed both Elder Tong and Tianci.”
“Oh?” The woman in white robes was somewhat surprised, “I didn’t expect this Chen Ping to be so formidable, not even taking Tianyuan Pavilion’s Master seriously.”
“It seems I underestimated him. It was wise not to send Shura Hall’s people to seek revenge.”
“This time, we’ll sit back and watch the tiger fight from the mountain, and see how Tianyuan Pavilion handles this matter!”
“Indeed, let’s see if Tianyuan Pavilion has the ability to deal with that Chen Ping!” the Third Elder nodded.
Just as he finished speaking, the door was suddenly blasted open by a powerful force, wood splinters scattering like snowflakes.
A figure clad in black armour strode in through the debris.
His black iron war boots struck the ground heavily, producing a dull sound, leaving deep footprints on the hard tiles.
This was Sang Qi, the eldest young master of Shura Hall, his handsome face now covered in frost.
His blood-red eyes burned with endless rage, and the Shura Blade at his waist trembled slightly, as if resonating with its master’s anger.
“Sang Lan!”
Sang Qi roared, his voice like thunder, shaking the cauldron in the room until it hummed, the white mist surging violently, “My brother Sang Kun died miserably, and you’re sitting here doing nothing?”
He fiercely drew his Shura Blade, the blade slicing through the air with a chilling gleam, pointing straight at Sang Lan.
The woman in white robes slowly opened her eyes, a trace of coldness flashing in them.
She rose gracefully, her aura surging suddenly, her white robes billowing without wind, an invisible pressure spreading like a tide in all directions.
“Brother, it’s not that I’m doing nothing, but the one who killed Sang Kun, that Chen Ping, has unfathomable strength and mysterious forces backing him.”
“Sang Kun provoked him first and was used as a pawn. If I rashly seek revenge, it will only drag Shura Hall into ruin!”
Sang Lan’s voice was cold as ice, each word clear and carrying an unquestionable authority.
“Nonsense!”
Sang Qi roared, veins bulging on his forehead, “Since when has Shura Hall become so cowardly?”
“I don’t care what forces back him. Anyone who dares kill a member of Shura Hall will be torn to pieces by me!”
With that, he turned to leave, intent on gathering Shura Hall’s experts for revenge.
“Stop!”
Sang Lan’s figure flashed, instantly appearing at the door, blocking Sang Qi’s path.
Her aura grew even sharper, faint sparks of lightning crackling in the air, “Father is in seclusion, and I am in charge of Shura Hall now. Without my orders, no one is to act rashly!”
Sang Qi laughed in fury, his laughter filled with mockery and disdain, “You? A woman wants to lead Shura Hall? No one will stop me today!”
He swung his blade fiercely at Sang Lan, the strike ferocious, accompanied by the sound of breaking wind, as if it would cleave everything in its path.
Sang Lan’s eyes narrowed, her hands forming seals, a black shield instantly materialising before her.
The Shura Blade struck the shield heavily, erupting in dazzling light and a tremendous roar, the powerful shockwave overturning all the tables and chairs in the room, sending the cauldron flying, white mist filling the entire space.
