“Temple Inspector?” Huo Jingjing exclaimed, “Why is he here too?”
The Inspector coldly scanned the scene below, his gaze finally settling on Chen Ping.
“Brat, I’m here for revenge.”
The Inspector said icily!
“Didn’t expect you to restore your body so quickly, but it’s useless. If I want to kill you, it’ll take mere minutes.”
Chen Ping sneered, “Didn’t expect you to restore your body so quickly, but it’s useless. I could kill you in a heartbeat.”
He was now at the third rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, more than capable of handling this Inspector.
“Didn’t expect that in just a few days, you’d reach the third rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, but it’s futile, I came prepared this time!”
The Inspector finished, and the Temple cultivators behind him erupted with terrifying auras.
These weren’t members of the Eight Halls, but elites brought by the Inspector himself.
“No matter how many you bring, I’ll kill them all. Think you can overwhelm me with numbers? I’m not afraid!”
Chen Ping was unfazed!
But Mo Qingyun, Hu Mazi, and the others looked gravely concerned!
“Chen Ping, at a time like this, stop showing off. They’re clearly prepared.”
Hu Mazi urged Chen Ping!
He knew Chen Ping loved to brag, but sometimes bragging could be deadly.
“Master Hu, don’t worry, I’m not just showing off this time.”
Chen Ping grinned!
He was confident because he had two warrior statues in his body, both incredibly powerful.
Even a fifth-rank Transcendent Realm cultivator had been defeated by these statues, indicating their strength could reach the sixth or seventh rank of the Loose Immortal Realm.
If the two statues combined forces, their power would be even greater.
Most importantly, the statues were lifeless and fearless, which was their greatest asset.
At that moment, the Inspector’s gaze fell on Huo Jingjing, and he frowned.
“Ant, you dare defile a divine maiden? Your crime deserves ten thousand deaths!”
The Inspector roared!
He could tell Huo Jingjing had been tainted.
Hearing this, Huo Zhao’s eyes widened, and he asked Huo Jingjing, “Jingjing, did someone sleep with you?”
Huo Jingjing nodded!
This sent Huo Zhao into a rage, while Huo Shizi bellowed, “Who is it? Who violated my sister? Show yourself!”
“It was me…” Chen Ping said with a faint smile!
“Chen Ping, you’re courting death…” Huo Zhao looked ready to swallow Chen Ping whole.
Huo Jingjing rushed forward, kneeling and pleading, “Father, Lord Inspector, please spare Chen Ping! I… I was willing!”
“What?!” Huo Zhao was furious, “Jingjing, are you mad? What is he, to be worthy of you?”
The Inspector’s eyes flashed with cold light, “A divine maiden must never marry an outsider! Huo Jingjing, you’ve violated divine law and must be severely punished!”
He raised his hand, and his bone whip lashed out towards Huo Jingjing!
Huo Zhao, heartbroken, didn’t dare intervene.
“Watch out!”
Chen Ping instantly flashed in front of Huo Jingjing, throwing a punch that repelled the bone whip!
“Old man, my woman isn’t yours to discipline!”
The Inspector’s pupils narrowed, “You dare fight back? I’ll kill you first, then clean up this mess!”
With his command, dozens of Temple experts attacked, their divine techniques overwhelming as they surged towards Chen Ping!
“Chen Ping!” Huo Jingjing cried, tears streaming down her face.
She hadn’t expected Chen Ping to protect her like this.
She thought he only desired her, not loved her.
But now, she realised she hadn’t loved the wrong man.
Chen Ping sneered, chanting under his breath, and two beams of black light shot out from his body, the two ancient warrior statues!
Their appearance stunned everyone!
“Kill!”
Chen Ping roared!
The two warriors struck instantly, moving like lightning.
