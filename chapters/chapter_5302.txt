“Puff!”
A muffled sound rang out. Chen Ping felt as if his back had been hit by a mountain; his entire body flew out like a kite with a broken string.
He crashed heavily into the dome of the Holy Light Hall, smashing a large hole in the hard glazed tiles, and fell embarrassingly onto the square outside the hall.
“Chen Ping!”
Hu Mazi and Mo Chen exclaimed simultaneously. No longer caring about anything else, they both rushed towards Chen Ping.
Wang Shengguang’s figure appeared in the sky above the square, looking down at Chen Ping who was lying on the ground like a dead dog. A cruel smile appeared on his face: “The Loose Immortal Realm is ultimately the Loose Immortal Realm. Even if you are a genius, it is impossible to challenge me across a major realm.”
He raised his right hand; a ball of light as dazzling as the sun condensed in his palm. The power contained within distorted the air.
“It is over.”
The light ball slowly descended towards Chen Ping. Wherever it passed, the ground began to melt, sending up wisps of white smoke.
At that moment, Hu Mazi and Mo Chen finally reached Chen Ping’s side.
Hu Mazi sacrificed all his talismans, forming a thick wall of talismans. Mo Chen blocked with his long sword in front. Both circulated their full spiritual power, attempting to block this fatal strike.
“Overestimating yourselves.” Wang Shengguang snorted coldly; the light ball in his palm trembled slightly.
“Boom!”
The talisman wall and sword qi shattered like paper in front of the light ball. Hu Mazi and Mo Chen both spat out blood, flew backwards, and crashed heavily to the ground; their lives were uncertain.
Chen Ping struggled to lift his head, looking at the two unconscious people. Bloodshot veins bulged in his eyes.
He wanted to stand up, but found that his limbs had completely lost sensation. The spiritual power and evil qi in his body were thoroughly disordered; even moving a finger was extremely difficult.
The light ball got closer and closer; the scorching aura already burned his skin painfully.
He could feel the shadow of death enveloping him. His heart was filled with unwillingness. Was he really going to die here?
Wang Shengguang revealed a victorious smile on his face. It was as if he could already see the scene of Chen Ping being purified into ashes by the holy light.
But just as the light ball was about to hit Chen Ping, a clear and cold voice suddenly resounded between heaven and earth:
“Sir, bullying the weak like this is rather unsightly, is it not?”
Before the words finished, a brilliant silver sword qi shot from the horizon like a meteor piercing the night, precisely slashing onto that golden light ball.
“Crack!”
A shocking scene occurred: the golden light ball, which could easily obliterate an Earth Immortal Realm cultivator, was actually sliced in half by this silver sword qi, then dissipated into the air like bubbles.
Wang Shengguang’s face changed drastically. He abruptly looked up towards the horizon; his eyes were filled with shock and disbelief: “This sword qi… is it you?”
A figure in white clothes was seen treading the air, coming over. His steps were not fast, yet they carried an aura of disdain for the world.
The newcomer held an ancient long sword, with a handsome face and indifferent eyes, as if nothing in the world entered his sight.
Chen Ping looked at the newcomer; his pupils suddenly contracted. This face, he had seen it!
On the Heaven-Ascending Ladder, that sword cultivator Li Chunfeng whom he had rescued!
Li Chunfeng landed in front of Chen Ping, gently waving his sword. A gentle sword qi swept over Chen Ping, Hu Mazi, and Mo Chen. The injuries on the three of them recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye.
He turned around; his gaze fell on Wang Shengguang. His tone was still flat, yet it carried an unquestionable killing intent: “You injured Mr. Chen, so you must die.”
Wang Shengguang looked at Li Chunfeng; for the first time, fear appeared on his face, and his voice trembled: “Li… Li Chunfeng? Were you not already disappeared for hundreds of years? How could you be here?”
“How do you know this Chen Ping?”
Li Chunfeng did not answer Wang Shengguang’s question, just faintly said: “Mr. Chen is my master.”
Master?
This word exploded like thunder in everyone’s ears.
