“Big Brother, I’ll stay with you,” Mad Immortal said.
“Get going, our main priority now is to protect Niu Ben, don’t forget why we’re here.”
Chen Ping waved him off!
Mad Immortal nodded, then, along with Bai Yi, took Niu Ben to leave!
But the Eight Halls people blocked their path.
“Clear the way…”
Chen Ping applied a bit of force, and Prince Huo immediately wailed like a banshee.
“Move aside…”
Seeing this, the Great Elder waved his hand.
Soon, Mad Immortal and Bai Yi left with Niu Ben, and after they were far enough, Chen Ping quietly breathed a sigh of relief.
Without Niu Ben holding him back, he could fight freely, and if he couldn’t win, he’d escape, Chen Ping was quite confident in his getaway skills.
Not to mention, he had Hu Mazi with him, a former Sixth Heaven expert.
“Can you release our prince now?” the Great Elder asked!
“No way, I want to trade your prince’s life for some resources…”
Chen Ping smirked.
Having such a trump card, Chen Ping had to make good use of it.
“Kid, you’re playing with fire!” The Great Elder’s face darkened.
“Playing with fire? How about playing with your sister?”
Hu Mazi stepped forward, mocking the Great Elder.
The Great Elder looked at Hu Mazi, his eyes suddenly flickering with faint white light, enveloping Hu Mazi instantly!
“Master Hu, watch out…” Chen Ping hurriedly warned.
“It’s fine, he can’t touch me!”
Hu Mazi stood still!
The Great Elder frowned, then took a step forward, the white light in his eyes turning golden.
At this, the Great Elder’s face grew even paler!
As the golden light continued to cover Hu Mazi’s body, the Great Elder’s expression worsened.
“You… you’re a reincarnated soul?”
The Great Elder stumbled back several steps.
“Exactly, if not for reincarnation, I wouldn’t even glance at a nobody like you.”
Hu Mazi sneered coldly.
Chen Ping was surprised, he didn’t expect the Eight Halls Great Elder to have such a skill, spotting Hu Mazi’s reincarnated identity at a glance.
“You’ve got some tricks, let’s see who I am.”
Chen Ping took off his armour, letting the Great Elder take a look.
The Great Elder glanced at Chen Ping, his eyes instantly flashing with golden light, but moments later, the light turned purple.
Sweat poured from the Great Elder’s forehead, and he collapsed to the ground with a thud!
Chen Ping was baffled, he hadn’t resisted at all, just a look, was it that serious?
The Great Elder slowly stood, looking at Chen Ping with confusion and doubt.
“Who the hell are you?” the Great Elder asked Chen Ping!
“Bloody hell, you stared for ages and saw nothing?”
Chen Ping was speechless.
“You’ve got mysterious energy protecting you, I can’t see through it.” The Great Elder shook his head, then pointed at Hu Mazi, “But your status is definitely far nobler than his.”
“Oi, what’s that supposed to mean? I’m some lowlife, am I?” Hu Mazi got mad!
He was about to throw hands, refusing to accept being called ignoble!
“Master Hu, don’t get upset, no need to care what others say.” Chen Ping quickly calmed him.
“I’m not upset, this guy’s got no eye for things.” Hu Mazi said, pretending to be calm!
But despite saying he wasn’t angry, he threw a punch at the Great Elder.
To everyone’s surprise, the Great Elder kept retreating, refusing to fight Hu Mazi.
Suddenly, he waved at his dozen subordinates, “We’re leaving…”
“Great Elder, Great Elder…”
Prince Huo was dumbfounded, how could they leave without saving him?
There were only Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, while they had so many people, if they fought, they’d surely win!
How could a couple of glances scare them off?
