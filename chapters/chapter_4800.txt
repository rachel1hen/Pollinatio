Dao Sect!
Two massive stones formed an archway, with the words “Dao Sect” carved into them by some unknown hand!
Beyond this archway lay rows of neatly arranged houses, usually a quiet place with hardly a soul in sight!
But every hundred years, when the Heaven-Climbing Ladder descended, this place buzzed with life, filled with cultivators arriving from all corners!
These cultivators gathered at the Dao Sect to await the ladder’s descent, and while waiting, they’d trade with one another.
Chen Ping strode into the Dao Sect alongside the sisters Hong Yao and Lan Yao, bold as brass!
He didn’t conceal his aura, nor did he alter his appearance!
His arrival left many onlookers visibly shocked!
After all, the Huo family had put a 200,000 immortal spirit stone bounty on Chen Ping’s head, yet here he was, swaggering into the Dao Sect!
Especially now, with the Heaven-Climbing Ladder yet to descend and no faction fully controlling the Dao Sect, if someone from the Huo family killed Chen Ping here, no one would step in to stop it!
On both sides of the street, pairs of eager eyes fixed on Chen Ping and his companions.
200,000 immortal spirit stones wasn’t a small sum!
And many of the cultivators here were at the peak of ninth-grade Mahayana or had even ascended to the Transcendent Immortal realm, the very ones most desperate for immortal spirit stones!
Yet Chen Ping’s blatant appearance at the Dao Sect made those with greedy intentions hesitate to act rashly!
After all, Chen Ping wasn’t an idiot, if he dared show up like this, he must have come prepared, perhaps with some powerful force backing him!
So until they could figure things out, no one dared make the first move, no one wanted to be the bird shot by the gun!
“Sister, so many people are staring at us, I’m getting shy, is it because we’re too pretty?” Lan Yao said bashfully, feeling the heat of the surrounding gazes!
“Don’t flatter yourself, they’re all looking at Master Chen. In their eyes, he’s a walking treasure chest, 200,000 immortal spirit stones, who wouldn’t be tempted?” Hong Yao shot Lan Yao a look and said!
Chen Ping, however, paid no mind to the onlookers’ stares. He found a crowded spot, waved his hand casually, and summoned the little Fire Qilin!
“Bloody hell? A divine beast Fire Qilin?”
“No way, how could there be a divine beast in the Celestial Realm?”
“It’s so small, could it really be a divine beast? It’s the size of a dog!”
The crowd’s attention shifted entirely to Chen Ping’s Fire Qilin, everyone scrutinising it, trying to figure out if it was truly a divine beast!
“What’s Mr. Chen up to? Why’s he suddenly acting so flashy?” the Tenth Hall Master wondered from the shadows, watching Chen Ping strut into the Dao Sect so ostentatiously, unable to guess his intentions!
“Brother, what’s Chen Ping thinking, coming to the Dao Sect to show off like this?” Lin Keting asked Lin Kefan from within the crowd!
“I’ve no clue, maybe he feels the Dao Sect has a place for our Sun Moon City, so he’s got no fear?” Lin Kefan replied, equally puzzled!
“It’s all your fault, Father and Master aren’t even here yet, and you went and told Chen Ping early, making him this cocky.”
“If someone tries to harm Chen Ping now, you’d better step up for me. If anything happens to him, I’ll never forgive you!” Lin Keting glared at Lin Kefan, blaming him!
“Truly, a grown daughter can’t be kept at home…” Lin Kefan sighed!
“What are you lot staring at? Never seen a divine beast before? Keep gawking, and I’ll dig your eyes out!”
“Get lost, all of you…” Chen Ping barked arrogantly, pointing his Dragon-Slaying Sword at the crowd!
The crowd: “…”
Hong Yao and Lan Yao stared at Chen Ping in utter shock.
“Master Chen, tone it down a bit, we said to act bold, but not *this* bold, you’re offending everyone!”
“If you rile them all up and they gang up on us, we’ll be lucky to have scraps left!” Hong Yao whispered nervously into Chen Ping’s ear!
