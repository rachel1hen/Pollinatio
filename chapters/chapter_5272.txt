“Your foundation is solid, but your swordsmanship relies too heavily on bursts of spiritual energy, lacking the agility a swordsman should possess.”
Every afternoon, Mo Chen would guide Chen Ping in the sword hut. He never demonstrated himself, merely sitting on a bamboo couch, running his fingers over a pitch-black wooden sword, occasionally pointing out flaws in Chen Ping’s practice.
“Look at that old bamboo.”
Mo Chen gestured toward a green bamboo outside the window, bent by the fierce wind. “It bends when the wind comes and straightens when it passes. It seems weak, yet its resilience is profound. A sword should be the same; unyielding strength cannot last, nor can constant yielding endure. Only by balancing strength and flexibility can one move freely and decisively.”
Chen Ping focused on the bamboo, watching how it seemed on the verge of snapping yet always shifted slightly at the wind’s peak, dissipating most of its force. A sudden realisation struck him. His Dragon-Slaying Sword hummed, and his once fierce and domineering sword moves became fluid. The sword’s light swayed like bamboo shadows, at times thrusting like a bamboo shoot piercing the earth, at others slicing like leaves sweeping through the wind.
“Hmm, that’s more like it.”
A glint of approval flashed in Mo Chen’s eyes. “Swordsmanship has no fixed rules. Those bound by forms are mere craftsmen; those who grasp the principles become masters. Your earlier swordplay was too fixated on ‘slashing,’ forgetting that a sword can also ‘entwine,’ ‘circle,’ and ‘deflect.'”
With that, he flicked his finger, and a bronze sword by the couch shot into the air, transforming into a streak of light aimed at Chen Ping. The strike seemed slow but sealed off all angles of escape.
Chen Ping’s heart tightened. His instinct was to block with brute force, but Mo Chen’s words echoed in his mind. His wrist twisted, and the Dragon-Slaying Sword coiled around the bronze sword like a serpent. With a gentle slide along its spine, he redirected the bronze sword’s force. As the swords crossed, his wrist flicked again, the blade pointing straight at the bronze sword’s hilt.
“Clang!” The bronze sword fell, ringing crisply.
Chen Ping stood frozen, the insight from that moment hitting him like a revelation. His spiritual energy surged, shattering the bottleneck of the Seventh Grade of the Loose Immortal Realm. A stronger power flooded his limbs; he had reached the Eighth Grade.
“A breakthrough?” Hu Mazi gaped from the sidelines. “In just a few days? Chen Ping, your cultivation speed is inhuman!”
Mo Chen rose and approached Chen Ping, showing a rare smile of satisfaction. “Well done. You grasped it instantly. Your comprehension surpasses mine in my youth.”
At that moment, a Sword Sect disciple rushed into the courtyard, shouting excitedly, “Senior Brother! Master Mo Chen! The Sword Saint City’s Centennial Swordsmanship Tournament is about to begin! All the major sects are registering!”
Chen Ping’s interest piqued. “What’s this Swordsmanship Tournament?”
The disciple explained the tournament to Chen Ping.
“Swordsmanship Tournament?” Hu Mazi rubbed his hands eagerly. “Sounds lively. Chen Ping, shall we join in?”
Chen Ping looked at Mo Chen, noticing his slight frown, as if he were unenthusiastic for some reason.
Days later, news of the tournament spread across Sword Saint City. Major sects registered eagerly, and even sword-cultivating clans from thousands of miles away sent representatives. The Sword Sect disciples grew restless, and core disciples like Ling Xue sought out Mo Chen, pleading to participate.
“Master, this is a once-in-a-century chance. Even if we don’t win, we can learn from other sects’ swordsmanship!” Ling Xue’s tone was earnest.
Mo Chen remained silent for a long time before shaking his head. “Your skills are still lacking. This tournament is filled with hidden dangers. Many sects will stop at nothing for rankings. Participating would only risk your lives.”
“But…” Ling Xue tried to argue, but Mo Chen cut her off.
“Especially the Divine Sword Manor,” Mo Chen’s voice grew heavy. “They’ve long held a grudge against our Sword Sect. Their disciples are ruthless. If you face them in the tournament, they will show no mercy.”
