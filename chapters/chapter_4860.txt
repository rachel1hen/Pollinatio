Chen Ping still sat cross-legged on the ground, enduring the relentless bombardment of terrifying thunder tribulation!
Between heaven and earth, aside from the fearsome streaks of lightning, Huo Zhao was also locked in a fierce exchange with Lin Chong and the other three!
The four of them together couldn’t even scratch Huo Zhao!
“Bloody hell, if I weren’t down to a third of my strength, I’d have killed you by now!” Nan Batian cursed furiously, enraged that the four of them couldn’t defeat Huo Zhao!
Their power had already been heavily suppressed, and after a gruelling battle, they’d expended much of their immortal energy!
Now, facing Huo Zhao, they were clearly struggling far too much!
Huo Zhao, on the other hand, had been biding his time, so even against the four of them, he didn’t falter in the slightest!
“You four, get out of my way…”
Huo Zhao let out a thunderous shout, a terrifying aura sweeping forth, Lin Chong and the others resisted desperately, but in the end, they were still sent flying!
There was simply no way, their exhaustion was too great!
After blasting Lin Chong and the others away, Huo Zhao charged towards Chen Ping!
The numerous cultivators of Sun-Moon City rushed at Huo Zhao with reckless abandon, heedless of their lives!
Boom!
Boom!
Boom!
Each sound marked the death of a Sun-Moon City cultivator, they stood no chance against Huo Zhao!
“Chen Ping, hurry up and break through, hurry…” Lin Keting watched Chen Ping, praying anxiously!
After cutting down over a dozen Sun-Moon City cultivators in succession, Huo Zhao threw a punch straight at Chen Ping!
At that moment, Chen Ping’s eyes snapped open, golden light erupted across the heavens, and the thunder tribulation clouds that had filled the sky slowly dissipated!
Great Ascension Realm, Sixth Rank, Chen Ping had leapt two minor realms in one go!
But just as he opened his eyes, a wave of dangerous energy surged towards him!
He could feel the breath of death, Huo Zhao’s punch was like countless mountains pressing down on him, rendering him utterly immobile!
Was he doomed to die helplessly right after his breakthrough?
Chen Ping’s heart burned with unwillingness, suddenly, the dragon crystal on his chest flared, the power of the three clans surged within him, and his Indestructible Golden Body enveloped his flesh!
Boom!
Boom!
This punch instantly shattered Chen Ping’s Indestructible Golden Body, and the unleashed power of the three clans was suppressed as well!
Chen Ping himself was flung back a hundred li!
“Chen Ping…”
“Mr. Chen…”
Everyone cried out in shock!
Chen Ping’s figure vanished, and a faint smirk curved Huo Zhao’s lips!
A mere Great Ascension Realm cultivator, one punch from him could crush them, after all, Huo Zhao was an immortal, even if this summoned form wasn’t his true body, it wasn’t something a Great Ascension cultivator could contend with!
But just as Huo Zhao basked in his triumph, a streak of golden light sped towards him!
When the light halted, everyone realised it was Chen Ping, despite being hurled a hundred li, he hadn’t suffered severe injuries!
This left Huo Zhao utterly stunned!
Chen Ping swept his gaze over the corpses of the Sun-Moon City cultivators on the ground, his eyes brimming with murderous intent.
“Did you kill all these people?” Chen Ping asked.
“Indeed!” Huo Zhao nodded.
Chen Ping stared at the Sun-Moon City cultivators who’d died protecting him, and suddenly, he went berserk!
“I’ll make you pay with your life…”
Chen Ping roared, the power of the three clans, the might of the divine dragon, the murderous aura of the Dao patterns…
All his strength poured into the Dragon-Slaying Sword!
Gripping the sword with both hands, Chen Ping swung it down fiercely at Huo Zhao!
Boom!
As the sword slashed down, a piercing hum rang out!
Huo Zhao sneered, casually throwing a punch!
Countless sword beams shattered, and Chen Ping was once again sent reeling back!
Though Chen Ping had jumped two realms, the gap between him and Huo Zhao remained significant!
Chen Ping released the Dragon-Slaying Sword and gripped the Divine King Bow instead!
As he drew the string, the surrounding murderous aura surged into the bow!
