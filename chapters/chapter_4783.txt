“Father, what’s going on here?”
Yun Li, full of confusion, couldn’t grasp it, his father was the Tenth Hall Master, such a proud figure, how’d he suddenly become Chen Ping’s lackey?
Slap!
Out of nowhere, the Tenth Hall Master smacked himself!
“Sigh, it’s my overconfidence, daring to cross Mr. Chen, thanks to his mercy, I now follow him, you’d better show some respect to Mr. Chen from now on!”
The Tenth Hall Master declared!
Yun Li was dumbfounded, he couldn’t fathom what his father had been through, a man so lofty, reduced to this!
If Yun Li knew his father had just been scared shitless—literally—he’d get it!
The Tenth Hall Master was genuinely kicking himself now, if he’d taken Chen Ping seriously from the start, avoided picking a fight, none of this would’ve happened!
“It’s all that Zuo Tianzheng from the Demon Sealing Alliance’s fault, if I ever see him, I’ll kill him…”
The Tenth Hall Master’s deepest grudge now, aimed square at Zuo Tianzheng!
After all, the beef between the Tenth Hall and Chen Ping, kicked off with the Demon Sealing Alliance, sparked by Zuo Tianzheng!
If Zuo Tianzheng hadn’t sicced that century-long bounty on Chen Ping, Chen Ping wouldn’t have gone toe-to-toe with the alliance!
It’s just a dead son, so what, he’s gone!
For cultivators at their level, with millennia of life, they could sire sons anytime!
“Tell me about this Huo family…” Chen Ping asked the Tenth Hall Master!
Huo Qing could call in family muscle, fearless of the Tenth Hall Master, their strength must outstrip the Tenth Hall!
“Mr. Chen, I don’t know much about the Huo family, just that they’re a big godkin clan, lots of their elders serve in the Divine Hall.”
“That Huo Qing, he was planted in my Tenth Hall by the higher-ups, so the git often doesn’t give me, the Tenth Hall Master, any respect.”
The Tenth Hall Master explained to Chen Ping!
Chen Ping’s brow creased slightly, “This Huo family’s in the Celestial Human Realm too?”
“The ones here are just a branch, but even a branch packs a punch!”
“Most importantly, the Huo family controls the Lawless Land in the Celestial Human Realm, holding that place is like owning the Heaven Ladder…”
The Tenth Hall Master said!
“Lawless Land? Doesn’t the Heaven Ladder pop up randomly anywhere?” Chen Ping glanced at Yun Li, puzzled!
That’s how Yun Li had put it!
“The Heaven Ladder’s random, sure, but eight out of ten times, it shows up in the Lawless Land, over the years, this year’s ladder’s likely to hit there again.”
“The Lawless Land, it’s a space born from twisted spacetime when the Celestial Human Realm split open, free from the grand array’s grip, but also cut off from heaven’s nurturing, it floats outside the laws of the world!”
The Tenth Hall Master broke down the Lawless Land for Chen Ping!
“There’s a spot that cushy?” Chen Ping blinked, “Then why don’t those trapped Celestial Realm cultivators head to the Lawless Land and bounce back to the Celestial Realm?”
If it’s free of the grand array, just hop back!
The Tenth Hall Master chuckled, “Mr. Chen, everything’s got its pros and cons, the Lawless Land’s outside the array, sure, but it’s got no spiritual energy, no resources, and no way to ascend to the Celestial Realm.”
“Almost every world spawns one or more of these Lawless Lands, size varies, they don’t show up in the cosmic order, and they sure as hell don’t link to other realms!”
“Celestial Human Realm cultivators can ascend because there’s a channel to the Celestial Realm, but the Lawless Land, it’s only tied to its own world, no connections elsewhere!”
“So even without the array holding them, those trapped Celestial Realm folks dreaming of using the Lawless Land to get back, it’s pure fantasy.”
“Plus, with no resources there, how’d they cultivate or survive?”
The Tenth Hall Master’s words, left Chen Ping feeling like he’d struck gold with insight!
