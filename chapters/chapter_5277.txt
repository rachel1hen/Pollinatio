“Young Sect Leader, rest assured!” Zhao Jingfeng nodded.
In the following matches, Zhao Jingfeng continued to dominate, using the overpowering “Sky-Splitting Sword Technique” to defeat two fourth-grade Earth Immortal opponents in succession, advancing to the top eight.
Li Hanjiang from the Seven Stars Sword Sect also performed impressively. His “Seven Stars Linked Sword” was unpredictable, with seven sword shadows interconnected like the Big Dipper, overwhelming opponents and securing his place in the quarterfinals.
In the top eight, Chen Ping faced a disciple from the Frost Valley, a fifth-grade Earth Immortal who wielded the “Frost Sword Technique,” capable of freezing an opponent’s spiritual energy.
As the match began, the disciple swung his sword, conjuring a blanket of icy mist that enveloped the entire stage.
Within the mist, countless ice spikes shot toward Chen Ping like rain, carrying a bone-chilling cold.
The crowd below watched as Chen Ping’s figure flickered in and out of the mist, moving as if strolling leisurely.
With each swing of the Dragon-Slaying Sword, he precisely shattered the incoming ice spikes. Wherever his sword light passed, the icy mist parted, unable to approach him.
“This… is this a ‘Sword Domain’?” a swordsmanship expert cried out in shock.
A Sword Domain was a realm only Earth Immortal sword cultivators could comprehend, allowing their sword intent to influence the surrounding environment, creating a unique field.
But Chen Ping was merely an eighth-grade Loose Immortal. How could he have grasped a Sword Domain?
Amid the crowd’s astonishment, a scream suddenly rang out from the mist.
As the mist cleared, the Frost Valley disciple was seen clutching his chest, staggering back with blood trickling from his mouth. His sword was already broken in two.
Chen Ping stood holding his sword, its blade still pristine, as if it had never been used.
“I concede…” the Frost Valley disciple muttered with difficulty before turning and leaving the stage.
The arena fell silent.
An eighth-grade Loose Immortal, comprehending a sword intent barrier, defeating a fifth-grade Earth Immortal!
This could no longer be described as “heaven-defying.” It was simply unimaginable!
Mo Chen stood below, trembling with excitement.
He could sense that Chen Ping’s display was not a true Sword Domain but rather an extreme condensation of sword intent, forming an invisible barrier. Though not as powerful as a real Sword Domain, it far surpassed cultivators of the same level.
Such mastery of sword intent left even Mo Chen feeling inferior.
“Excellent! What a Chen Ping!” The Sword Saint City overseer stood up abruptly, clapping and laughing heartily. “In my lifetime, to witness such a genius, I am truly fortunate!”
On the VIP platform, other sect leaders and elders nodded in approval, their eyes filled with admiration and amazement for Chen Ping.
Only Zhao Jingfeng’s face darkened, as if it could drip with water.
He had initially thought Chen Ping was just a lucky rogue cultivator, but he hadn’t expected such strength.
A sense of crisis surged within him. He vaguely felt that Chen Ping might become the greatest obstacle to his championship.
“Sect Leader, this kid…” Zhao Jingfeng looked at Qin Lie, his tone tinged with unease.
Qin Lie said coldly, “Just some unorthodox tricks. In the quarterfinals, his opponent is Li Hanjiang. Let’s see if he can pass this hurdle.”
Li Hanjiang’s “Seven Stars Linked Sword” had reached a masterful level, and his fifth-grade peak Earth Immortal cultivation was a step above the Frost Valley disciple.
Many believed that even if Chen Ping could defeat the Frost Valley disciple, he was no match for Li Hanjiang.
The final match of the quarterfinals was the showdown between Chen Ping and Li Hanjiang.
This match drew everyone’s attention.
On one side was the ultimate dark horse, an eighth-grade Loose Immortal who had defeated strong opponents and mastered a sword intent barrier: Chen Ping.
On the other was the renowned core disciple of the Seven Stars Sword Sect, a fifth-grade peak Earth Immortal: Li Hanjiang.
Though the two had not yet clashed, an invisible pressure already permeated the stage.
Li Hanjiang, dressed in a blue robe, wielded a silver long sword embedded with seven blue gemstones, the Seven Stars Sword Sect’s treasured “Seven Stars Sword.”
