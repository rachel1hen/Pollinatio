“Tell Tianci to focus on recovering from his injuries and not to think about revenge,” the Pavilion Master said calmly.
“But… given Tianci’s temperament, I’m afraid…” Elder Tong hesitated.
Tianci was extremely proud. After such a setback, how could he possibly not seek revenge?
“Hmph, if he doesn’t listen, we’ll strip him of his title as a prodigy. Tianyuan Pavilion doesn’t lack for prodigies,” the Pavilion Master said with a cold snort.
“I understand,” Elder Tong nodded repeatedly.
…
Shura Hall!
A woman in white robes sat in a void, surrounded by terrifying auras that emanated continuously.
The surrounding void began to blur under the impact of these auras.
After an unknown amount of time, the woman in white slowly opened her eyes.
Boom!
The surrounding void exploded instantly, and her body landed on the ground.
“Congratulations, Miss. You have reached the eighth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm and restored your depleted vitality,” an elder stepped forward to congratulate her.
The woman in white took a deep breath, her eyes gleaming with excitement.
She had been stuck at the seventh rank of the Loose Immortal Realm for years. With her strength, she could have ventured into the Third Heaven.
But to break through the seventh rank, she had stayed in Shura Hall.
Yet, for so many years, she hadn’t succeeded.
This time, during the expedition to the ruins, a mysterious elder had caused her cultivation to skyrocket, filling her with joy.
But when she later learned the elder was a fraud, she panicked.
Without vitality, what use was a higher realm?
Upon returning, she relied on Shura Hall’s resources to frantically restore her vitality, while her rapidly gained cultivation began to plummet.
It was clear the mysterious elder had used some ancient divine technique to temporarily boost their cultivation.
Through her efforts, the woman in white restored her vitality and reached the eighth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm.
This time, facing the arrogant Tianci, she no longer had to fear him.
“Third Elder, didn’t you just say that Chen Ping has also come to the Second Heaven?” the woman in white asked the elder.
“Indeed, Chen Ping is with Mo Qingyun, heading to the Mo family,” the elder replied. “It’s likely that Tianyuan Pavilion pressured the Mo family, leaving them no choice but to summon Mo Qingyun, and Chen Ping is accompanying her.”
“Should we intercept Chen Ping? After all, he possesses two coffins from the ruins. Who knows what treasures might be inside?” the elder added.
The woman in white remained silent, her eyes narrowing slightly.
The coffins from the ruins surely contained treasures, and she was tempted.
But thinking of Chen Ping’s strength and those two warrior statues, she felt a twinge of fear.
Seeing her hesitation, the Third Elder said, “Miss, why not send someone to probe Chen Ping’s background first?”
“No need, let’s wait and see,” the woman in white shook her head.
The Third Elder frowned slightly, “Miss, if Chen Ping reaches the Mo family, Tianyuan Pavilion will surely notice him. They won’t let him go.”
“If that happens, those two coffins might end up in Tianyuan Pavilion’s hands.”
The woman in white fell silent, weighing the pros and cons.
“Miss, we can’t hesitate. We must not let Tianyuan Pavilion get those treasures,” the Third Elder urged.
Suddenly, the woman in white said, “Third Elder, have you considered why Chen Ping dares to go to the Mo family?”
“Doesn’t he know about the relationship between the Mo family and Tianyuan Pavilion?”
“The reason he dares to go is that he doesn’t take Tianyuan Pavilion seriously at all.”
“Why doesn’t he take Tianyuan Pavilion seriously?”
Her series of questions left the Third Elder stunned.
