Chen Ping was stunned for a moment, then sneered, “Miss Huo, you’re a deity, how could you fancy an ‘ant’ like me?”
“Don’t tease me, I know your divine race isn’t allowed to bond with other races.”
Huo Jingjing looked up, her eyes filled with shy irritation, “Why do you keep mentioning the divine race! I… I was naive, brainwashed…”
“We’re all human, and that night with you, you showed me what paradise is.”
Huo Jingjing’s voice softened, her cheeks flushed.
It turned out that after Chen Ping “forced” himself on her, Huo Jingjing was initially furious, but as time passed, she found her mind filled with thoughts of him.
Chen Ping hadn’t expected this proud divine woman to be conquered by him so quickly.
It seemed even the most arrogant woman feared a big stick.
Looking at her shy demeanour, Chen Ping’s heart stirred, and he lifted her chin, “Since you like me, I won’t leave tonight, let me take you to paradise again.”
“You… mmph!”
Before Huo Jingjing could finish, Chen Ping kissed her lips, and she melted into his arms…
…
The next morning, as Chen Ping opened his eyes, he sensed a wave of jealousy!
Stepping out of the dungeon, he found Mo Qingyun already at the entrance.
Mo Qingyun looked at Chen Ping with a mix of helplessness, anger, and jealousy.
But she knew she had no claim over Chen Ping, having only recently met him, and couldn’t control who he slept with.
“Miss Mo, why are you here?” Chen Ping asked, puzzled, upon seeing her.
“I heard you didn’t leave the dungeon all night, I was worried that woman might harm you, so I came to check!”
Mo Qingyun said.
“It’s fine, I’ve tamed her!”
Chen Ping called into the dungeon, “Jingjing, come out…”
Huo Jingjing emerged, her face flushed, limping slightly.
Her bloodlines, previously restricted, had been fully unlocked by Chen Ping.
Seeing Mo Qingyun, Huo Jingjing blushed and lowered her head.
“All good then!” Mo Qingyun turned and left.
“Is Miss Mo jealous?” Huo Jingjing remarked.
“No way, why would she be jealous? We’re not even close.”
Chen Ping said, utterly confused.
“She definitely likes you, a woman’s intuition is sharp, if you want, just take her too.”
Huo Jingjing said considerately.
“I never force anyone…” Chen Ping replied.
Hearing this, Huo Jingjing could only roll her eyes!
If Chen Ping hadn’t forced her, she might not have fallen for him.
At that moment, a terrifying aura surged from afar, enveloping the Cangxuan Continent.
The cultivators of the continent were all shocked!
Having suffered several devastating blows, they were now like startled birds.
As the terrifying aura rolled in, a furious roar echoed.
“Chen Ping! Come out and face your death!”
“Release my daughter…”
The roar thundered through the sky, shaking the mountains and rivers.
Huo Jingjing snapped awake, her face pale, “It’s Father! He’s here with others!”
Chen Ping sneered, “Perfect timing, we should clear things up with him.”
“We’re family now, no need for fighting.”
Chen Ping led Huo Jingjing out.
At that moment, Lan Lianhua’s face was grave, staring into the void above!
The horizon was dark with hundreds of cultivators hovering in the air, led by Huo Zhao!
Beside Huo Zhao stood a masked man, his aura unfathomably deep.
Chen Ping recognised him instantly, it was the Temple Inspector whose body they had destroyed.
