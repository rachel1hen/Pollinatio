After all, last night he had witnessed Chen Ping’s strength. Only such a stark contrast in physique could make the opponent underestimate him.
Seeing everyone betting on his side, Bao Hu sneered even more at Bai Yi.
“Old Bai, the match hasn’t started yet. If you chicken out now, just apologise to me, and you won’t have to pay a thing,” Bao Hu said to Bai Yi.
“Cut the bloody nonsense and start,” Bai Yi replied.
With a wave of Bao Hu’s hand, four beams of light shot up around the arena, emitting rays that connected to form a barrier, enveloping the entire stage.
Chen Ping looked at the intricate array and couldn’t help but chuckle. The arena at Bao Hu House was far inferior to the official ones outside.
“Such a large space, yet the array on this stage is so cumbersome, outdated, and full of flaws,” Hu Mazi remarked with a cold laugh.
Bao Hu shot Hu Mazi a glare, clearly displeased at the criticism of his arena. But with limited array masters, and none particularly skilled, this was the best formation they could manage.
“The array is activated, the match begins!” Bao Hu bellowed.
Little Tiger grinned at Chen Ping, “Sorry, kid. Once I beat you, my boss will share the winnings, and I can go have some fun with the ladies.”
With that, Little Tiger swung a fist at Chen Ping. The fist, larger than Chen Ping’s head, came crashing down from above with such force that it broke the sound barrier, powered purely by physical strength.
Chen Ping watched the incoming punch, unmoving, his eyes filled with contempt. From the way Little Tiger threw the punch, Chen Ping knew he could stand still and still break the man’s arm.
“Is this guy scared stiff?”
“Standing there, not moving? That’s just asking for death!”
“If you can’t win, at least dodge! What’s with standing still?”
The crowd was baffled by Chen Ping’s inaction.
“Master…” Nuo Qing frowned, calling out to Bai Yi. After all, Chen Ping was Bai Yi’s son-in-law. If he got smashed to death with one punch, it’d be utterly humiliating.
Bai Yi said nothing, watching Chen Ping on the stage with a calm expression.
*Boom!*
Little Tiger’s fist slammed into Chen Ping’s body. The arena shook violently, and everyone assumed Chen Ping was done for.
“Ahh!”
A piercing scream echoed, but it didn’t come from Chen Ping. It was Little Tiger. His arm was a bloody mess, his massive fist now exposing shattered bones, the skin pierced through by fractured fingers.
Chen Ping stood rooted to the spot, unscathed, a mocking smile on his face.
“What?”
The crowd gasped in shock. That punch from Little Tiger carried a thousand pounds of raw, physical force, no techniques involved. A blow like that could reduce a man to pulp, yet Chen Ping was completely fine.
Bao Hu’s eyes widened in disbelief. Even Nuo Qing was stunned, clearly caught off guard.
Bai Yi, however, laughed, his face beaming with satisfaction.
“Little Tiger, what’s going on?” Bao Hu roared.
“Boss, this guy’s body is like steel. I can’t hurt him!” Little Tiger said dejectedly, his bloodied arm hanging limp.
“Useless bloody idiot! You’ve got another hand. Finish him off, don’t you dare surrender!” Bao Hu shouted, furious. This was ten thousand immortal coins on the line.
The crowd joined in, “Kill him, kill him!”
They’d all bet on Bao Hu House. If Little Tiger lost, they’d lose everything.
Gritting his teeth, Little Tiger raised his left hand, clenching it into a fist. With a guttural roar, he swung at Chen Ping again, ignoring the excruciating pain.
