However, Chen Ping’s eyes were clear as he used his bloodline to suppress the malevolent energy.
Suddenly, a golden light shot into the sky from Chen Ping’s body, accompanied by the resounding roar of a dragon.
The murderous intent enveloping Chen Ping began to fade, and the malevolent energy surrounding him gradually dissipated.
Seeing the killing intent subside, Mad Immortal dared to approach slowly.
Observing Mad Immortal’s cautious demeanour, Chen Ping chuckled, “Senior, my apologies for startling you…”
“Damn, you really did scare me,” Mad Immortal replied.
Relieved that Chen Ping was truly unharmed, Mad Immortal let out a long breath. Had Chen Ping’s mind been corrupted by the malevolent energy and turned against him, Mad Immortal wasn’t sure he could have withstood it.
“Senior, are there other places in this Purgatory Field with even denser malevolent energy?” Chen Ping asked.
“No, absolutely not. I’ve been here for centuries, and there’s nothing like that,” Mad Immortal hurriedly shook his head.
Even if he knew of such a place, he wouldn’t dare lead Chen Ping there. It was too terrifying, if Chen Ping lost control, Mad Immortal would be in grave danger.
“Since there aren’t any, I need to refine the malevolent energy in my body and fully absorb it, so I won’t be accompanying you, Senior.”
Chen Ping produced the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda, intending to enter it to cultivate and completely absorb the malevolent energy within him.
Though he appeared fine now, it was only because he was suppressing it with his bloodline.
“What’s that thing?” Mad Immortal asked, intrigued.
“Just a small pagoda. Would you like to come inside, Senior?” Chen Ping inquired.
“Is that allowed?” Mad Immortal was very curious.
“Of course!” Chen Ping replied, leading Mad Immortal into the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda.
“This pagoda seems empty, nothing special about it. What’s so great about it?” Mad Immortal asked, puzzled.
“Senior, just cultivate here. When we leave, you’ll understand its benefits,” Chen Ping said.
With that, Chen Ping sat cross-legged, ignoring Mad Immortal.
Seeing this, Mad Immortal followed suit and began cultivating.
In the blink of an eye, dozens of days passed!
Chen Ping had fully absorbed the malevolent energy, and his strength had reached the peak of the ninth rank of the Immortal Transformation Realm, just one step away from breaking through to the Loose Immortal Realm.
“I wonder if, after reaching the Loose Immortal Realm, my cultivation will still progress this quickly?” Chen Ping mused.
“This pagoda has no resources or immortal energy. Cultivating here is dull,” Mad Immortal complained as Chen Ping finished.
Chen Ping merely smiled, saying nothing, and led Mad Immortal out of the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda.
Meanwhile, Niu Meng, watching Chen Ping and Mad Immortal enter the pagoda, noted that only a few hours had passed outside when they emerged.
Mad Immortal, still unaware of anything unusual, asked, “We’re out, and nothing seems different. We’re still in the same place, aren’t we?”
Chen Ping smiled faintly, “Senior, how long do you think we cultivated inside the pagoda?”
Mad Immortal frowned, “A few dozen days, perhaps?”
Chen Ping nodded, “Correct, we did cultivate for dozens of days. But in the outside world, only a few hours have passed.”
“What?” Mad Immortal was stunned. “You’re not joking, are you? Is this pagoda a time artifact? Can it alter the flow of time?”
“One year outside is a hundred years inside,” Chen Ping explained.
“Damn…” Mad Immortal was utterly shocked. “You mean, my centuries in the Purgatory Field could have been just a few years with this pagoda?”
“Exactly,” Chen Ping nodded.
“Hell…” Mad Immortal stared at the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda in Chen Ping’s hand, his eyes filled with envy. “No wonder you’re so powerful at such a young age. With this treasure, while others cultivate for years, you gain centuries of progress.”
“That’s just too incredible…”
