“Father, I’ll assist you!”
Sang Lan let out a clear shout, her sword unsheathed from her waist.
Though only at the Fifth-Grade Loose Cultivator realm, she had inherited Sang Tianyang’s Shura Sword Technique. As her sword flashed, purple-gold energy transformed into a translucent dragon-shaped phantom, fiercely striking the lower back of a Tianyuan Pavilion elder.
The elder, entangled with a Shura Guard, was caught off guard by the attack from behind. He hastily turned to block, but Sang Lan’s sword cleaved through his shield, leaving web-like cracks across his shoulder armour.
“A mere junior dares to intervene!”
Another grey-robed elder roared, conjuring a ball of eerie blue flame in his palm and hurling it at Sang Lan’s face.
As the flames neared, Sang Lan spun her sword, tracing an arc that shattered the flames into sparks. With a tap of her foot, she retreated to Sang Tianyang’s side.
Gasping for breath, she scanned the battlefield, but her gaze froze, Mo Qingyun was being flung back by an invisible force, crashing towards the Liuli wall.
“Qingyun!”
Chen Ping shouted in alarm, his Dragon-Slaying Sword still sheathed. But Mo Qingyun had already steadied herself at the base of the wall.
Pale-faced, Mo Qingyun waved a hand, “Chen Ping, I’m fine… just too weak to get close.”
Her realm was like a flickering candle in the aftermath of such high-level energy, barely able to protect her heart meridians. She retreated behind a stone pillar at the battlefield’s edge, her fingers tightly clutching her clothes.
Seeing Mo Qingyun unharmed, Chen Ping felt relieved and ready to unleash his full strength!
The Grand Elder’s blade attacks grew increasingly frenzied, each strike carrying earth-shattering hatred.
Calculating that Sang Tianyang was occupied maintaining the Shura Guards’ blood essence activation, the Grand Elder unleashed all his killing moves on Chen Ping.
A blood-red blade light formed a ten-zhang giant blade, slashing down with a piercing shriek that tore through space.
Chen Ping’s feet erupted with a blast of air, his figure shifting three zhang like a phantom. The blade struck the ground, instantly reducing the Liuli tiles to dust, leaving a bone-deep gash stretching ten zhang.
“Chen Ping! Offer your life to appease my son!”
“Chen Ping! Offer your life to appease my son!”
The Grand Elder roared, the Shura totem on his blade’s hilt suddenly bursting with blood-red light. His aura surged to Ninth-Grade Loose Immortal, his blade momentum showing signs of breaking its limits, a desperate killing move fuelled by burning his origin power!
This Grand Elder was likely prepared to perish alongside Chen Ping, his son’s death leaving him with no reason to live!
“Bring it on!”
A cold glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes as he held nothing back.
With a fierce wave of his hand, two dark figures emerged from his body, the two warrior statues wielding giant axes!
As the statues appeared, they let out deafening war cries, their axe blades radiating golden runes that instantly formed three layers of defensive light shields.
The Tianyuan Pavilion Master’s pupils contracted at the sight of Chen Ping summoning two warriors, his jade fan slowing for a moment.
Sang Tianyang, shocked, remarked, “Ancient war puppets, truly remarkable!”
He had heard from Sang Lan that Chen Ping had obtained two warrior statues from those ruins, but he hadn’t expected them to be so powerful!
Blinded by hatred, the Grand Elder sneered, “Mere lifeless objects dare to stop me!”
His blade momentum unchanged, the blood-red giant blade crashed against the light shield with a “boom,” shattering the first layer. But the bronze warrior’s giant axe was already swinging with immense force towards his face.
Simultaneously, the second warrior shadowed him, its axe targeting a gap at the Grand Elder’s waist.
Chen Ping, wielding the Dragon-Slaying Sword, closed in, his sword momentum forming a triangular assault with the two warriors’ attacks.
Three distinct forces intertwined, the axe wind fierce like thunder, the blade shadow cunning like a viper, and the sword momentum sharp enough to cleave all things, instantly suppressing the Grand Elder’s blade light, forcing him to retreat step by step.
“Impossible! How do you have such means!”
The Grand Elder was furious and shocked, his brief power surge from burning his origin utterly ineffective against the three-pronged onslaught.
