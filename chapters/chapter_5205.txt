At that moment, the altar suddenly began to shake violently, the black demonic core erupting with a dazzling light, and the runes around the altar melted away rapidly like ice and snow.
A tremendous pressure surged from beneath the altar, causing the entire underground palace to tremble, as if something were about to break through the earth.
“Damn it! The seal is breaking!”
Chen Ping’s face changed drastically, “Youyue probably knew this would happen, she sent us to retrieve the demonic core just to make us break the seal!”
A deafening roar came from below the altar, the ground splitting into massive fissures, black demonic energy gushing out from the cracks, coalescing into a demonic figure dozens of metres tall.
The demonic figure wielded a giant axe, its face ferocious, none other than the ancient demon general that had been sealed!
“Hahaha… I am finally free!”
The demon general’s voice thundered like lightning, causing their eardrums to ache, “Two thousand eight hundred years, and someone still dares to break my seal!”
Hu Mazi’s face turned pale, his hand gripping the clan leader’s token trembling slightly, “This is… the ancient demon general? Its aura is terrifying!”
Chen Ping shielded Hu Mazi behind him, his spiritual energy bursting forth unrestrained, the Dragon-Slaying Sword humming and emitting sharp sword energy, “It just broke free, its strength hasn’t fully recovered, we still have a chance!”
The demon general’s gaze fell on Chen Ping, a hint of disdain flashing in its eyes, “A mere human cultivator dares to act arrogantly before me? Die!”
It swung its giant axe towards them, the black axe energy carrying a world-destroying momentum, tearing the air of the underground palace apart.
Chen Ping didn’t dare to be careless, pulling Hu Mazi and leaping aside to dodge the axe energy.
The axe energy struck the ground with a loud boom, splitting the earth into a bottomless chasm, debris flying everywhere.
“Senior, this guy’s out, possess me and take him down, he’s no match for you!”
Chen Ping hurriedly called for the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord to possess him and deal with the demon general.
But no matter how much he shouted, the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord acted as if he hadn’t heard!
“Damn it, playing dead…”
“Master Hu, find a way to reinforce the seal!” Chen Ping had no choice but to instruct Hu Mazi to reinforce it while he charged at the demon general with the Dragon-Slaying Sword, “I’ll hold it off!”
He knew that with just the two of them, defeating the ancient demon general was impossible, their only hope was to reseal it.
Hu Mazi snapped to his senses, immediately taking out talisman paper and, following the methods passed down by his ancestors, began drawing runes to reinforce the seal.
Seeing Chen Ping dare to attack, the demon general’s eyes flashed with anger, its giant axe sweeping towards Chen Ping’s waist.
Chen Ping dodged like a phantom, simultaneously unleashing the Dragon-Slaying Sword, golden sword energy raining down on the demon general.
However, the demon general’s defence was formidable, the sword energy leaving only faint white marks on its body, unable to cause any real damage.
“Useless! My demonic body is impervious to blades and spears, you think your pathetic skills can harm me?”
The demon general laughed arrogantly, swinging its axe again, forcing Chen Ping to retreat repeatedly.
Chen Ping grew anxious, he could feel the demon general’s strength recovering rapidly, if this continued, forget reinforcing the seal, both of them would die here.
At that moment, he suddenly remembered the demonic dragon’s inner core and quickly took it out from his chest.
The inner core radiated dense demonic energy, perhaps capable of temporarily suppressing the demon general.
He infused spiritual energy into the core, which instantly burst with dazzling black light, shooting towards the demon general.
Seeing the core, a trace of greed flashed in the demon general’s eyes, and it reached out to grab it.
“Now’s the chance!”
Chen Ping seized the opportunity, the Dragon-Slaying Sword turning into a streak of light, slashing towards the demon general’s arm.
