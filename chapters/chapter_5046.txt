“Elder Tong, can’t you break this stone gate formation either?”
Tianci asked Elder Tong.
“Don’t rush, this formation is somewhat peculiar and requires time.”
Elder Tong replied.
Tianci didn’t dare speak further, only waiting quietly.
Chen Ping found Elder Tong’s behaviour quite amusing, dawdling for so long.
If it were Chen Ping, he would have already broken the formation by now.
However, it wasn’t the right time for Chen Ping to act, so he could only wait.
Elder Tong stared at the glowing runes on the stone gate for a long time, then a red light emanated from his palm, slowly pressing onto the gate, the runes on it also emitting a red glow.
Before long, those runes converged together, and with a tremor, the stone gate slowly opened.
Seeing the gate open, Tianci smiled, “Elder Tong is indeed formidable, no formation can stump you.”
But the moment the formation was broken, with a tremor in the void, a woman in a white robe with long flowing hair appeared, followed by three black-robed elders.
Seeing these people, Tianci frowned.
Elder Tong’s expression also turned grim, sneering, “I didn’t expect you people from the Shura Hall would play the mantis stalking the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.”
“We just arrived and saw you open the stone gate, just good luck.”
The white-robed woman smiled faintly, then moved to lead her group through the gate.
“No entry…” Tianci immediately blocked their way.
“What? Is this ruin owned by your Tianyuan Pavilion?” the white-robed woman asked.
“But we opened this stone gate.”
Tianci said.
“So what if you opened it? I’ll enter if I want, it’s not your house.”
“Some neither-man-nor-woman like you shouldn’t meddle.”
The white-robed woman snorted coldly.
Tianci’s face flushed with anger, but this ruthless figure didn’t dare raise a hand against the woman.
Seeing this, Elder Tong pulled Tianci aside, letting them pass.
The white-robed woman led her group inside, and Tianci, face dark with anger, calmed himself before turning to Mo Qingyun, “Sister Qingyun, let’s go in too…”
Mo Qingyun nodded, following Tianci and Elder Tong inside.
Chen Ping followed suit, while the man in green hesitated but ultimately couldn’t resist the temptation and went in too.
However, once everyone entered, they were stunned, the interior of the stone gate was a chaotic void, with nothing around, even the gate they had just passed through slowly vanished behind them.
The moment the gate disappeared, the surroundings plunged into chaos.
A grey mist enveloped everyone, as if they were in a void, even the ground beneath their feet became indistinct.
“This… where are we?” the man in green paled, his voice trembling.
Tianci snorted, “Why panic? Since it’s a ruin, it naturally has its mysteries.”
He turned to Elder Tong, whispering, “Elder Tong, can you discern anything?”
Elder Tong narrowed his eyes, a faint red light glowing from his palm, seemingly sensing the surrounding energy fluctuations.
After a moment, he said gravely, “This chaos isn’t an illusion but a true spatial rift, we’ve been transported to the core of the ruin.”
“Spatial rift?” the white-robed woman frowned slightly, “So, we can’t get out for now?”
“Hmph, since we’re here, why rush to leave?” Tianci sneered, “This ruin, left by an ancient sect, must hold great treasures, whoever finds them first claims them!”
With that, he ignored the others, leading Elder Tong and Mo Qingyun straight into the depths of the chaos.
