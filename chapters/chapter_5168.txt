The Seventh Hall Master stared blankly as his natal treasure was destroyed, his body trembling as if struck by lightning, barely able to stand.
Looking into Chen Ping’s eyes, which seemed to pierce through everything, a wave of despair surged in his heart for the first time.
This guy… what kind of monster is he?
“Seventh Hall Master, what other tricks do you have?” Chen Ping’s voice carried a hint of laziness, as if he were watching a dull play. “Stop holding back, show me everything you’ve got. Let’s see just how much the peak strength of the Seventh Hall weighs.”
“You… you’re going too far!” The Seventh Hall Master, driven to a corner, flashed a ruthless glint in his eyes. “Since you’re courting death, don’t blame me for using the forbidden secret technique!”
He bit his tongue sharply, spitting a mouthful of essence blood onto his chest, his hands swiftly forming an intricate, mysterious seal.
In an instant, his aura surged wildly. His cultivation, already at the peak of the Loose Immortal Realm, showed faint signs of breaking through. Golden flames enveloped his body, and eerie patterns appeared on his face.
“This is… ‘Heavenly God Sacrifice’!” Huo Jingjing exclaimed in shock.
As a member of the Divine Hall, Huo Jingjing naturally knew the power of the Heavenly God Sacrifice.
Hu Mazi’s eyes narrowed, and he stepped forward to help, but Chen Ping stopped him with a glance.
Chen Ping looked at the Seventh Hall Master, whose aura had skyrocketed, showing no trace of fear. Instead, a spark of interest flickered in his eyes. “Oh? Heavenly God Sacrifice? That’s a bit intriguing.”
At this moment, the Seventh Hall Master resembled a heavenly god, golden flames roaring around him.
With a ferocious roar, he threw a punch at Chen Ping.
This punch contained all the power of his burning life essence. The space itself warped under the force, faintly forming the shadow of a heavenly god on his fist, radiating a pressure capable of destroying heaven and earth.
“Chen Ping, die!”
Yet, facing this punch that could make any Loose Immortal Realm expert quail, Chen Ping merely raised his left hand, fingers spread, and reached slowly toward the incoming force.
“Pfft!”
There was no earth-shattering clash, only a soft sound.
Chen Ping’s palm effortlessly caught the Seventh Hall Master’s fist. The devastating force dissolved instantly in his grasp, like a clay ox sinking into the sea.
The Seventh Hall Master: “…”
His eyes widened, staring at his fist, so easily caught.
Feeling the life force draining from his body like a tide, and the vast, all-consuming power emanating from Chen Ping’s palm, despair overwhelmed him like a tsunami.
How is this possible?
He had burned his life essence, unleashed his ultimate trump card, and yet… he hadn’t even touched the hem of his opponent’s clothes?
Chen Ping looked at his terrified expression, a cold smirk curling his lips. “Seventh Hall Master, is this the extent of your strength?”
With a slight flick of his wrist, a crisp “crack” sounded.
The Seventh Hall Master felt a sharp pain shoot through his arm as every bone shattered instantly. Screaming, he was flung away by Chen Ping, crashing heavily into a stone pillar in the hall.
“Pfft…”
The Seventh Hall Master spat out a mouthful of blood. The burning life essence in his body became chaotic, and the Heavenly God Sacrifice state collapsed instantly, leaving him utterly weakened.
Struggling to rise from the rubble, he watched Chen Ping approach step by step, his eyes filled with utter fear and despair.
He finally understood that the gap between him and this man wasn’t a matter of cultivation realms, but a chasm as vast as that between an ant and a dragon!
“You… what do you want?” His voice was hoarse, tinged with a sob, stripped of all the dignity of a Hall Master. “I… I apologise! I’ll apologise to the Eighth Hall! I’ll make amends to Huo Zhao! Please, spare me…”
The others from the Seventh Hall, seeing their master beg for mercy, lowered their heads in silence.
They had initially thought of rushing forward together, but after witnessing Chen Ping’s true strength, they all shrank back in fear.
