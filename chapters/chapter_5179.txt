“What is the Evil Path Hall?” Chen Ping asked, somewhat puzzled.
“An organisation, one that specialises in collecting spirits. I didn’t expect these people to have come to the Third Heaven!”
The Seventh Hall Master said, his face full of shock.
Hearing this, Chen Ping realised that the mysterious organisation Yun Wuya mentioned was the Evil Path Hall.
“Is this Evil Path Hall very powerful?” Chen Ping asked.
“Very powerful. It’s said that the Evil Path Hall was established thousands of years ago, always collecting spirits wherever there are large-scale deaths of cultivators or battlefields.”
“It’s said that during a sect conflict in the Ninth Heaven, where tens of thousands died, people from the Evil Path Hall appeared.”
The Seventh Hall Master explained.
“Oh?” Chen Ping frowned, “So, doesn’t that mean the Evil Path Hall’s strength is at least greater than that of the Ninth Heaven?”
“Of course, the Evil Path Hall is a very mysterious organisation. Their presence can be seen almost everywhere, but they never engage in conflicts, only collecting spirits for unknown purposes!”
“This time, clashing with you, I don’t know what it’s about!”
The Seventh Hall Master said, perplexed.
Chen Ping, of course, knew that they were after the soul of the Red Cloud Demon Lord. He refused to hand it over, so the fight broke out!
At that moment, Chen Ping suddenly thought of the token. It seemed that the Evil Path Hall’s collection of spirits might be related to the token!
Chen Ping wanted to ask the Seventh Hall Master, but he might not know, and the fact that he had the token shouldn’t be known by too many people, so Chen Ping didn’t speak up.
“What did the Evil Path Hall send you?” Hu Mazi asked in a deep voice.
“You Wuxie, the Great Elder of the Evil Path Hall, is personally leading people to the Seventh Hall!” The Seventh Hall Master’s voice trembled, “He also declared that either we hand you over, or they’ll flatten the entire Seventh Hall!”
The Seventh Hall Master took a deep breath, his eyes filled with despair, “Accompanying him are the Eight Great Consecrators and the Twelve Blood Guards! With this lineup, even if all the sects in the Third Heaven joined forces, they might not be able to stop them!”
Chen Ping’s fingertips brushed the hilt of the Dragon-Slaying Sword, his gaze eerily calm, “It seems they’re really desperate.”
“Chen Ping, why don’t you leave first!” Huo Jingjing urged, “The Third Heaven is vast. If you hide, they might not find you!”
The Seventh Hall Master also nodded quickly, “Chen Ping, as long as there’s life, there’s hope! The Evil Path Hall is powerful, no need to confront them head-on!”
“As long as you’re not here, the Evil Path Hall won’t do anything to me, after all, I have the Divine Hall and the entire Divine Clan behind me.”
Chen Ping shook his head, looking towards the northwest.
The sky there was now covered with inky clouds, faintly flickering with lightning, and an unsettling pressure was rapidly approaching.
“It’s too late to leave,” he said softly, “Since You Wuxie dares to come in person, he must have set up an inescapable net. Besides…”
He paused, a cold glint of killing intent flashing in his eyes, “I, Chen Ping, never leave my troubles for others. They’re looking for me, so I’ll wait for them right here.”
Outside the Seventh Hall, the eerie winds of the Black Wind Abyss grew more ferocious, whipping sand and gravel against the green stone tiles of the hall, producing a sharp “crackling” sound, like the drumbeat of death.
In the stone chamber, the Seventh Hall Master’s voice trembled uncontrollably. The communication jade slip in his hand had already been crushed to dust, the powder slipping through his fingers.
Huo Jingjing tightly gripped Mo Qingyun’s hand, their knuckles white, their faces drained of colour. Only Hu Mazi tried to remain calm, but he couldn’t help glancing outside repeatedly, his Adam’s apple bobbing nervously.
Chen Ping stood with his hands behind his back at the stone gate, his gaze piercing through the thick rock wall, fixed on the roiling black clouds on the horizon.
The spiritual energy around him was like a dormant beast, seemingly calm but ready to strike.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword hummed softly in its sheath, as if sensing the impending battle, its blade emitting a faint golden glow.
