“Emperor Lin, I’m here to assist you…”
At that moment, Wuji Daoist sped towards them, holding the head of the red-haired old ghost in his hand!
Seeing Wuji Daoist arrive, Lin Chong let out a long sigh of relief!
He knew that if the fight dragged on, he wouldn’t be able to hold out much longer!
The consecutive battles had already drained most of his strength!
“Daoist, be careful. This kid’s nether corpses are formidable, and you need to watch out for his dirty tricks!” Lin Chong warned Wuji Daoist.
“I understand!” Wuji Daoist nodded.
Ming Shao had been biding his time all along. Though Wuji Daoist had just killed the red-haired old ghost, it must have taken a toll on his strength as well!
“Another one seeking death? Perfect…” Ming Shao cackled with a sinister grin.
As for the red-haired old ghost’s death, Ming Shao didn’t care in the slightest!
These were mere underlings of the Four Nether Prefectures—dead or alive, it made no difference to him!
Wuji Daoist wielded his whisk and began fighting the nether corpses!
But the moment they clashed, he felt the strain. The opponent’s nether corpses were indeed too powerful, and there were so many of them!
Wuji Daoist could only grit his teeth and hold on!
Ming Shao, meanwhile, stood atop his bone warship, calmly observing everything.
He could simply wait until everyone was exhausted and then finish them off one by one, like a cat toying with mice!
Only when the mice were utterly spent would the cat finally devour them!
“Mr. Chen, we’re here…”
Li Chunfeng and Nan Batian arrived as well. Though they looked somewhat dishevelled, they had managed to slay the red-robed old ghost and the red-faced old ghost!
“You two, go help Wuji Daoist and buy as much time as you can,” Chen Ping instructed Li Chunfeng and Nan Batian.
The two nodded and immediately joined the fray!
With their assistance, the pressure on Wuji Daoist eased considerably, but victory still seemed out of reach for the three of them alone!
Having just fought a major battle, they were now struggling against these nether corpses!
In contrast, Ming Shao watched the group with a smug smile!
He hadn’t even made a move yet. If he did, Wuji Daoist and the others would surely fall in an instant!
Chen Ping clenched his teeth, pushing the Heart-Calming Technique to its limits to recover as fast as possible!
He had once thought that with Sun-Moon City on his side, along with having recruited Li Chunfeng and Nan Batian, he’d be invincible in the Celestial Realm!
But now, facing the Four Nether Prefectures, he was already struggling this much!
And then there was the Fire Incineration Sect to consider. Chen Ping felt a headache coming on. With his current abilities, could he really rescue the Artifact Refining Sect’s leader from the hands of the Celestial Realm’s top power, the Fire Incineration Sect?
The chaotic battle raged on, and Wuwang Land teetered on the brink of collapse. If not for the support of the Heaven-Ascending Ladder, it might have shattered and vanished long ago!
At that moment, at the very top of the Heaven-Ascending Ladder, a boy of seventeen or eighteen sat on the final step, holding a treasured sword in his hand!
Behind the boy stood a white-haired old man, smiling faintly, his body radiating the power of the Heavenly Dao!
“Master, these guys aren’t climbing the Heaven-Ascending Ladder to train. Instead, they’re fighting each other. If they end up damaging the ladder, what should we do?” the boy asked the old man.
“Don’t worry, it won’t break. After this, we’ll stop guiding cultivators from the Celestial Realm. They’re a bunch of fools—let them cultivate and ascend on their own!” the old man said, shaking his head with a hint of disappointment.
“That Ming Shao guy is way too full of himself. I want to teach him a lesson,” the boy said, clearly annoyed by Ming Shao.
“No, you mustn’t…” the old man quickly intervened.
“Master, are you afraid of the Four Nether Prefectures too?” the boy asked, puzzled.
“The Four Nether Prefectures are nothing. I could wipe them out with a single breath,” the old man said disdainfully. Then, glancing at Chen Ping, he added, “That Chen kid, though—he’s not someone to mess with. If he climbs the ladder, go easy on him…”
The boy: “…”
