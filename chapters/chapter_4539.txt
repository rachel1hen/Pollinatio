This gap in strength made many people dumbfounded!
After all, many people had never really seen Chen Ping’s strength!
“Heavenly Fate ……” Patriarch Zhou and Tian Luo’s eyes immediately turned red when they saw this!
Zuo Tianzheng frowned slightly and also appeared to have thought!
While that Luo Ta coldly smiled, “This kid, a little interesting ……”
“Kid, return my disciple’s life ……”
Patriarch Zhou’s eyes were scarlet, and a sword instantly appeared in his hand, charging towards Chen Ping!
Seeing this, Tian Luo also raised his sword and went on, the two of them attacking towards Chen Ping together!
Patriarch Zhou’s sword exuded a biting cold light, his sword momentum was like a raging storm, each move contained a powerful fluctuation of spiritual energy.
Tian Luo, on the other hand, was agile, weaving around like a ghost, looking for the right moment to attack.
Chen Ping looked cold and grim as he stood still with his Dragon Cutting Sword in his hand.
His eyes revealed incomparable firmness and confidence, as if the enemies in front of him could not pose a threat to him at all.
Patriarch Zhou was the first to rush in front of Chen Ping, and the sword in his hand viciously chopped down with a furious force.
Before the sword arrived, the powerful sword qi had already caused a crack to appear on the ground.
Chen Ping did not panic, slightly sidestepped and easily dodged the blow.
Patriarch Zhou missed the blow and immediately changed his stance, his sword swept out horizontally in an attempt to cut Chen Ping off at the waist.
Chen Ping’s eyes stared, and the Dragon Slashing Sword in his hand swiftly swung out, colliding with Patriarch Zhou’s sword.
“Dang!”
A crisp impact resounded through the sky, the powerful impact caused Patriarch Zhou to take a few steps back, while Chen Ping remained motionless.
Patriarch Zhou was shocked in his heart, he did not expect Chen Ping, a cultivator of the ninth rank of the Ferrying Realm, to be able to fight head on against him, an expert of the fourth rank of the Mahayana Realm, and still look so relaxed!
However, at this time, Patriarch Zhou had already been overwhelmed by anger and could not care much about it, and once again swung his sword to attack Chen Ping.
Tian Luo also took the opportunity to attack from the side at this time, his sword was as tricky as a poisonous snake, stabbing straight at Chen Ping’s vital parts.
Chen Ping snorted coldly, his body turned slightly, and his Dragon Cutting Sword stabbed out like lightning, accurately blocking Tian Luo’s attack.
Tian Luo only felt a huge force coming from the sword, causing his arm to go numb.
The three of them instantly battled into a ball, sword shadows crisscrossing and spiritual energy overflowing.
The people around them were nervously watching the fierce battle, not daring to utter a single breath.
They were shocked by Chen Ping’s strength, a cultivator of the ninth rank of the Ferrying Realm was actually able to fight against Patriarch Zhou, who was of the fourth rank of the Mahayana Realm, and Tian Luo, who was of the second rank of the Mahayana Realm.
Chen Ping became more and more courageous as he fought, the Dragon Slashing Sword seemed to have a life in his hands as the sword became more and more powerful.
In Chen Ping’s hands, the sword shadows flashed like stars, dazzling people.
Although Patriarch Zhou and Tian Luo were in a high realm, they gradually felt overwhelmed under Chen Ping’s attacks.
“Damn, how is this brat so strong?”Patriarch Zhou cursed in his heart.
He was beginning to regret that he had followed him, but there was no turning back now, so he could only continue to fight with a stiff upper lip.
Tian Luo also realised how powerful Chen Ping was, and a hint of fear flashed in his eyes.
However, he knew that if he retreated at this point, the only thing that awaited them was death.
Thus, he gritted his teeth and raised his sword once again, joining Sovereign Zhou in launching a more violent attack on Chen Ping.
“It’s no fun, I won’t play with you guys anymore!”
After Chen Ping finished speaking, he did not hesitate to swing his sword out towards Tian Luo, the Dragon Slashing Sword stabbing out like lightning.
Tian Luo did not have time to react at all, only feeling a coldness in his chest, the Dragon Beheading Sword had pierced through his chest.
His eyes widened with disbelief as a mouthful of blood spurted out of his mouth and he slowly collapsed.
“Tian Luo!”Patriarch Zhou cried out in grief.
His heart was filled with anger and despair as he looked at his dead disciple, but he knew that now was not the time to grieve, he had to resolve Chen Ping as soon as possible, or else he too would be killed.
Patriarch Zhou wielded his sword once again and charged towards Chen Ping, his sword momentum becoming even more frantic, as if he wanted to break Chen Ping into pieces.
