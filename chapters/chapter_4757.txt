Lin Kefan suddenly took a step forward, and in the next moment, a bolt of lightning erupted from his body, shooting into the sky. In an instant, the entire hall was enveloped in a web of crackling lightning.
Seeing this, Chen Ping and the others quickly retreated, distancing themselves from the area engulfed by the lightning.
“Child’s play…”
The Tenth Hall Master sneered, then waved his hand. A boundless black blade appeared, and with a single slash, it severed the漫天雷电 in an instant!
A force of apocalyptic destruction erupted!
The lightning vanished, and Lin Kefan’s figure was sent flying backward, stumbling dozens of steps before he could steady himself.
Chen Ping and the others frowned slightly at the sight.
“Fourth Brother-in-law, you…”
Chen Ping wanted to persuade Lin Kefan, but before he could finish his sentence—
Lin Kefan transformed into a bolt of lightning and disappeared from his original position in a flash!
The Tenth Hall Master, seeing this, swung the black blade in his hand forward with a fierce motion.
Swish!
A black light suddenly descended from the sky, tearing through the void with brutal force. The lightning Lin Kefan had transformed into was shattered on the spot!
Lin Kefan’s body was sent flying once more, his face pale as a sheet.
Meanwhile, the Tenth Hall Master flipped his palm, and the black blade in his hand transformed into a swirling black mist, coiling around him like a living entity.
“What a remarkable spiritual weapon…”
Lin Kefan’s eyes were filled with envy.
It was clear that the black blade wielded by the Tenth Hall Master could change forms at will, indicating that it already housed a weapon spirit—one that had even developed its own intelligence.
The Tenth Hall Master coldly stared at Lin Kefan. “The heavenly lightning of the Ascension Ladder is nothing special. It’s just as ordinary as I expected…”
“Fourth Brother-in-law, are you alright?”
Chen Ping called out to Lin Kefan.
“I’m not dead yet. I can hold on a little longer, no problem!” Lin Kefan spat out a mouthful of blood, his eyes fierce as he glared at the Tenth Hall Master.
“Good. Hold on for a bit longer. We’ll take care of the rest of the Tenth Hall’s members!”
Chen Ping said.
Lin Kefan nodded, then transformed into a bolt of lightning once more, charging straight at the Tenth Hall Master.
Seeing this, Chen Ping shouted, “Attack! Wipe out the rest of the Tenth Hall first!”
Upon hearing this, Xuan Bin and the others also sprang into action, rushing toward the members of the Tenth Hall.
The Tenth Hall Master’s brow furrowed, and he shouted, “Stay sharp, everyone! Destroy these intruders, and I’ll personally recommend you for rewards at the main hall!”
After saying this, the Tenth Hall Master charged straight at Chen Ping.
He understood the principle of擒贼先擒王 (capture the leader first to crush the enemy).
These people had been brought here by Chen Ping. If he could kill Chen Ping, the rest would naturally collapse and scatter.
Chen Ping, holding the Dragon-Slaying Sword, watched as the Tenth Hall Master charged toward him and couldn’t help but smile inwardly.
“You little brat, last time I was afraid of you, and you got to show off quite a bit. But today, I’m going to teach you how to behave!”
With that, Chen Ping swung the Dragon-Slaying Sword.
The sword’s light cut through the air like a dragon, slashing toward the Tenth Hall Master in an instant.
Although the Tenth Hall Master reacted quickly, he was still a step too slow. The sword’s energy severed his left arm, and blood gushed out like a fountain.
“Ah—!”
The Tenth Hall Master let out a piercing scream, staggering backward, his face turning as pale as paper.
“My son!”
The Tenth Hall Master’s eyes blazed with fury, his previously calm expression twisting into one of rage.
The black blade in his hand trembled violently, transforming into a black lightning bolt that shot straight toward Chen Ping!
“Chen Ping, you’re seeking death!”
The Tenth Hall Master’s voice thundered, shaking the entire hall.
Chen Ping felt the overwhelming killing intent emanating from the Tenth Hall Master and felt a slight chill in his heart. However, he didn’t retreat. Instead, he tightened his grip on the Dragon-Slaying Sword and charged forward.
“Clang—!”
The Dragon-Slaying Sword collided with the black blade, producing a deafening metallic clang.
Chen Ping felt his arm go numb, and he was forced back several steps. The Tenth Hall Master, however, stood firm, clearly far superior in strength.
