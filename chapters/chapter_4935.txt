Having had his fun, Chen Ping leapt down from Da Hu’s body.
Da Hu, thoroughly toyed with, was seething with rage, roaring loudly like a maddened bull.
He swung a fierce punch at Chen Ping, but this time, Chen Ping didn’t dodge with his agile movements.
Instead, Chen Ping stood his ground, grabbing Da Hu’s fist with his palm. Their hands collided with a thunderous crash.
In an instant, a dazzling light burst forth, and powerful shockwaves radiated from the point of impact, knocking spectators to the ground, forcing them to shield their eyes.
When the light faded, the crowd was stunned to see Da Hu’s massive fist firmly gripped by Chen Ping’s hand, utterly immobile.
“Impossible!”
Bao Hu’s eyes widened, his voice trembling with disbelief.
Da Hu’s physical strength was unmatched in the black market. In past fights, he had always crushed his opponents single-handedly. When had he ever faced such a formidable foe?
Roaring, Da Hu’s muscles tensed, veins bulging as he struggled to break free from Chen Ping’s hold.
Chen Ping merely smirked coldly, twisting his wrist with sudden force, redirecting Da Hu’s fist.
With a swift kick to Da Hu’s knee, a sickening *crack* echoed. Da Hu’s towering frame collapsed to the ground.
The arena fell deathly silent, jaws dropping in disbelief.
No one had ever witnessed such overwhelming physical power, capable of dominating an opponent of such immense size.
“My turn,” Chen Ping said softly, his voice reverberating like thunder in the crowd’s ears.
In a flash, he vanished from his spot.
The next moment, a solid punch landed squarely on Da Hu’s face, sending him crashing into the arena’s boundary wall, leaving a massive human-shaped dent.
Da Hu struggled to rise, but his body felt like it was falling apart, every movement laced with excruciating pain.
Chen Ping strolled over, looking down at him. “Is that all you’ve got?”
Bao Hu’s face darkened, roaring, “Da Hu, get up and finish him!”
Gritting his teeth, Da Hu tried to stand, only to be pinned down by Chen Ping’s foot on his chest.
With a slight press, Da Hu felt as though a mountain was crushing him, his breathing laboured, his vision fading.
“Surrender,” Chen Ping said.
Da Hu glared defiantly but knew he was powerless against this seemingly frail opponent.
He nodded reluctantly, conceding defeat.
Chen Ping stepped back, and Da Hu collapsed like a heap of mud.
The crowd erupted in deafening gasps, their eyes fixed on Chen Ping with a mix of fear and awe.
“Anyone else?” Chen Ping scanned the arena, his piercing gaze sweeping the room. “I’ll take on ten at once.”
Bao Hu’s face twisted with fury. Gnashing his teeth, he spat, “Fine, kid, you’ve got guts! Let’s see how tough you really are. Everyone, attack!”
With a wave of his hand, ten elite fighters from Bao Hu’s crew leapt onto the stage.
Their heavy footsteps thundered like war drums.
Each was a master of physical cultivation, the shortest over two metres tall, their muscled bodies gleaming with a metallic sheen.
They fanned out, encircling Chen Ping, their eyes glinting with bloodlust.
Bai Yi’s face paled, shouting anxiously, “Son-in-law, no! There are too many of them. You can’t take them all alone!”
“Keep a low profile when you’re out. Acting this cocky, even I can’t bail you out,” Bai Yi fretted. Though Chen Ping’s physical prowess and strength were extraordinary, taking on ten at once was beyond absurd.
