“Father, my brother has been captured. We must find a way to rescue him. If it comes to it, we’ll storm Flying Tiger City and fight to the death.”
Niu Li said to Niu Gadfly.
“There’s no need to rush. Although they’ve taken your brother, they’re merely trying to blackmail me to gain access to the treasure land and extort some resources.”
“They won’t do anything to your brother. Killing him would bring them no benefit.”
Niu Gadfly wasn’t worried at the time. He knew Flying Tiger City didn’t intend to kill, only to use his son as leverage.
“We can’t just leave him there, can we?” Niu Li said.
“Who said we’re not saving him? We just wait. Flying Tiger City will contact us on their own.”
Niu Gadfly glanced at Niu Li and said, “Go back to bed. This isn’t your concern.”
Though reluctant, Niu Li turned and left.
“Old Niu, where exactly is this treasure land? Can you take me to see it?”
Chen Ping was very curious about the treasure land.
“Brother, the treasure land only opens once every thousand years. It’s not time yet. If you force your way in, you’ll face Heavenly Law suppression, and your lifespan will drain significantly.”
Niu Gadfly explained.
“Lifespan drain?” Chen Ping was surprised. “What kind of Heavenly Law suppression is this?”
“Take me to see it first. I won’t necessarily go in.”
Seeing Chen Ping’s insistence, Niu Gadfly nodded, “Alright, I’ll take you to have a look, but please don’t be reckless. If you go in and can’t get out alive, it’ll be trouble.”
“Don’t worry, I know my limits!” Chen Ping nodded.
Niu Gadfly led Chen Ping to the treasure land, while Mad Immortal and Bai Yi stayed behind at the City Lord’s Mansion.
Chen Ping followed Niu Gadfly, flying for several hours until they seemed to leave the entire beast clan territory before finally stopping.
Seeing the barren land around them, Chen Ping frowned slightly, “Is this still Rhino City’s territory?”
They had flown thousands of miles. If this was still Rhino City’s land, it was far too vast.
“Yes, this is still Rhino City’s territory, but any further, and it’s Flying Tiger City’s land. This treasure land is what Flying Tiger City often fights us over.”
“But there’s still over three hundred years until the treasure land opens. Why is Flying Tiger City so impatient now?”
Niu Gadfly was puzzled. Why didn’t Flying Tiger City wait until the treasure land was about to open before acting?
“Come on, let’s go down and see.”
With that, Chen Ping descended first.
Niu Gadfly followed closely. As they landed, Chen Ping noticed a visible mark on the ground just a few miles away, clearly etched into the earth.
It was as if a dividing line existed. The ground’s colour was different on each side.
The soil within the treasure land was a faint red, like blood that had seeped into the earth and dried over time.
Chen Ping walked toward the treasure land. Niu Gadfly tried to stop him, but Chen Ping had already stepped inside.
The moment he entered, Chen Ping’s brows furrowed tightly.
He could clearly feel his strength and lifespan draining away.
Chen Ping quickly retreated, and the sensation vanished instantly.
“It’s really like that…” Chen Ping said, frowning.
“Brother, why would I lie to you? Normally, no one dares set foot on this land.”
“Let’s go back. Wasting too much strength and life here isn’t worth it.”
Niu Gadfly urged Chen Ping.
But Chen Ping didn’t move. He stared at the treasure land ahead and asked, “You said this is Heavenly Law suppression. If we could break this Heavenly Law, would it be fine?”
