Soon, a light appeared before their eyes, and Chen Ping was thrilled!
He thought they were about to escape this wretched place. Having just arrived in the Heavenly Realm, he hadn’t seen a glimpse of it before being tossed into a cage!
Chen Ping was dying to know what the Heavenly Realm looked like!
After a few more breaths, a flash of white light blinded them, and their feet finally touched solid ground!
They were no longer floating in mid-air!
Chen Ping glanced around, then his eyes narrowed, his face darkening!
They hadn’t escaped to the vast lands of the Heavenly Realm but had landed inside a palace!
The palace was lined with oil lamps, their wicks flickering like dancing sprites!
At the far end stood a high platform, with a figure seated atop it!
The entire palace felt oppressively grim, and the figure on the platform radiated a sinister yin aura!
“This must be the master of the cages!” Xiu Rui said.
“Probably!”
Chen Ping nodded!
“You lot dare to break the cages and escape punishment? Truly audacious!”
“You haven’t earned ascension, yet you took shortcuts to the Heavenly Realm. That defies the Heavenly Dao, and you must be punished!”
A commanding voice boomed from the platform!
A crushing wave of pressure bore down on Chen Ping and his group!
“Piss off, who do you think you are, doling out Heavenly Dao’s punishment?”
Hu Mazi roared, waving a hand, and the pressure vanished instantly!
“Hm?” A puzzled sound came from the figure!
“Who are you, exactly? If you’re enforcing Heavenly Dao’s punishment, why target only human monks?”
Chen Ping’s icy gaze locked onto the figure as he demanded answers!
“I punish who I want, what’s it to you?”
The figure, clearly annoyed, unleashed an even stronger wave of pressure!
Hu Mazi was about to curse and strike, but Chen Ping stopped him, “Master Hu, stand back. Let me deal with this poser!”
With that, Chen Ping stood his ground, golden light sparking at his fingertips. He pointed casually!
“Immortal Finger…”
*Boom!*
The moment the pressure met Chen Ping’s Immortal Finger, it exploded!
The palace trembled, the terrifying energy nearly bringing the whole structure down!
“You know immortal techniques?” The figure sounded baffled!
Then the figure leapt from the platform, sending blood-red blades slicing toward Chen Ping!
Chen Ping’s Indestructible Golden Body flared up, and he drew his Dragon-Slaying Sword, swinging wildly!
*Bang, bang, bang…*
He blocked every blade, reducing them to dust!
After deflecting them, Chen Ping swung his sword, unleashing a ferocious blast of sword qi straight at the figure!
Xiu Rui watched, eyes wide, too shocked to speak!
A first-tier Immortal Transformation monk pulling off moves this terrifying!
“Not bad!”
Seeing Chen Ping’s strike, the figure waved a hand, conjuring a shield that blocked the sword qi effortlessly!
Chen Ping raised his sword for another go, but Hu Mazi cut in, “Stop, you’re no match for him!”
It was clear the figure hadn’t gone all out, while Chen Ping was already at his limit!
The gap in their strength was too wide, no point fighting on!
Chen Ping’s eyes were cold, but he knew this was the Heavenly Realm, not the Mortal Realm. Here, any random bloke could outmatch him!
The difference was stark, he was still a monk, while the other might already be an immortal, even a Loose Immortal was leagues beyond a mere monk!
“In all my years, you’re the most gifted I’ve ever seen.”
The figure on the platform spoke!
“Flattery won’t help. If you don’t explain yourself today, I’ll tear down your palace and cripple your cultivation!”
Chen Ping said icily!
Xiu Rui stared at Chen Ping, dumbfounded, wondering what gave him the nerve to talk like that!
