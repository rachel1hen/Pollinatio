“Mo Qingchen?” Chen Ping’s eyes flickered, “Who is he?”
Mo Qingyun sighed and said, “He’s my cousin, his parents died early, and my parents raised him single-handedly.”
“But this guy doesn’t know gratitude, because I’m a girl, he’s always coveted my father’s position as clan leader, plotting to seize power.”
Chen Ping pondered, such an ungrateful wretch truly didn’t deserve to live!
“Let’s go, I’ll return to the Mo family with you, if Tianyuan Pavilion keeps pressuring, I’ll wipe them out!”
Chen Ping decided to accompany Mo Qingyun back to the Mo family!
He instructed Hu Mazi to stay at the Eight Halls for now, with Hu Mazi there, if the Eight Halls were attacked, he could maintain the array for a short time to keep it intact!
After arranging everything for the Eight Halls, Chen Ping followed Mo Qingyun to the Mo family!
The Second Heaven was more than ten times larger than the First Heaven, and the Eight Halls were tens of thousands of miles away from the Mo family.
Fortunately, the Second Heaven had many teleportation arrays, requiring only a few transfers to reach the destination, otherwise, traveling on foot would take at least ten days or half a month!
…
Tianyuan Pavilion!
In a grand hall, Elder Tong stood quietly, before him sat a white-bearded old man, dressed in a wide, flowing robe, with a Star Map of Heaven and Earth placed in front of him.
The old man gazed at each glowing star on the map, his expression sometimes grave, sometimes relaxed.
Elder Tong stood to the side, not daring to say a word!
Suddenly, the old man waved his hand toward a shining star, and it instantly dimmed.
But as that star faded, another star lit up elsewhere.
This caused the old man to furrow his brows tightly!
Elder Tong stood there, hardly daring to breathe, his body slightly bowed, standing respectfully!
“Chen Ping…” Suddenly, the old man spoke, saying Chen Ping’s name!
“Yes!” Elder Tong nodded!
“Gantian Sect?” The old man spoke again!
“Yes!” Elder Tong nodded again.
“Tell me about it…” The old man asked!
Elder Tong then recounted the entire matter in meticulous detail, leaving nothing out, as if replaying it exactly!
After listening, the old man’s expression remained calm, “So, not only did this Chen Ping injure your people, but he also obtained two coffins?”
“Yes!” Elder Tong nodded!
“Do you know anything about those two warrior statues?”
“No!” Elder Tong shook his head!
“Then tell me, should we seek revenge on this Chen Ping?” The old man finally looked up at Elder Tong and asked.
“Everything follows the Pavilion Master’s arrangements.”
Elder Tong was cautious!
The old man chuckled upon hearing this, “Elder Tong, as an elder of Tianyuan Pavilion, you have your own authority, you don’t need to defer to me on everything.”
“Though you earned your elder position through your mastery of arrays, your elder status carries real power, not just a title.”
“Don’t belittle yourself, show the demeanor and attitude of an elder!”
Hearing this, Elder Tong hurriedly said, “Thank you for your guidance, Pavilion Master, I think we should teach that Chen Ping a lesson, and the Mo family can’t be spared either, that Mo family girl openly humiliated Tianci, making our Tianyuan Pavilion lose face.”
The old man nodded, “Have you spoken to the Mo family?”
“I have, I told them to hand over the girl, or we won’t be polite with the Mo family!” Elder Tong said!
“Well done, the Mo family should indeed give us an explanation!” The old man nodded, then continued, “As for that Chen Ping, I think we should let others deal with him, as long as word spreads about the treasure he possesses, someone will make a move.”
“Didn’t you say the people from Shura Hall were also at the scene? Perhaps they’ll take action.”
“We’ll sit back and watch, this Chen Ping can fight above his level, even surpassing Tianci, which proves he’s no ordinary person, perhaps from a greater family or force.”
“I understand!” Elder Tong nodded!
He knew the Pavilion Master intended to let others do the dirty work!
