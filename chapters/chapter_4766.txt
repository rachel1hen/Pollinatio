Huo Qing had just come to a halt when, in an instant, he transformed into a streak of light, charging once more towards Cang Yue!
The terrifying pressure swept through the entire Ten Halls, suffocating everyone in its wake!
Cang Yue’s eyes narrowed as he spoke to Xuan Bin, who was about to intervene, “Don’t move. Let me handle this myself…”
Gritting his teeth, Cang Yue leapt into the air, shooting like a cannonball towards Huo Qing!
Huo Qing and Cang Yue clashed, and in the short term, it seemed difficult to determine a winner.
At this moment, the Ten Hall Master and Elder Qian, along with the Ten Hall’s forces, were staring intently at Chen Ping and his companions.
Chen Ping frowned slightly. He needed to find a way to restrain Elder Qian. Only by doing so could he confront the Ten Hall Master directly.
Otherwise, with Elder Qian’s ability to foresee the future, they would be at a severe disadvantage, as every move they made would be anticipated.
“Miss… Miss Hua, do you know how to set up an illusion array?” Chen Ping asked Hua Yueying.
Every time he called her “Miss Hua,” Chen Ping felt a bit awkward.
“I can set up an illusion array, but what do you plan to use it for, Mr. Chen?” Hua Yueying asked, puzzled.
“We’ll use the illusion array to confuse them and make our escape!” Chen Ping explained.
Hua Yueying nodded in understanding and began chanting incantations to set up the illusion array.
Elder Qian, however, sneered coldly. “They’re setting up an illusion array to try and escape. Keep your eyes sharp, and don’t trust everything you see.”
“Understood!” the Ten Hall Master replied.
Soon, the illusion array was complete. As Hua Yueying activated the formation, the scenery within the Ten Halls began to shift rapidly.
Before long, everyone felt as though they were standing on a mountain in the Heavenly Realm.
“Chen Ping, do you really think a simple illusion array and a change of scenery will let you escape from me?” the Ten Hall Master taunted.
Chen Ping remained silent, continuing to weave hand seals. The void around them trembled.
Hua Yueying looked at Chen Ping in surprise. She didn’t understand why they were now standing on a mountain in the Heavenly Realm. This was far beyond what her illusion array could achieve.
*Buzz…*
As Chen Ping completed his hand seals, a low hum resonated through the air.
“Fourth Brother, I’ll leave Elder Qian to you. I’ve set up a formation around us, so his divination abilities won’t work here,” Chen Ping said to Lin Kefan.
Lin Kefan hesitated for a moment, then tentatively struck out at Elder Qian with a palm strike.
A bolt of lightning suddenly appeared, startling Elder Qian.
Elder Qian frowned, his eyes filled with surprise. It was clear that Chen Ping was right—Elder Qian’s divination abilities were ineffective within this space.
“Even without my divination, a mere child like you is no match for me!” Elder Qian scoffed, his tone dripping with disdain.
Disdain was a hallmark of the divine race.
Lin Kefan fought with all his might, clashing with Elder Qian.
Meanwhile, Chen Ping stepped forward, gripping the Dragon-Slaying Sword and slashing fiercely.
At the same time, Xuan Bin and the others engaged the Ten Hall’s cultivators, including the elder by Huo Qing’s side.
“Even without Elder Qian’s help, I can easily kill you!” the Ten Hall Master snarled, his expression turning vicious. He transformed into a streak of black light, charging straight at Chen Ping.
The Ten Hall Master moved with incredible speed, as though multiple versions of himself were rushing towards Chen Ping.
“Nine Shadows Sword Technique…”
Chen Ping, no longer holding back, unleashed the full power of the Nine Shadows Sword Technique.
This technique was incredibly taxing on his energy reserves.
Suddenly, multiple Chen Pings appeared, each identical and wielding a Dragon-Slaying Sword.
Most importantly, each Chen Ping exuded the same aura, making it impossible to distinguish the real one from the illusions.
“He actually has clones? This isn’t an illusion…”
The Ten Hall Master was stunned. He had assumed the multiple Chen Pings were the result of an illusion technique.
