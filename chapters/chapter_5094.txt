“Shura Guards, heed my command!”
With his low roar, a dull rumble suddenly emanated from beneath Liuli City, and dozens of dark figures shot up from the cracks in the ground.
Clad in black iron armour, their faces covered with ghostly masks, they wielded tattered weapons, their bodies shrouded in black mist. Each figure exuded a terrifying pressure comparable to that of the Grand Elder.
“This is… the ultimate guardians of the Shura Hall?” The face of the Tianyuan Pavilion Master showed shock and doubt for the first time, “The legendary dead warriors that only the Hall Master’s bloodline can awaken?”
The Grand Elder’s expression also changed drastically, exclaiming in horror, “You… are you mad? To awaken the Shura Guards for this Chen Ping?”
Looking at the Shura Guards before him, Chen Ping was also somewhat shocked!
He hadn’t expected such a force behind the Shura Hall!
The Shura Guards were the Shura Hall’s trump card, usually lying dormant and only awakened in times of life-and-death crisis for the Shura Hall!
Yet this time, Sang Tianyang had actually awakened the Shura Guards for Chen Ping!
No one had anticipated this, not even Sang Lan!
In her father’s eyes, this Chen Ping was apparently of such great importance!
Soon, the surrounding void began to ripple, and the powerful Shura Guards stood behind Sang Tianyang!
The aura of these Shura Guards was so formidable that their appearance made the entire world seem illusory!
It was simply too terrifying!
The Tianyuan Pavilion Master looked at these Shura Guards, his expression uglier than if he had eaten filth!
Each of these Shura Guards radiated the aura of a Seventh-Grade Loose Immortal, and each was filled with bloodthirsty killing intent!
So many Shura Guards together, what a terrifying existence!
It seemed the Shura Hall’s reputation was not unearned, and its strength had always been intact over the years!
Dozens of Shura Guards saluted Sang Tianyang in unison, for only the successive Hall Masters were qualified to summon the Shura Guards.

“Young friend Chen, with my protection, no one in the Second Heaven dares to harm you!”
Sang Tianyang said calmly to Chen Ping!
“Thank you, Hall Master Shura!” Chen Ping expressed his gratitude!
Sang Tianyang gave Chen Ping a faint smile, then his gaze turned cold as frost, pointing at the Grand Elder and the Tianyuan Pavilion members, “Shura Guards, kill without mercy!”
The black figures rushed out like phantoms, instantly clashing with the elders of Tianyuan Pavilion.
The explosive clash of weapons and the booming collision of energies shook Liuli City to its core.
“They are the Shura Hall’s final trump card,” Sang Tianyang’s breath was slightly unsteady, “Using my essence blood as a catalyst, they can only be sustained for the time of one incense stick, Young friend Chen, take your people and leave, I’ll handle this!”
“How could I escape at a time like this? That’s simply not my nature!”
Chen Ping, holding the Dragon-Slaying Sword, looked at Mo Qingyun and said, “Qingyun, stay back, I’ll deal with these dogs, then I’ll accompany you for a stroll!”
Chen Ping also had his own trump cards: two warrior statues, the Fire Qilin, the Divine King Bow, and the soul possession of the Red Cloud Demon Lord!
He had plenty of means, so if these people wanted to play, Chen Ping would play along!
The Grand Elder’s blade technique grew increasingly frenzied, “Sang Tianyang! So what if you’ve activated the Shura Guards? Today, I’ll make sure you and Chen Ping both perish!”
He exchanged a glance with the Tianyuan Pavilion Master, and the two lunged at Sang Tianyang simultaneously, clearly intending to end the battle before the Shura Guards were exhausted.
Above Liuli City, the purple-gold Shura phantom clashed fiercely with the moonlight-white wind blades, while decades-old grudges and vendettas erupted in full force at this moment!
The air of Liuli City was filled with the crackling sound of energy being torn apart.
Behind Sang Tianyang, the Shura Guards surged forth like a black tide, their dozens of Seventh-Grade Loose Immortal pressures weaving into a net, instantly Adeptly pushing back the Tianyuan Pavilion elders’ assault by half a step.
The Grand Elder, eyes bloodshot, his blade light wrapped in a blood-red Shura phantom aimed straight for Chen Ping’s heart, while the Tianyuan Pavilion Master raised his jade fan, sending several wind blades in a fan-shaped arc slicing towards Sang Tianyang’s throat.
