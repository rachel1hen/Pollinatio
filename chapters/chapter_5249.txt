“Convinced?” Mo Chen sheathed his wooden sword, asking with a beaming smile.
Chen Ping took a deep breath, clasped his hands, and said, “Senior, your swordsmanship is divine, I admit I’m no match.”
“Since you’re convinced, about joining the Sword Sect…”
“Senior, I…” Chen Ping wanted to say more, but Mo Chen suddenly stepped forward, swiftly patting his shoulder like a flash of lightning.
Chen Ping felt a gentle yet irresistible force surge into his body, a burning sensation instantly radiating from his shoulder, as if something had been branded there.
Looking down, he saw a faint golden sword-shaped mark on his shoulder, emitting a soft spiritual glow.
“This is the disciple mark of our Sword Sect. From now on, you’re one of us.”
Mo Chen patted his shoulder, his tone leaving no room for debate, “With your talent, you’re fit to be the senior disciple. Ling Xue is too impulsive, so you’ll need to take on more responsibilities for the sect.”
Ling Xue, standing nearby, was stunned, then her face lit up with joy. She bowed gracefully to Chen Ping, “Greetings, Senior Brother!”
Chen Ping opened his mouth, glancing at the indelible mark on his shoulder and Mo Chen’s expectant gaze, before finally letting out a helpless sigh.
He knew he’d been forcibly recruited.
Yet, despite Mo Chen’s assertiveness, there was no malice, only evident appreciation and intent to nurture him, which Chen Ping could sense.
“Fine, so be it.”
Chen Ping gave a wry smile, “Since Senior insists, I can only comply.”
Mo Chen laughed, “Hahaha, with you in our Sword Sect, we’ll surely flourish. Let Ling Xue take you to the News Tower, she knows the way.”
“Thank you, Senior.”
Chen Ping expressed his thanks and followed Ling Xue out of the courtyard.
Leaving Mo Chen’s courtyard, Ling Xue led Chen Ping and Hu Mazi toward the News Tower in the east of the city.
As they turned a corner, they ran into a few young disciples in Sword Sect attire. Leading them was a handsome youth with a gem-encrusted sword at his waist, clearly of high status.
Upon seeing Ling Xue, the youth’s eyes lit up. He hurried forward, his face warm with a smile, “Junior Sister Ling, what a coincidence! I was just looking for you. I got a piece of cold iron and wanted to ask you to the Sword Forging Workshop to see if we can craft a fine sword.”
His gaze swept over Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, his brow furrowing slightly, his tone tinged with scrutiny, “And these two are?”
Ling Xue stepped aside, gesturing to Chen Ping with a calm but firm tone, “This is Senior Brother Chen Ping, who, as of today, is our Sword Sect’s senior disciple. This is Senior Hu Mazi, a friend of Senior Brother Chen.”
“Senior disciple?” The Sword Sect disciples were dumbfounded, exchanging bewildered glances.
The eager youth burst out laughing, eyeing Chen Ping up and down with undisguised disdain, “Junior Sister Ling, are you joking? Him? A mere Loose Immortal Realm cultivator, fit to be our Sword Sect’s senior disciple? Our sect may not be what it once was, but we haven’t fallen so far as to let a Loose Immortal take that role, have we?”
He stepped forward, deliberately releasing the aura of a Third-Grade Earth Immortal, pressing it toward Chen Ping, “Kid, I don’t care what connections you pulled. To be senior disciple, you need the approval of us veterans. Dare to spar with me? If you can take three of my moves, I’ll acknowledge you as senior disciple!”
The other disciples chimed in, “Exactly! Senior Brother Li is the best of our generation, and even he isn’t qualified to be senior disciple. Why should an outsider take the role?”
Hu Mazi, watching impatiently, was about to speak, but Chen Ping raised a hand to stop him.
