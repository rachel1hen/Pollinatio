At the horizon, accompanied by a tremor in the void!
Chen Ping and Huo Zhao, who had previously vanished without a trace, not even a hint of their presence detectable, reappeared!
The two stood facing each other in midair, a wry smile creeping onto Huo Zhao’s face!
“You’ve won…”
Huo Zhao said!
“Alas, I could’ve easily crushed you, but this body just isn’t up to it!”
Chen Ping grinned!
Huo Zhao smiled too. By now, he already knew that the Chen Ping before him was no longer himself, having been possessed by a great power!
And not just any power, but a formidable master from the Heavenly Realm!
In front of such a being, he, a mere minor immortal, was no different from an ant!
“Elder Huo, you still haven’t killed this Chen Ping?”
Huo Zhenfeng, seeing that Chen Ping was still alive, shouted loudly!
Huo Zhao glanced at Huo Zhenfeng, shook his head slightly, and said, “You’d best fend for yourself…”
With that single sentence, Huo Zhao’s body began to fade rapidly, until it disappeared completely!
Witnessing this, Huo Zhenfeng was dumbfounded!
Even Ming Shao frowned slightly, his expression growing increasingly strange!
“Guardian, it’s this kid, kill him!”
Qian Xiaohan pointed at Chen Ping and said!
“A mere Great Ascension Realm cultivator, how could he make so many of you wary? Watch me smash him with one punch!”
The Guardian looked at Chen Ping, his eyes full of contempt!
“Kid, need me again? If I step in once more, this body of yours will really be done for!”
The Crimson Cloud Demon Lord said to Chen Ping!
“Senior, I’ll handle it myself!”
Chen Ping knew that if he let the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord fight again, his physical body would surely be destroyed!
Though he could reshape his body, who knew how long that would take? Chen Ping didn’t want to wait!
“Alright then, have your fun!”
The Crimson Cloud Demon Lord returned control of the body to Chen Ping!
Chen Ping was left speechless. This Crimson Cloud Demon Lord was calling a fight with an immortal “fun”!
He was just a Great Ascension Realm cultivator, who’d believe this if he told them!
A Great Ascension Realm cultivator daring to take on an immortal!
“Mr. Chen, let me test this big guy…”
At that moment, Nan Batian enlarged his body to a hundred metres tall and said to Chen Ping.
“You’re probably not his match…”
Chen Ping could tell at a glance that Nan Batian wouldn’t be able to beat this opponent!
Though Nan Batian had once been an immortal, he’d been trapped in the Ladder to Heaven for too long, and his strength was suppressed in the Celestial Realm, so he couldn’t possibly stand up to this foe!
“Mr. Chen, even if I’m not his match, I’ll wear him down a bit.”
“Otherwise, you won’t stand a chance against him!”
With that, Nan Batian threw a punch at the Guardian!
Two giants, each a hundred metres tall, clashed in battle!
Everyone had to crane their necks to watch!
Boom!
The fists of the two giants collided, and Nan Batian’s massive frame staggered backwards, his entire arm beginning to crumble!
With one punch, the victor was clear, Nan Batian was still a step behind!
And Nan Batian had already been through several fierce battles without fully recovering!
Looking at his shattered arm, Nan Batian said with slight embarrassment, “Mr. Chen, I can’t do it…”
“I’ll handle it myself!”
Chen Ping hovered in midair, coldly eyeing the Guardian!
“Kid, I really don’t want to kill you. A Great Ascension Realm cultivator? Killing you would just dirty my hands!”
“But alas, I promised to guard the Qian Gate for three thousand years, and I must keep my word!”
“I’ll make your death quick, don’t worry!”
With that, the Guardian threw a punch through the air at Chen Ping!
As the punch landed, countless vengeful spirits emerged between heaven and earth, their roars and piercing screams echoing across the entire Wuwang Land!
In that moment, Wuwang Land seemed to transform into a purgatory!
“Mr. Chen, be careful, that’s the Death Soul Fist…”
Seeing this, Nan Batian shouted a warning!
This Death Soul Fist, once its vengeful spirits enveloped you, meant certain death, even if the punch itself didn’t land!
