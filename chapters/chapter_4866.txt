Seeing this, Lin Chong and Wuji Daoist led their forces to join the assault on the Qian Gate and the Huo family!
With the addition of the five Domain Lords, the Qian Gate and Huo family stood no chance of resisting!
“Ming Shao, save us, save us…”
“Ming Shao, hurry and rescue us!”
Qian Xiaohan and Huo Zhenfeng kept pleading with Ming Shao for help!
But Ming Shao remained motionless, clearly with no intention of stepping in to save them!
At this point, Huo Zhenfeng was drowning in regret. He had originally hoped to cling to the Four Nether Palaces’ power, but now he’d gotten himself entangled in this mess and was about to be wiped out!
A one-sided slaughter began, with the cultivators of the Qian Gate and Huo family being cut down one by one!
“Now it’s time for the two of us to have some fun…”
Chen Ping looked at Ming Shao with a mocking grin!
Ming Shao’s face was ashen. His arrogance and bravado stemmed from the backing he had!
Mo Shan’s speed, the Four Old Ghosts—they were his trump cards!
But now, Ming Shao had no one left by his side!
“One-on-one, you’re no match for me!”
Ming Shao said to Chen Ping!
His meaning was clear: he didn’t want Chen Ping calling for help!
But he seemed to forget that he’d been the one constantly summoning reinforcements!
“You’re nothing…”
With that, Chen Ping slashed a sword toward Ming Shao in an instant!
He’d had enough of this pretentious fool. A terrifying sword light shot straight at Ming Shao!
Ming Shao’s expression changed drastically!
Boom!
As the sword light erupted, Ming Shao was blasted back, and the bone ship beneath his feet crumbled to ashes in an instant!
Before he could even steady himself, another sword light came hurtling toward him!
This one was faster and even more powerful!
It appeared out of nowhere, giving Ming Shao no chance to react!
Panic surged in Ming Shao’s heart. He clenched his fists, and a shroud of malevolent energy enveloped him as he tried to withstand the blow!
Boom!
Ming Shao was sent flying again!
Boom!
And again!
In front of Chen Ping, Ming Shao had no power to fight back!
“That’s it? And you dared to act so high and mighty?”
Chen Ping sneered with disdain!
He hadn’t expected Ming Shao to be this weak. The guy seemed impressive, but it was all just a façade!
After being knocked back repeatedly, the shield of malevolent energy around Ming Shao was already cracking!
At this moment, he was utterly dumbfounded!
He’d called everyone he could and used every trick up his sleeve!
But who could’ve imagined Chen Ping had so many powerful allies, wave after wave, seemingly endless!
In the end, even the five Domain Lords came to Chen Ping’s aid!
Without these people, Chen Ping would’ve been a corpse by now!
Now, with all his options exhausted, Ming Shao was out of moves!
What he didn’t know was that the truly formidable figure behind Chen Ping was Mr. Shi!
Mr. Shi hadn’t even shown up yet—otherwise, the Four Nether Palaces would’ve ceased to exist long ago!
“Pretentious trash, watch this, here comes another sword!”
Chen Ping swung yet another strike at Ming Shao!
And he even announced it, clearly toying with him!
Ming Shao frowned, hurriedly raising his hands to block!
But then he realised that when the sword light reached him, it suddenly vanished without striking!
Ming Shao froze, then roared in fury, “If you want to fight, fight! Who are you trying to scare?”
He thought Chen Ping was just bluffing!
But Chen Ping only smiled faintly, saying nothing!
That smile sent a chill down Ming Shao’s spine, an eerie and terrifying feeling!
Suddenly, Ming Shao sensed a dangerous aura. Turning his head, he discovered that, unbeknownst to him, a sword light had appeared behind him!
His face paled as he gasped in shock, “How is this possible?”
The sword light had clearly vanished right in front of him—how could it suddenly appear at his back?
What Ming Shao didn’t know was that Chen Ping’s Dragon-Slaying Sword was a spiritual weapon. Even if Chen Ping did nothing, the sword spirit Zhong Li could control it to attack on its own!
