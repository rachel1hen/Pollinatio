“Breaking through a realm so easily, it seems this Purgatory Arena is quite a place!”
Chen Ping felt the surge in strength from his breakthrough, his heart filled with joy.
Buzz!
As Chen Ping was still basking in the elation of his advancement, the surrounding area suddenly trembled, then became blurry.
“A temporal cage?”
Chen Ping was startled!
To cast such a temporal spell required an absolute powerhouse targeting a lower-realm cultivator, twisting the entire space-time and creating a new pocket of time to trap someone within!
The moment the temporal cage formed, Chen Ping vanished from Niu Meng’s bronze mirror, for he had been ensnared in another dimension by the Mad Immortal.
Chen Ping frowned, not expecting to encounter other challengers in the Purgatory Arena, as such a temporal cage was beyond the capabilities of demon corpses or evil souls.
Gripping his Dragon-Slaying Sword, Chen Ping swung fiercely!
Rumble…
A golden sword aura shot skyward, shattering the newly formed temporal cage with a single strike.
The instant the cage broke, Chen Ping spotted the Mad Immortal who had attacked him.
The Mad Immortal’s eyes flashed with surprise, astonished that his temporal cage had been shattered by a mere Immortal Transformation Realm cultivator with one sword strike.
Suddenly, Chen Ping, wielding his Dragon-Slaying Sword, slashed towards the Mad Immortal.
The Mad Immortal froze, even more stunned, wondering who gave Chen Ping the audacity, a mere Immortal Transformation Realm cultivator, to attack him, a Loose Immortal Realm master.
Wasn’t this courting death?
The Mad Immortal’s temper flared, and he stepped forward, charging at Chen Ping, intent on teaching this Immortal Transformation Realm brat a lesson.
The gap between Immortal Transformation and Loose Immortal was an insurmountable chasm.
Immortal Transformation was merely a pseudo-immortal state, while Loose Immortal was true ascension, just short of being listed in the Immortal Registry.
The Mad Immortal threw a punch at Chen Ping, fearless against the Dragon-Slaying Sword!
Boom!
The sword aura and fist collided heavily.
Chen Ping’s body was sent flying back, but he landed steadily on the ground.
The Mad Immortal, however, was forced back several steps, barely stabilizing himself, his entire arm trembling.
This scene left the Mad Immortal’s face grim.
He hadn’t expected a mere Immortal Transformation Realm cultivator like Chen Ping to possess such terrifying strength!
Even City Lord Niu Meng, witnessing this, couldn’t help but swallow hard, his face full of disbelief.
The Mad Immortal glared coldly at Chen Ping, about to say something, when Chen Ping, without a word, swung his Dragon-Slaying Sword again.
“Damn it…” the Mad Immortal cursed, throwing another punch.
Boom!
This punch shattered Chen Ping’s sword aura once more, but just as the Mad Immortal was about to mock him, thousands of sword auras rained down from above like a storm.
The Mad Immortal’s expression changed, and he hurriedly raised both palms, conjuring a barrier above his head.
The sword auras struck the barrier, shattering upon impact, unable to breach it.
But before the Mad Immortal could catch his breath, Chen Ping charged again with his sword.
“Damn it, are you insane?”
The Mad Immortal frowned, exasperated, cursing Chen Ping as a lunatic.
Yet, ironically, he was the one called the Mad Immortal, and now Chen Ping seemed even crazier.
As Chen Ping’s Dragon-Slaying Sword reached the Mad Immortal, the latter’s brows furrowed, sensing the violent, murderous aura emanating from Chen Ping, leaving him bewildered.
He hadn’t noticed it during the initial clash, but now he realized that beyond Chen Ping’s terrifying murderous aura, there was a sinister malevolent energy and a pervasive demonic aura.
