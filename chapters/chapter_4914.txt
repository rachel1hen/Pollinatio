At this moment, two girls, clad only in underwear, were being gawked at by a crowd inside an iron cage!
The two girls trembled with fear, their eyes brimming with terror!
Upon seeing these two girls, the scene erupted into a commotion!
“Blimey, they’re stunning…”
“Big guy, where did you find such gorgeous human girls?”
“If I could take them home, they’d make fine slaves!”
The crowd stared unabashedly at the girls, hurling filthy remarks without restraint!
Hu Mazi, at this moment, had a glint in his eyes, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he bit his lip hard, probably itching to rush the stage and snatch them!
“Well, what did I tell you? Top-notch goods, five hundred immortal coins, not a penny too much!”
“Whoever wants them, start bidding, five hundred immortal coins is the starting price, highest bidder wins!”
The big guy shouted!
“Five hundred and five…”
“Five hundred and six…”
“Five hundred and seven…”
Soon, people began clamouring to bid, though the increments were small!
It seemed everyone here was skint, adding ten coins at a time!
The two girls huddled together, reduced to mere commodities, stripped of any rights, unable to resist!
Just like vendors in the mortal world selling animals!
But in the Heavenly Realm, humans, beasts, and demons stood on the same starting line, so humans could also be treated as goods!
“I bid one thousand…”
At that moment, Hu Mazi, standing beside Chen Ping, suddenly shouted!
His voice was like a thunderclap, silencing the scene instantly!
Others were adding ten coins at a time, reluctantly at that!
Yet someone had boldly bid one thousand immortal coins!
All eyes turned to Hu Mazi, and the big guy on stage was visibly excited, staring intently at him!
Under the crowd’s gaze, Hu Mazi showed no trace of fear!
After all, he was a Human Immortal of the Sixth Heaven, what scene hadn’t he witnessed? A thousand immortal coins were pocket change to him!
But Hu Mazi overlooked one thing: they had just been ushered in by the Great Dao, who among them had immortal coins?
Chen Ping had plenty of spirit coins, immortal spirit stones, and even divine weapons and spirit tools scavenged from others!
But those were useful in the Celestial Human Realm, not here in the Heavenly Realm, where they weren’t recognised!
Immortal spirit stones were the best resource in the Celestial Human Realm, but in the Heavenly Realm, they were practically worthless!
“Master Hu, do you have immortal coins?” Chen Ping whispered.
“I…” Hu Mazi only then realised he had no immortal coins!
He was no longer a Human Immortal of the Sixth Heaven, not even a Loose Immortal now!
“This fellow, you’ve just been ushered in by the Great Dao, yet you’re so lavish!”
“One thousand immortal coins, these two human girls are yours!”
The big guy enthusiastically addressed Hu Mazi!
Hu Mazi gave an awkward smile and asked, “Mate, can you put it on my tab?”
The big guy froze, then snapped angrily, “Mate, are you having me on? Have you got no immortal coins?”
“How could I not? I’m just a bit short on cash at the moment!”
Hu Mazi refused to admit he was broke!
“Bloody hell, you’re taking the piss!”
The big guy, furious, lunged at Hu Mazi!
As he made his move, Chen Ping and the others’ faces fell in shock!
Clearly, this big guy had reached the Loose Immortal realm!
The others, seeing him act, scattered to the sides!
“Bloody hell, a mere minor cultivator dares to come at me!”
Hu Mazi, enraged, snorted coldly and struck back with a palm!
Bang!
With that strike, Hu Mazi’s body crashed to the ground, blood spurting from his mouth!
“Master Hu…” Chen Ping rushed forward to help him up, “Why are you acting tough? You’re not a Human Immortal anymore.”
“Damn it, I forgot…”
Hu Mazi looked utterly helpless!
