Boom…
Another blood-red thunder tribulation struck down, the pen in the middle-aged man’s hand suddenly burst with golden light, then he swung it fiercely!
A golden aura formed in mid-air, but upon touching the blood-red thunder tribulation, it shattered instantly, the thunder tribulation crashing down!
The cultivators behind the middle-aged man showed terror and despair in their eyes!
They knew that failure meant doom for all!
Facing the rolling thunder tribulation, the middle-aged man took a deep breath, his body instantly turning into a streak of light!
This man was actually going to withstand the blood-red thunder tribulation with his body!
For his family, for his clan, he could only succeed, not fail.
Boom!
The streak of light tore the thunder tribulation apart, and hope reignited in everyone’s eyes.
But just as hope sparked, countless blood-red thunder tribulations descended again!
The middle-aged man roared desperately, the pen in his hand swinging out golden lights one after another, shielding the clan below!
He knew that his own failure was not the worst; the worst was his entire clan suffering with him!
The blood-red thunder tribulations grew more numerous, and the middle-aged man’s aura began to weaken!
The clansmen below desperately channelled their energy into the man!
Some clansmen spat blood and collapsed, dying from exhaustion!
After another dozen blood-red thunder tribulations, the middle-aged man’s aura continued to decline!
“Fate, perhaps this is the fate of our Wuyou Clan!”
“Clan leader, enough… enough…”
Some had exhausted their lifelong cultivation, and after speaking, collapsed and died!
The middle-aged man looked at his dying clansmen, sighed softly, his eyes filled with dim sorrow.
They had failed, and their entire clan would vanish!
To gamble for the Earth Immortal Realm, they had staked the lives of the whole clan!
Was it worth it?
The middle-aged man was now lost in confusion!
But then, his gaze fell on Chen Ping, noticing that Chen Ping faced the blood-red thunder tribulation with calm indifference, fearless!
“Young master, could you help me break through this blood-red thunder tribulation?”
The middle-aged man asked Chen Ping!
Chen Ping shook his head; he didn’t even know if he could withstand the blood-red thunder tribulation, so how could he help the man?
The middle-aged man frowned slightly. Though Chen Ping was only at the fifth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, he felt Chen Ping’s strength was extraordinary!
Otherwise, even a peak Loose Immortal would pale instantly before the blood-red thunder tribulation!
“All clansmen, heed my command, take out your storage bags!”
The middle-aged man shouted loudly!
Tens of thousands of clansmen, unsure why, obediently complied, taking out their storage bags!
With a wave of his hand, the tens of thousands of storage bags flew straight to Chen Ping!
“These resources are yours, help me break through the blood-red thunder tribulation!”
The middle-aged man said urgently!
Without help, he couldn’t break through, and the entire Wuyou Clan would be finished, gone forever!
Chen Ping glanced at the storage bags, said nothing, and shook his head again!
Risking his life for these things wasn’t worth it!
The middle-aged man’s brows furrowed, then he spoke again, “Young master, I can forgo breaking through this blood-red thunder tribulation, but please save a few of my clansmen, so our Wuyou Clan doesn’t perish entirely.”
With that, he waved his hand, and dozens of young men and women flew up, landing before Chen Ping!
Chen Ping looked at the terrified young men and women, then asked curiously, “How do you know I can block this blood-red thunder tribulation and save your clansmen?”
“Instinct!” the middle-aged man said. “But if you can’t block the blood-red thunder tribulation and my clan perishes, I won’t blame you. These storage bags are still yours!”
