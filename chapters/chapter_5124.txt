The old man in black shook his head, “I don’t know!”
“Because I want to eliminate all threats, tell me, where is your family?”
Chen Ping said.
Huo Zhao was instantly speechless upon hearing this.
Huo Feng, however, laughed heartily, “Brother-in-law is awesome, that’s the way to do it!”
The old man in black was utterly stunned.
Killing is one thing, but why ask about family?
Without deep hatred, was it necessary to eradicate everyone?
“I… I have no family!” the old man in black said.
But as soon as he spoke, his body exploded instantly, and his soul was completely annihilated!
At that moment, Mo Qingyun’s expression suddenly changed, “Oh no, my father and the others are in danger!”
The jade pendant on Mo Qingyun’s body was flashing red light continuously.
“Let’s go!”
Chen Ping said, pulling Mo Qingyun along as they vanished into the horizon!
Chen Ping was already an invincible existence in the Second Heaven, so he had no reservations whatsoever!
With his current strength, he could absolutely show off!
When Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun arrived at the Mo family, the Mo family was surrounded by a dense mass of cultivators!
Mo Wuji’s face was extremely grim, leading the Mo family disciples to send Mo Qingyun their final farewell!
“All Mo family disciples, listen up, this is our last battle, remember, it’s better to die with honour than to surrender!”
Mo Wuji made his final rally!
All the Mo family disciples nodded, and just as they were about to fight to the death, a terrifying aura suddenly surged from the horizon!
Boom…
With a loud explosion, all the attacking cultivators surrounding the Mo family had their bodies explode, their souls entirely extinguished!
Mo Wuji and the Mo family members stared blankly at the scene before them, completely unaware of what had happened!
Even more clueless about where that terrifying aura had come from!
“Patriarch, could this be divine protection, our Mo family ancestors showing their spirit?”
A Mo family disciple said in shock!
“What Mo family ancestors, it’s Chen Ping…”
At that moment, Mo Qingyun’s voice rang out, followed by the appearance of Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun!
“Qingyun!” Seeing Mo Qingyun, Mo Wuji was overjoyed!
“Father, are you all okay?” Mo Qingyun rushed forward, asking with concern!
“I’m fine, did you just say it was Mr. Chen, that terrifying aura was unleashed by Mr. Chen?”
Mo Wuji could hardly believe it!
“Of course, it was Chen Ping who saved you!” Mo Qingyun nodded!
Mo Wuji looked at Chen Ping, whose cultivation had advanced rapidly, already at the fifth rank of the Loose Immortal realm, but that terrifying aura just now, even a peak Loose Immortal emperor might not achieve, could they?
In his shock, Mo Wuji was also thrilled, with Chen Ping around, their Mo family could roam freely in the realm!
In the days that followed, Chen Ping, with a single sword, swept through the various forces in the Second Heaven, and under Chen Ping’s might, the Second Heaven finally restored its calm.
With Chen Ping as their backing, the Mo family and the Eight Halls directly became the two largest forces in the Second Heaven!
The two families divided the Second Heaven, and their relationship grew closer!
After all, Mo Qingyun and Huo Jingjing were both Chen Ping’s women, so the two families naturally became close!
After handling the affairs of the Second Heaven, Chen Ping decided to head to the Third Heaven.
Upon hearing this news, Mo Qingyun and Huo Jingjing looked troubled.
They knew that with their current strength, they simply couldn’t go to the Third Heaven.
The immortal energy in the Third Heaven was denser, and the power of its laws was even more ferocious, without sufficient strength, entering the Third Heaven was like a lamb walking into a tiger’s den.
“No need to worry.”
Chen Ping looked at their worried expressions and smiled faintly.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand glowed brightly, with golden light constantly flickering on the blade.
Chen Ping took a deep breath, channelled all the power in his body, and slashed towards the void.
