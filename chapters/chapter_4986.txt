As the group stepped inside, the old man said to Chen Ping and the others, “Alright, leave the prisoner here, you can go now.”
Chen Ping, seeing this, suddenly attacked the old man.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword in Chen Ping’s hand let out a humming sound, then fiercely slashed towards the old man!
The old man’s pupils contracted, he spun around abruptly, throwing a punch with his fist!
Boom!
A powerful surge of fist energy forcibly halted Chen Ping’s sword strike, but the old man’s body was instantly knocked back dozens of metres!
“Who are you people, exactly?”
The old man stared at Chen Ping and his group with a face full of doubt!
Chen Ping glanced at Aisha, her mouth bleeding, then removed his armour and sneered at the old man, “Old fool, don’t you know how to show pity to a lady? You’re quite ruthless with women, aren’t you? Let me tell you, I despise men who hit women the most.”
“Hmph, since you’ve delivered yourselves to me, don’t blame me for being merciless.”
The old man snorted coldly, then thrust both hands forward.
Boom!
The surrounding space trembled violently, countless terrifying auras pressing down on Chen Ping and his group!
Mad Immortal and Bai Yi exchanged a glance, then both suddenly struck!
Rumble!
The terrifying aura shattered instantly, and the old man’s body was knocked back once more.
Seeing this, the old man’s expression shifted, already contemplating retreat.
Chen Ping, noticing this, vanished in an instant, reappearing above the old man’s head the next moment!
He couldn’t let the old man escape.
Chen Ping swung his sword down towards the old man’s head.
The old man’s face paled, instinctively retreating to dodge the blow.
But no matter how he retreated, he was enveloped by the sword’s radiance!
Swish, swish, swish…
Beams of sword light fell like a torrential downpour.
“Argh…”
The old man let out a furious roar, a powerful aura erupting, instantly shattering the sword beams.
At that moment, Chen Ping, who had been above the old man’s head, vanished again.
The old man instinctively looked around, and when he spotted Chen Ping, the Dragon-Slaying Sword was already pressed against his neck.
“I’m an elder of Flying Tiger City, if you kill me, none of you will escape.”
The old man threatened Chen Ping.
“I never planned to escape, take us inside!”
Chen Ping commanded, controlling the old man!
Though Chen Ping and his group had passed through the heavenly prison’s main gate, they still needed the old man to lead them deeper inside.
Under Chen Ping’s control, the old man had no choice but to guide them towards the depths of the heavenly prison.
After passing through three more gates, a thick stench of blood hit them!
Chen Ping and the others furrowed their brows, while Aisha’s face was filled with worry!
Such a strong smell of blood meant many had died.
When Chen Ping and his group passed through another gate, they were stunned by the sight before them.
The ground was littered with corpses strewn haphazardly, blood flowing like a river!
Among the bodies were the elderly, the weak, women, and children.
The stench of blood was so overpowering it made it hard to breathe!
Seeing this, Aisha’s eyes blazed with fury, and she roared at the old man, “Why, why did you kill them…”
“Blame yourself, who told you to escape? One person escapes, ten thousand are killed as punishment.”
The old man said shamelessly!
Aisha’s body trembled, her anger making her unsteady on her feet.
“Evil will meet its reckoning, your slaughter will eventually fall upon your own heads.”
Chen Ping looked at the old man coldly, and with a casual flick of his Dragon-Slaying Sword!
The old man’s head was severed, flying far into the distance!
At that moment, screams still echoed from the depths of the heavenly prison, indicating the slaughter was ongoing.
“Please, I beg you, save my people…”
Aisha knelt before Chen Ping and the others!
Chen Ping said nothing, but the murderous intent in his eyes made it clear he could no longer restrain himself.
“Who are you people?”
At that moment, a soldier in armour spotted Chen Ping and his group, charging towards them rapidly!
