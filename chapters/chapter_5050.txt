“Why did it only attack me and not the two of them?” the man in green asked, clearly displeased.
“Maybe it just didn’t like the look of you!” the woman in white said with a cold smirk.
“You…”
The man in green was furious but didn’t dare do anything to the woman in white.
She was from the Asura Hall, and her strength might even surpass his. Now injured, he’d struggle to fight, let alone escape if things went south.
“Maybe it’s because of the presence of a woman. Why don’t you give it a try?” Tianci said to the woman in white.
Chen Ping had been with Mo Qingyun, a woman, and the statues hadn’t attacked them.
Now, the woman in white was the only other woman present, so Tianci suggested she test it.
“If that’s the case, why don’t you try? Don’t you count as half a woman?” the woman in white sneered.
“You…”
Tianci’s face flushed red with anger.
He hated it when people called him feminine. Though he dressed like a woman daily, he didn’t allow others to say it.
Perhaps such sect prodigies had a perverse mentality.
“Isn’t it simple to test if it’s because of a woman? Just have those two come back, and let that first-grade Loose Immortal kid go alone. Then we’ll know,” the woman in white said with a faint smile.
Tianci immediately called out to Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun, “Little sister Qingyun, both of you come back…”
Mo Qingyun didn’t respond or move.
Chen Ping looked at Tianci and said, “What are you up to?”
“I’m just worried about you two getting hurt, no ill intentions. But if you don’t come back, I’ll get angry.”
“And you should know the consequences of my anger…” Tianci threatened Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun.
Mo Qingyun was a bit scared and gently tugged at Chen Ping’s sleeve.
The image of Tianci killing someone earlier still lingered in her mind.
“Don’t be afraid, we’ll go back,” Chen Ping reassured Mo Qingyun, and the two walked back.
Seeing them return, Tianci’s eyes burned with killing intent. He wanted to slap Chen Ping to death right then.
But Chen Ping was still useful, to be used as a guinea pig.
“Go back there,” Tianci ordered Chen Ping.
“Damn, you’re really pushing it…” Chen Ping was getting annoyed.
“Die or go back, your choice!” Tianci threatened.
Chen Ping gave him a cold look. In his heart, Tianci was already a dead man.
He’d find a chance to kill him eventually.
But now wasn’t the time, and Chen Ping couldn’t afford to confront him.
Taking a deep breath, Chen Ping prepared to walk back.
“I’ll go with you…” Mo Qingyun started to follow him again.
But Tianci grabbed her, saying, “Let him go alone…”
“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine,” Chen Ping gave Mo Qingyun a slight smile before heading back to the stone platform.
This time, Chen Ping kept his eyes fixed on the two statues.
If they made a move, he’d have to dodge quickly.
Even a fifth-grade Loose Immortal couldn’t withstand a single blow, so Chen Ping didn’t dare take the risk.
Trembling with caution, Chen Ping stepped onto the platform. The statues’ eyes followed him, but they didn’t attack.
“Huh?” Tianci frowned.
The others were equally baffled, unable to understand what was going on.
“Looks like it has nothing to do with being a woman,” the woman in white said.
“Then why? Why did it only attack me?” the man in green was on the verge of breaking down.
“Maybe because I’m better-looking than you, so I’m fine!” Chen Ping said with a laugh, standing on the platform.
At this moment, Chen Ping’s tension eased considerably.
“Bullsh*t, I’m way better-looking than you!” the man in green roared in anger.
