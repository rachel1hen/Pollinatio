A massive rift appeared in the void, emitting a powerful suction force, distorting and warping the surrounding space.
Chen Ping let out a loud shout, swinging his sword again, and the rift expanded further, forming a passageway to the Third Heaven.
Within the passage, light flickered, faintly revealing the dazzling scenery of the Third Heaven.
“This… how is this possible?”
Mo Qingyun and Huo Jingjing’s eyes widened, their faces filled with disbelief.
They had never seen anyone so effortlessly tear through the void to create a passage.
“Let’s go,” Chen Ping said with a smile, turning to Hu Mazi, “Master Hu, fancy a trip to the Third Heaven?”
Hu Mazi grinned, “Wherever you go, I’ll follow, with you around, there’s no shortage of women!”
The four stepped into the passage, which slowly closed behind them.
The moment they emerged, a dense, almost tangible wave of immortal energy hit them.
The sky of the Third Heaven glowed an eerie purple, with massive floating islands, each radiating a powerful aura.
“The aura of this Third Heaven is truly unique!”
Chen Ping gazed at this unfamiliar yet challenging world, his eyes brimming with fighting spirit.
The Tianyan Sect, the Barbaric Ancient Clan, the Blood Shadow Palace, and the Seven Halls, Chen Ping would visit them all.
With his current strength, he could be invincible in the Third Heaven!
Not long after Chen Ping and his group set foot in the Third Heaven, various forces caught wind of their arrival.
Some ancient families began closely monitoring them, a person capable of opening a void passage was no ordinary cultivator.
These families sent spies to uncover Chen Ping’s background.
In a mysterious location in the Third Heaven, a black-robed elder slowly opened his eyes, a cold glint flashing within, “A young lad from the Second Heaven, able to open a void passage, interesting, truly interesting…”
Chen Ping, Mo Qingyun, Huo Jingjing, and Hu Mazi randomly chose an island to settle on.
Once they familiarised themselves, Chen Ping planned to challenge those forces.
Unbeknownst to them, the island they landed on was called Qingyun Island, rich in immortal energy but relatively remote, suitable for a temporary base.
However, trouble soon found them.
Qingyun Island was the territory of a small force, the Qingyun Sect, not particularly powerful in the Third Heaven but not to be underestimated.
The sect’s disciples, upon discovering outsiders occupying their island, immediately reported to their superiors.
The Qingyun Sect’s leader, Yun Wuya, personally led a group of strong cultivators to confront them.
“Who are these brats daring to occupy my Qingyun Island!” Yun Wuya stood in the sky, looking down at Chen Ping and his group with arrogant eyes.
Chen Ping looked up at Yun Wuya calmly, “We’re only staying here temporarily, with no intent to offend, once we find a suitable place, we’ll leave.”
Chen Ping was exceedingly polite, not because he wanted conflict with these Qingyun Sect members!
It wasn’t that Chen Ping was kind-hearted, but in his eyes, the Qingyun Sect members were mere ants!
Who would be interested in fighting an ant?
Yun Wuya sized up Chen Ping and his group, noting their highest cultivation was only the fifth rank of the Loose Immortal realm!
How did such cultivators reach the Third Heaven?
“You’re from the Second Heaven, aren’t you? Sucked here by a void turbulence?” Yun Wuya asked curiously!
Chen Ping didn’t want to explain much, so he nodded!
Seeing they were from the Second Heaven, accidentally brought by void turbulence, Yun Wuya’s expression grew even more arrogant!
“Hmph! My Qingyun Sect isn’t a temporary residence, leave now or die, your choice!” Yun Wuya sneered.
