“Ant.”
The moment the armoured figure spoke, Chen Ping’s eardrums throbbed with pain, and the surrounding space began to fracture inch by inch.
The voice seemed to rise from the depths of the underworld, carrying the wails of countless aggrieved souls.
Chen Ping’s pupils contracted sharply, the oppressive might of the Loose Immortal realm bearing down like a mountain, nearly suffocating him.
Yet, he gritted his teeth, the malevolent energy he had just absorbed surging wildly within him, reigniting crimson flames on the Dragon-Slaying Sword.
“Perfect timing!”
With a fierce shout, he shot forward like an arrow, his sword striking at an angle, aiming for the gap at the figure’s throat.
The giant axe swept across with overwhelming force. Chen Ping narrowly dodged, the axe’s wind grazing his shoulder, tearing off a chunk of his clothing.
He twisted in mid-air, thrusting his sword at the weak joint of the armour, only to be repelled by the black iron, sparks flying.
The armoured figure countered with another axe swing. Chen Ping blocked with his sword, the immense impact numbing his grip, forcing him back dozens of steps.
In the city lord’s mansion, a servant had already delivered Chen Ping’s profile.
Upon seeing that Chen Ping was merely an eighth-grade Immortal Transformation realm cultivator, Gadfly shot up from his chair, disbelief in his eyes.
A cultivator who had only recently undergone the Great Dao’s guidance at the Immortal Transformation realm—how could he be this formidable?
Gadfly glanced at the scene reflected in the bronze mirror, his face paling.
“A Loose Immortal realm demonic corpse has appeared, and this lad can still fight it?”
He stared intently at Chen Ping battling the armoured figure, veins bulging on his forehead.
In all of Rhino City, not a single Immortal Transformation realm cultivator could face a Loose Immortal realm opponent. The gap between the two realms wasn’t just a matter of level—it was a chasm, a divide between heaven and earth!
Gadfly watched, stunned, as the battle in the purgatory arena grew fiercer.
Chen Ping’s flames were repeatedly scattered by the axe, and his body bore several deep, bone-revealing wounds.
Yet, each injury allowed him to absorb the lingering malevolent energy from the figure’s attacks through the Dragon-Slaying Sword, refining his own aura further.
He keenly noticed that, despite the figure’s superior realm, its combat style was rigid, relying solely on brute force.
“Got it!”
A glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes.
When the axe forced him into a corner once more, he suddenly discarded his sword, forming hand seals. His flames transformed into chains, binding the giant axe.
In the moment the armoured figure faltered, Chen Ping lunged forward, pressing his palm, blazing with supreme yang fire, against its helmet.
“Screech—”
The black iron helmet emitted a teeth-grinding melting sound, the ghostly green flames within twisting wildly under the intense heat.
The armoured figure roared, struggling to break free, but Chen Ping clung on like a parasite, pouring all his strength into the flames.
“Break!”
With a thunderous shout, the helmet shattered, revealing a burning skull.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword, somehow back in Chen Ping’s hand, cleaved down with unstoppable force.
The skull split in two, and the armoured figure’s body collapsed, crumbling into a pile of bones.
Chen Ping dropped to one knee, gasping heavily, his wounds healing at a visible rate, while his aura showed faint signs of a breakthrough.
Gadfly, witnessing it all, slumped back in his chair, cold sweat soaking his back.
He gazed at Chen Ping standing bloodied in the mirror, his heart roiling with shock.
This young man had not only slain thousands of demonic corpses but also defeated a Loose Immortal realm demonic corpse in an unimaginable way. Such talent and methods rivalled even the legendary ancient prodigies!
If Chen Ping was truly from the demon race, Rhino City was in grave danger!
“We must send someone to monitor him immediately!”
Gadfly slammed his hand on the table, his eyes flickering with complex emotions.
He both wanted to recruit Chen Ping and feared he might be a demon.
Unbeknownst to Chen Ping, his battle had been witnessed in its entirety by City Lord Gadfly.
