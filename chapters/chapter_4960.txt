Seeing the situation, Li Tianbao’s heart leapt with joy. Suppressing his pain, he struggled to the side of the spy holding Niu Ben hostage.
“Niu Mang, didn’t expect this, did you? The heavens always leave a way out,” Li Tianbao sneered darkly, “Step aside and let us leave, or your son’s life is forfeit.”
Niu Mang’s face flickered with uncertainty, his heart torn as he looked into his son’s terrified eyes.
As the lord of a city, he couldn’t allow Flying Tiger City’s spies to walk away so brazenly, but this was his own flesh and blood. How could he stand by and watch his son in mortal danger?
“Don’t act rashly,” Chen Ping stepped forward, whispering, “Let them go for now, and we’ll plan our next move.”
Niu Mang gritted his teeth, then slowly dispelled the formation.
“Leave, but mark my words, Flying Tiger City’s actions today will not be forgotten by Rhino City. We’ll settle this score eventually!”
Li Tianbao smirked triumphantly, gesturing for his spies to retreat slowly.
“Niu Mang, until we meet again. I hope you’ll still have this much spine next time.”
Watching the Flying Tiger City spies’ figures fade into the distance, Niu Mang clenched his fists, his nails digging into his palms, blood dripping through his fingers.
“Father!” Niu Li ran out from her room, tears welling in her eyes as she saw her brother being held hostage, “You have to save him!”
“Don’t worry, I’ll bring Ben back,” Niu Mang said, his gaze resolute, “Flying Tiger City dares to act so arrogantly on Rhino City’s turf. I’ll make them pay a heavy price!”
With that, Niu Mang turned to the mansion’s guards, barking, “Who was on gate duty today? How did these people get in?”
The City Lord’s Mansion required a token for entry, yet so many Flying Tiger City spies had infiltrated without any guard stopping them, leaving Niu Mang deeply suspicious.
He began to wonder if there was a traitor in the mansion, especially since even the shopkeeper of Tianbao Pavilion had turned out to be a Flying Tiger City spy. He was starting to trust no one.
“City Lord, we were on duty today. These Flying Tiger City spies entered with a token, and we verified it as genuine, so we let them in,” a guard stepped forward, speaking cautiously.
“How could they have a token?” Niu Mang asked, perplexed.
At that moment, Chen Ping seemed to realise something, saying sheepishly, “The token, it was probably from me…”
Chen Ping recalled how he had pawned the token at Tianbao Pavilion.
“You?” Niu Mang was stunned, “Big brother, how did you get a City Lord’s Mansion token?”
Before Chen Ping could respond, Niu Li, who had just noticed him, said in surprise, “It’s you? Did you pawn my token?”
Hearing Chen Ping’s words, Niu Li also remembered.
Chen Ping nodded awkwardly, “I was short on immortal coins at the time and had no choice but to pawn the token at Tianbao Pavilion…”
Niu Mang looked at Niu Li and Chen Ping, confused about how his daughter knew Chen Ping.
“No wonder I couldn’t track the token’s location when I tried to find you later,” Niu Li said, a touch of reproach in her voice.
“Really sorry about that!” Chen Ping apologised again, then explained to Niu Mang how he had come by the token.
After hearing the explanation, Niu Mang didn’t press further. After all, he didn’t dare reprimand Chen Ping, who was now his “big brother.”
“Big brother, you couldn’t have foreseen this. It’s not your fault. It’s my failure to judge character. I never imagined Li Tianbao was a Flying Tiger City spy,” Niu Mang said, his face filled with rage at the thought of the Tianbao Pavilion shopkeeper, wishing he could tear Li Tianbao apart.
