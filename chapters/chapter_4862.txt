Huo Zhao watched Chen Ping, who suddenly seemed like a different person, and his brows couldn’t help but furrow!
“What the hell are you staring at, you little trash? Come over here…” Chen Ping taunted, beckoning Huo Zhao with a wave!
Huo Zhao froze, sizing up Chen Ping, “You dare talk to me like that? You’re bloody asking for it…”
With that, Huo Zhao stepped forward, throwing a punch!
Seeing this, Chen Ping swung a fist of his own, not even bothering with the Divine King Bow!
Boom!
Two wildly different fist auras erupted, clashing fiercely together!
As the fist energies collided, the heavens and earth turned chaotic, if not for the Heaven-Ascending Ladder holding it together, Wuwang Land would’ve collapsed long ago!
“Who the hell are you?”
Huo Zhao gaped at Chen Ping, dumbfounded, that last punch had gone head-to-head with Chen Ping, and Chen Ping had taken it without a scratch!
This was beyond absurd!
“I’m your ancestor…”
Chen Ping retorted, then threw a punch, taking the initiative to attack!
“You’ve gone too far…”
Huo Zhao snapped, being insulted repeatedly by a Great Ascension Realm cultivator, where was he supposed to put his face?
With that, Huo Zhao returned a punch of his own!
Both of them stripped it back to basics, no weapons, just pure brute force clashing head-on!
Boom!
With one punch, the entirety of Wuwang Land warped, and both Chen Ping and Huo Zhao vanished, seemingly sucked into the distorted void!
Everyone stared in stunned silence, unable to sense even a trace of Chen Ping or Huo Zhao’s presence!
Lin Chong and the others began to worry, though Chen Ping had jumped two realms, the gap between him and Huo Zhao was still massive!
Ming Shao gazed into the void from afar, his brows knitted, the smug look on his face fading a bit!
“Master Huo, this elder of your family isn’t going to lose to Chen Ping, a mere Great Ascension cultivator, is he?” Qian Xiaohan asked Huo Zhenfeng!
“No way, the Huo Family’s main line are all in the Celestial Realm, all immortals, how could they not beat Chen Ping?” Huo Zhenfeng shook his head, refusing to believe an immortal from the Celestial Realm couldn’t handle a Great Ascension cultivator!
That would be far too ridiculous!
But now, no one could detect Chen Ping or Huo Zhao, not even their auras, no one knew where they’d gone to fight through that warped void!
“Master Qian, do you have any more reinforcements?” Ming Shao asked Qian Xiaohan!
The Huo Family had used their token to summon an elder, now it was Qian Sect’s turn!
“I can too…”
Qian Xiaohan replied, his fingers began to weave signs, and slowly, a Bagua diagram appeared in the heavens!
Everyone looked up, watching as a burly giant of a man emerged from the Bagua diagram, wielding a meteor hammer, stepping out slowly!
This giant stood a hundred metres tall, like a small mountain.
With each step he took, the earth trembled!
The crowd was left dumbfounded at the sight!
“Who summoned me?” the giant bellowed, scanning the area below!
“Guardian Lord, I am the Sect Master of Qian Sect, I called you forth because Qian Sect is in peril!” Qian Xiaohan hurried forward, bowing respectfully!
The Guardian glanced at Qian Xiaohan and nodded, “You do wield the art of cosmic deduction, no mistake there, tell me who it is, I’ll squash them flat!”
His voice boomed like thunder, his face full of disdain as he surveyed the crowd!
“It’s a guy named Chen Ping, when he shows up, please hammer him dead, Guardian Lord!” Qian Xiaohan said!
“No problem!” The Guardian nodded, “Since I’ve promised to guard Qian Sect for three thousand years, I’ll definitely get it done.”
At that moment, Li Chunfeng glanced at Nan Batian, “Batian, you can grow big too, take on this guy, compare sizes, you’ll scare him to death.”
“Hold on, let me rest a bit first, eat some immortal spirit stones!”
Nan Batian replied, absorbing immortal spirit stones to restore his strength!
Once fully recovered, he could also grow to a hundred metres tall, fearless of this giant!
