“What methods are there to detoxify?” Chen Ping asked hurriedly.
Mo Chen looked at Chen Ping, then at the unconscious Ling Xue. After hesitating for a moment, he said: “This poison needs to be neutralised with supreme yang power; ordinary pills are ineffective… The best way is through the union of man and woman, guiding with one’s own spiritual power…”
As soon as these words came out, Chen Ping was immediately stunned.
Hu Mazi’s eyes flashed with golden light. He very much wanted to volunteer himself; he was a man and could help.
“I will first go to handle the matters outside. Chen Ping… take care of yourself.”
After saying that, Mo Chen dragged Hu Mazi away in a hurry, as if staying one second longer would be awkward.
Hu Mazi did not want to leave, but being pulled by Mo Chen, he had no choice.
In an instant, only the two of them were left in the courtyard.
Chen Ping looked at Ling Xue lying on the ground. Her breathing became increasingly rapid; her cheeks were so red they seemed about to drip blood. Unconsciously, she tore at her own clothes, revealing her snow-white neck.
A wave of heat rose from his dantian. Chen Ping swallowed, forcibly suppressing the stirring in his heart.
He knew now was not the time to think about these things, but Li Chunfeng’s words kept echoing in his mind.
“I must save her.” Chen Ping gritted his teeth, picked up Ling Xue, and walked into the room.
He gently placed her on the bed. Chen Ping turned to go find Hu Mazi to think of other ways, but his wrist was firmly grasped.
“Chen Ping…” Ling Xue opened her eyes in a daze; her gaze was blurred. She murmured: “Do not leave…”
Her hand was scorching hot and soft; that touch made Chen Ping’s whole body stiffen.
“Ling Xue, hold on. I will go find an antidote for you…”
“It is useless…”
Ling Xue shook her head gently; her other hand hooked around his neck. Breathing like orchids, she said: “I know… only you can save me…”
The warm breath sprayed on his ear, carrying the unique fragrance of a young girl, causing Chen Ping’s reason to collapse instantly.
He looked at Ling Xue’s watery big eyes, which clearly reflected his own figure.
“Are you… willing?” Chen Ping’s voice was somewhat hoarse.
Ling Xue did not answer; she just stood on tiptoe and gently kissed his lips.
Like a spark igniting dry wood, the long-suppressed emotions instantly erupted.
The candlelight in the room flickered, illuminating the entwined figures. The moonlight outside the window became hazy at some point, as if draping a layer of gentle veil over this pair of lovers who had endured hardships.
This night was destined to be sleepless.
The next morning, the first ray of sunlight shone into the room through the window lattice.
Chen Ping slowly opened his eyes, looking at the sleeping Ling Xue in his arms. Her face still carried the unfaded flush; her long eyelashes trembled gently, like a butterfly taking a short rest.
Last night’s madness was like a dream. Upon waking, only the room full of charm and a faint sense of guilt remained. He gently tucked the quilt corner for Ling Xue and got up to walk to the window.
The courtyard had already returned to calm; the traces of last night’s fight had been cleaned up thoroughly. Only the faint bloody smell lingering in the air reminded him of everything that had happened.
“Senior Brother Chen Ping.” Ling Xue’s voice came from behind, carrying a trace of laziness and shyness.
Chen Ping turned around and saw that she had already dressed, but her cheeks were still bright red, not daring to look directly into his eyes.
“How do you feel?” Chen Ping stepped forward and reached out to check her pulse.
The moment spiritual power surged in, Chen Ping breathed a sigh of relief. The toxins in Ling Xue’s body had been completely cleared; even because she absorbed his bloodline, her cultivation faintly showed signs of breaking through to the fourth grade of the Earth Immortal Realm.
“Much better, thank you.” Ling Xue lowered her head; her voice was as faint as a mosquito’s hum.
At that moment, Hu Mazi ran in noisily: “Chen Ping! It is bad! Qin Lie has brought people to kill!”
Chen Ping’s face darkened: “He has come at the right time.”
He exchanged a glance with Ling Xue and walked out of the room together.
Outside the Sword Sect’s residence, it had already been surrounded by densely packed cultivators.
Leading them was Qin Lie; his eyes were bloodshot, and terrifying aura emanated from his body. Clearly, he had learned of Qin Feng’s encounter.
Behind him stood more than a dozen elders dressed differently; each had a powerful aura, obviously the leaders of various sects.
