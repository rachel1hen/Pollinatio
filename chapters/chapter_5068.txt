Initially, Chen Ping wanted to force open the coffin but feared damaging its contents.
The runes on the coffin were unique, not formation runes but more like a seal.
Hu Mazi was an expert in such sealing charms, which is why Chen Ping sought him out.
“Damn, you’re so unlucky, bringing a coffin here?”
Hu Mazi frowned upon seeing it!
“Master Hu, this coffin is a treasure…” Chen Ping recounted the events at the ruins to Hu Mazi.
Hearing this, Hu Mazi’s interest piqued, and he closely examined the coffin and its runes.
“This coffin is sealed, not to prevent opening but to keep something inside from escaping.”
“These sealing runes are meant to suppress whatever’s in there.”
Hu Mazi said after a thorough inspection.
“Master Hu, are you saying there’s a person inside?” Chen Ping was shocked.
“Just a guess, let’s open it and see!”
Hu Mazi placed his right hand on the coffin, chanting softly. Instantly, the runes began to tremble and disintegrate!
Seeing this, Chen Ping grew tense!
He gripped the Dragon-Slaying Sword.
If something dangerous emerged, he’d act immediately.
As the runes dissolved, the coffin started to shake. Chen Ping pulled Hu Mazi back, and they watched silently.
Soon, a gap opened in the coffin, and a startlingly pale hand reached out.
Seeing the hand, it was clear a person was inside.
Chen Ping held the Dragon-Slaying Sword, ready for action.
Hu Mazi quickly drew a charm with his blood essence, prepared to suppress whatever emerged.
As they watched the coffin tensely, two wisps of black mist suddenly emerged from Chen Ping’s body!
The two ancient warriors appeared without warning.
After they appeared, the pale hand froze, then retracted, closing the coffin again!
Chen Ping was puzzled. Why had the ancient warriors emerged unbidden?
Was it because of the coffin?
With no choice, Chen Ping recalled the warriors into his body, then said to the coffin, “Come out, it’s safe now!”
Since it was a person inside, there was room to negotiate.
But despite Chen Ping’s words, the coffin remained still.
Chen Ping stepped forward to open it, but after several attempts, it seemed locked from within, immovable.
“Damn it, I don’t believe this…”
Chen Ping raised the Dragon-Slaying Sword, intending to cut it open.
“Kid, reseal the coffin. If what’s inside comes out, you’re done for.”
At that moment, the Red Cloud Demon Lord spoke in Chen Ping’s mind.
Chen Ping paused and asked, “Senior, do you know what’s inside?”
“I don’t, but I know if you open it, you’re in trouble.”
The Red Cloud Demon Lord said.
Chen Ping gave up on forcing it open, instructing Hu Mazi to reapply the sealing charms.
Storing the coffin back in his storage ring, Chen Ping decided to wait until he was stronger to open it.
Since it was a person, not a treasure or resource, his interest waned.
Just as Chen Ping stored the coffin, someone approached him.
“Mr. Chen, the Mysterious Lady requests your presence!”
The messenger said to Chen Ping.
Chen Ping was puzzled, wondering why Lan Lianhua wanted him.
When he reached the main hall, both Lan Lianhua and Mo Qingyun were there!
“Mysterious Lady, what’s the matter?” Chen Ping asked.
