After all, every teleportation array operates differently. Though Chen Ping was skilled in array techniques, he wasn’t guaranteed to activate someone else’s array.
“Don’t underestimate my son-in-law, he’s capable of anything.”
Bai Yi said to Mad Immortal!
“Quick, get into the array, I’ll activate it.”
“This thing, it’s child’s play to me…”
Chen Ping said confidently, without a hint of exaggeration!
Everyone entered the teleportation array. As Chen Ping’s fingertips traced through the air, the array truly activated, and with a flash of white light, their figures vanished instantly.
Soon, as Chen Ping and the others looked around, they found themselves in a completely different courtyard!
The courtyard was surrounded by walls built from red boulders, towering a hundred metres high.
The surroundings were deathly silent, not a single soul in sight!
But before Chen Ping and his group could react, the red walls around them began to move slowly.
Then, one by one, battle soldiers emerged from behind the walls.
Young Master Huo strode forward, his face full of cold arrogance.
“How bold, daring to use a teleportation array to trespass into the temple. Are you not afraid of death?”
After speaking, Young Master Huo suddenly frowned, “Humans?”
His gaze fell on Aisha.
“Young Master, these people are likely fugitives who accidentally triggered the teleportation array and ended up here.”
A battle soldier captain stepped forward and reported to Young Master Huo.
Young Master Huo stared at them with a chilling expression, then snorted coldly, “Useless fools, what are you good for, letting fugitives escape to my domain?”
“Seize them and send them back immediately…”
Young Master Huo said indifferently.
Boom!
The surrounding battle soldiers sprang into action, their released auras firmly suppressing Chen Ping and his group.
These soldiers were all elites, their strength noticeably higher than those from other cities.
This was evident from the auras they unleashed.
“Damn it, looks like we’ll have to fight for our lives…”
Seeing this, Mad Immortal’s aura erupted instantly, ready to go on a killing spree.
Bai Yi and Aisha also prepared for battle!
Niu Ben, looking nervous, hid behind Chen Ping, after all, he was just a child.
“Leave it to me…”
As Chen Ping spoke, he raised his palm, and a ripple immediately spread through the entire space!
Soon, all the battle soldiers in the area froze in place.
It was as if time itself had stopped in that moment.
Young Master Huo, seeing this, widened his eyes in disbelief.
Over a hundred battle soldiers were now suspended in mid-air in eerie poses. He turned to flee, but as the ripple passed over him, his body became completely immobile, the entire space frozen.
No matter how much strength he used or how much immortal energy he unleashed, he couldn’t move an inch.
At this moment, Chen Ping’s face was ashen, a faint glow emanating from his palm.
“Time manipulation?” Mad Immortal’s eyes widened, “Big brother, you can actually control time? That’s incredible!”
But Chen Ping ignored him and said, “Hurry, prepare, we’re going back…”
Manipulating time consumed a tremendous amount of Chen Ping’s time origin, so he couldn’t maintain it for long.
Now, Chen Ping needed to take them back through the array. Breaking out from here would be too difficult!
After all, this small city was likely filled with many members of the Eight Temples.
With a flash of white light, Chen Ping and his group vanished, returning through the teleportation array.
The moment Chen Ping disappeared, the entire space shuddered, and everyone crashed to the ground!
Young Master Huo’s figure swayed, nearly falling!
“This guy actually knows time manipulation. We must capture him, pursue them!”
Young Master Huo commanded, leading his men into the teleportation array!
Since the array was small, it could only transport a few people at a time, making it impractical to send all the soldiers.
Young Master Huo took only a few battle soldiers and chased after Chen Ping through the teleportation array.
