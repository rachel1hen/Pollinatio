Just as Chen Ping was about to speak, the woman with the blue hairpin cut him off, saying, “I know, you definitely don’t know any aura-hiding techniques, but no worries, I’ve got a concealment talisman here, just wear it on you, and it’ll mask your aura, no one will be able to tell your real strength.”
The blue hairpin woman pulled out a talisman, waving it at Chen Ping!
Seeing this, Chen Ping burst into a grin, he got it now, this was why she’d been buttering him up—she was trying to sell him the concealment talisman!
“You giving me this talisman for free?” Chen Ping asked on purpose!
“No way, this talisman was hand-drawn by a senior talisman master, I spent a ton of resources to get it.”
“But if you want it, I could let you have some, though I can’t just give it away for nothing!”
“If it were anyone else, no matter how many resources they offered, I wouldn’t sell, but you’ve got a clear brow and bright eyes, I like your vibe, so I’m willing to part with a few.”
The blue hairpin woman said!
“Sis, we don’t have many of these talismans left, how can you just give them away? We paid a huge price to get a talisman master to make these!”
“What’ll we use if you give them up?”
The red hairpin woman hurriedly tried to stop her!
“Little sis, this fellow’s realm is too low, I can’t bear to see him get hurt, so let’s give him some!”
The blue hairpin woman insisted!
“No way…” The red hairpin woman protested fiercely!
Chen Ping watched their over-the-top act and couldn’t help but smirk!
How’d this Celestial Human Realm have scams like this too?
“Since this stuff’s so precious to you, I’ll pass, can’t put you sisters in a tough spot!”
Chen Ping decided to mess with the twins a bit, turning to leave after speaking!
That threw the twin sisters for a loop!
They’d planned to put on a show for Chen Ping, hoping to jack up the price of the talisman!
But now Chen Ping was just walking off!
“Hey, hey, hey…” The blue hairpin woman chased after him, “Fellow Daoist, don’t go, my little sis doesn’t get it, how about I cut you a deal on the talisman?”
“How much?” Chen Ping asked!
“How’s ten thousand immortal spirit stones per talisman?” The blue hairpin woman offered!
“Ten thousand immortal spirit stones?” Chen Ping blinked, “For that lousy talisman, worth ten thousand? Why don’t you just rob me instead…”
“Fellow Daoist, if you think it’s too pricey, we can haggle!”
The blue hairpin woman grinned!
“Nah, forget it…” Chen Ping said, starting to turn away!
But before he could, the red hairpin woman whipped out her sword, aiming it straight at Chen Ping!
“You asked, so you’re buying, or don’t blame me for getting rough!”
The red hairpin woman unleashed her Ninth-Grade Mahayana Realm aura!
“So this is a forced sale now?” Chen Ping chuckled!
“Exactly, we’re not unreasonable, you buy our talisman with your immortal spirit stones, it’s a fair trade.”
“If it were anyone else, we’d have just killed you with one swing and taken your stuff!”
The blue hairpin woman added!
“First time I’ve heard strong-arming dressed up so noble, I’ve got immortal spirit stones, but I’m not buying your talisman!”
Chen Ping smirked lightly!
“Kid, you’re not afraid to die?” The blue hairpin woman frowned!
“Afraid, sure, but you two can’t kill me!”
Chen Ping said!
“Hmph, a Third-Grade Mahayana Realm punk like you, spouting big talk, forget both of us, I could send you to the afterlife with one slash!” The red hairpin woman sneered!
“Oh yeah? I don’t buy it, wanna try?”
Chen Ping taunted, beckoning the red hairpin woman with a wave!
“Courting death…”
She lunged, sword poised to strike Chen Ping!
“Stop it, both of you scram, this guy’s mine…”
A roar cut through, and a young man in a brocade robe strode up, a jade pendant at his waist, folding fan in hand!
Trailing him were two cold-eyed cultivators!
