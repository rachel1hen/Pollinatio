The woman in white robes sneered upon seeing this, “Arrogant fool.”
She turned to the three black-robed elders behind her, “Let’s go too, don’t let them get ahead.”
The man in green hesitated for a moment but ultimately followed Tianci’s group.
After all, in such an unknown environment, sticking with the strong was safer than acting alone.
Chen Ping stood in place, his gaze sweeping the surroundings, a slight smirk on his lips.
“Interesting…”
He muttered to himself before following along.
This chaotic space seemed disorderly, but Chen Ping could faintly sense some kind of pattern.
His divine sense far surpassed that of cultivators of the same rank, even more acute than those at the fifth grade of the Loose Immortal Realm.
…
Deep within the chaos.
After walking for about half an hour, the mist ahead suddenly thinned, revealing a dilapidated stone platform in front of the group.
Atop the platform were three coffins, all blood-red and adorned with mysterious, peculiar symbols.
On either side of the platform stood two armoured warriors holding large blades!
However, these warriors were merely stone statues, though carved so vividly they seemed almost alive.
Seeing this, everyone was puzzled, unsure who might be inside these coffins.
Chen Ping was also filled with curiosity, as his divine sense could not penetrate the coffins at all, and the blood-red coffins emitted a strong stench of blood.
Everyone kept their distance from the broken stone platform, as no one knew if it posed any danger.
This ruin was filled with an eerie atmosphere, so everyone remained extremely cautious.
Mo Qingyun instinctively moved closer to Chen Ping, half her body hiding behind him.
Her heart was filled with some fear, and only standing by Chen Ping gave her a sense of security.
Seeing this, Tianci was instantly enraged, as Mo Qingyun was walking too close to Chen Ping.
But in front of Elder Tong and the people from the Asura Hall, Tianci didn’t dare act recklessly, so he suppressed his anger and forced a faint smile, “It seems there’s some secret in these coffins. We should send someone to investigate first.”
Everyone glanced at Tianci, especially the woman in white, who rolled her eyes and said, “Then you go investigate…”
Tianci shook his head, “I’m not going!”
With that, he looked at Chen Ping and said, “You go investigate…”
Chen Ping was taken aback, “Why don’t you go?”
“I’m afraid it’s dangerous,” Tianci said unabashedly.
“Well, I’m afraid it’s dangerous too,” Chen Ping replied, somewhat displeased.
“If you don’t go, I’ll beat you to death. My strength is greater than yours.”
“Go investigate or die, your choice,” Tianci asked.
“Damn…” Chen Ping was speechless.
“Brother Tianci, he…” Mo Qingyun tried to plead for Chen Ping.
“Little sister Qingyun, don’t say anything. He’s just a follower, you don’t need to protect him all the time.”
Tianci was somewhat displeased.
Seeing this, Mo Qingyun gave Chen Ping a helpless glance.
Chen Ping knew that in this world, the weak were prey to the strong. Who could blame him for only being at the first grade of the Loose Immortal Realm?
The woman in white glanced at Chen Ping, a playful smile on her face.
“A first-grade Loose Immortal coming here, how is that any different from seeking death?”
The woman in white laughed.
Chen Ping just smiled, saying nothing, and walked straight towards the dilapidated stone platform.
“I’ll go with you…”
Seeing this, Mo Qingyun chased after Chen Ping.
“Sister Qingyun…”
Tianci tried to stop her but saw that Mo Qingyun had already caught up with Chen Ping.
Tianci’s face turned green with anger, his eyes wide, teeth grinding.
“Why are you coming with me? What if it’s dangerous?”
Chen Ping looked at Mo Qingyun and asked.
