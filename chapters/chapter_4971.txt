“Sit down…”
Upon entering the room, Xie Zhong gestured for Chen Ping to take a seat.
Shortly after, someone brought tea, and the person serving it was none other than Li Tianbao, the manager of Rhino City’s Tianbao Pavilion.
At this moment, Li Tianbao had resumed his true identity, now a core figure in Flying Tiger City.
“I didn’t expect Lord Niu to send you!”
Li Tianbao said, somewhat surprised upon seeing Chen Ping.
“Does it matter who comes?”
Chen Ping replied with a double entendre.
Li Tianbao smiled faintly, “Indeed, if Lord Niu himself had come, I wouldn’t know how to face him.”
“Each serves their own master, you’re not at fault. If someone else had taken Niu Ben, he might’ve suffered. At the very least, you wouldn’t let that happen,” Chen Ping said.
Li Tianbao’s expression shifted slightly at these words, and he turned to leave.
“Niu Ben is doing well here, you can rest assured. I only want resources and territory, I’ve no interest in Niu Ben’s life.”
After Li Tianbao left, Xie Zhong spoke to Chen Ping.
“State your terms…” Chen Ping asked.
“The treasure land belongs to Flying Tiger City!” Xie Zhong declared.
“No problem!” Chen Ping nodded without hesitation.
The treasure land was now a dead zone, devoid of any riches, so Chen Ping could easily agree.
Seeing Chen Ping agree so readily, Xie Zhong grew suspicious.
“Lord Xie, no need to wonder why I agreed so quickly.”
“The treasure land still needs time to be opened. Right now, it’s a wasteland, inaccessible to anyone, so it’s not important to Lord Niu.”
Chen Ping explained.
Xie Zhong nodded, “Fair enough, but I don’t just want the treasure land. I also want one million immortal coins, plus a hundred years’ worth of resources from the three southern territories of Rhino City!”
“Agreed…” Chen Ping nodded.
Xie Zhong was stunned, “Can you really make these decisions?”
“Of course. Lord Niu sent me with full authority to agree to any terms you propose.”
Chen Ping said.
“Do you even know how much a million immortal coins and a century’s resources from those three southern territories are worth?”
Xie Zhong asked in disbelief.
“I don’t, but I know immortal coins can be earned again, resources can be regrown, but a son’s life, once lost, is gone forever.”
Chen Ping said calmly.
Xie Zhong stared at Chen Ping, utterly perplexed. He had expected a back-and-forth, even prepared his bottom line.
Negotiations were supposed to involve give and take, weren’t they?
But now, Chen Ping’s swift agreement left Xie Zhong at a loss, feeling as though Chen Ping wasn’t playing by the rules.
“Can you truly decide?” Xie Zhong asked again.
“Of course, but since I’ve agreed to your terms, you must let me see Niu Ben. Without seeing him, all our talk is meaningless, isn’t it?”
Chen Ping said.
“Fair point!” Xie Zhong nodded, then clapped his hands lightly. Li Tianbao, who had left earlier, returned with Niu Ben.
Niu Ben’s face was pale, clearly terrified. When he saw Chen Ping, his expression filled with confusion.
“Niu Ben, don’t be afraid. I’m here to take you home.”
Chen Ping stepped forward, gently patting Niu Ben’s shoulder.
As he did, a wisp of energy was subtly infused into Niu Ben’s body.
“Brother Chen, did my father send you?” Niu Ben asked.
“Indeed, you’ll be home soon…” Chen Ping nodded.
Niu Ben finally managed a faint smile, visibly relieved.
Xie Zhong waved his hand, signalling Li Tianbao to take Niu Ben away, then turned to Chen Ping, “You’ve seen him. Now, where are the resources and immortal coins I demanded?”
