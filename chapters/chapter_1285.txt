Ning Dahai waved his hands rapidly, soon forming a massive red seal between them.
“Even if it exhausts my lifelong cultivation, I will slay you…”
Ning Dahai’s face was grim, the seal in his hands growing ever brighter.
“Is Ning Dahai mad? He’s actually burning his essence blood?”
“I reckon he knows he can’t handle Chen Ping without doing this!”
“He’s doomed either way, is Ning Dahai planning to take Chen Ping down with him?”
The crowd, witnessing Ning Dahai’s actions, was utterly shocked.
After all, reaching the rank of Martial Marquis was no small feat, especially for a veteran like Ning Dahai, which made it even more extraordinary.
To burn one’s essence blood and expend a lifetime’s cultivation was something most could not bring themselves to do.
“This is Ning Dahai’s Blood Demon Seal, he’s using his essence blood to summon a blood demon to fight!”
“But after casting this technique, even if he survives, he’ll be a cripple.”
“Chen Ping is in danger now…”
Someone recognised the technique Ning Dahai was using and commented calmly.
Hearing this, everyone widened their eyes, eager not to miss a single thrilling moment.
Chen Ping observed Ning Dahai’s state and the increasingly radiant seal, his brows slightly furrowed.
He could sense a thick aura of death emanating from the seal.
It was as if a demon lurked within, ready to burst forth at any moment.
Soon, the blood-red seal grew larger, eventually shining as brightly as a mirror!
Within the seal, a ferocious beast with jagged fangs was roaring.
The onlookers stared in astonishment, their eyes filled with disbelief, as none had ever seen Ning Dahai unleash the Blood Demon Seal.
“With my blood as a sacrifice, grant me boundless power…”
Ning Dahai bellowed at the beast within the seal.
Moments later, the seal shattered, and the fanged beast charged out.
This startled the crowd, with many of the faint-hearted fleeing in terror.
Blood dripped continuously from the beast’s body, its terrifying aura making it hard for the onlookers to breathe.
“Go, kill…”
Ning Dahai pointed at Chen Ping, then bit his fingertip, flicking a drop of blood onto the beast’s forehead.
“Roar…”
The beast let out a furious roar, its eyes, like bronze bells, fixed on Chen Ping.
Its massive form then soared into the sky, charging towards Chen Ping like a mountain.
Rumble…
The beast’s enormous body bore down on Chen Ping.
The stench of blood and murderous intent filled the air, and as the beast leaped, it stirred a boundless storm, the fierce winds carrying its bloody aura ever closer to Chen Ping.
Before this colossal beast, Chen Ping’s figure seemed pitifully small.
As Chen Ping faced the giant beast, golden light flickered across his body, the Dragon Crystal within him radiating divine dragon power.
Chen Ping channelled all his divine dragon power, releasing it from his body!
The divine dragon power transformed into a golden dragon, which then coiled above Chen Ping’s head!
The crowd, witnessing this extraordinary scene, was once again left dumbfounded by Chen Ping.
As the beast charged forward, the golden dragon above Chen Ping’s head let out a dragon’s roar before rushing towards the beast.
It was clear that, as the golden dragon charged, the beast’s body visibly faltered for a moment.
Rumble…
The golden dragon’s form collided with the beast in an instant.
In that moment, the heavens and earth trembled, the great dao resounded, and the world itself quaked.
The energy unleashed by the clash of the golden dragon and the beast was far beyond what a battle between two Martial Marquises could produce.
