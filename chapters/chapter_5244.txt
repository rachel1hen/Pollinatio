Chen Ping and Hu Mazi followed the crowd into Sword Saint City, where the sights were even more striking than outside.
The wide streets were paved with dark green stone, lined with buildings adorned with sword-related signs like “Sword Forging Workshop” or “Sword Scripture Pavilion.”
Most of the passersby, eight or nine out of ten, carried swords at their waists or on their backs. Even in ordinary clothes, they exuded a sharp, cutting aura.
“Blimey, this place has some serious character. Just walking here makes me feel on edge,” Hu Mazi muttered, instinctively touching his talisman pouch. Compared to the sword cultivators around, his gear looked out of place.
Chen Ping scanned the surroundings, saying gravely, “Let’s find a place to settle first, then gather information slowly.”
They walked for about the time it takes an incense stick to burn before choosing an inn called “Welcome House.”
The inn was sizable, its entrance marked by two crossed giant sword models, exuding a bold air.
As they entered, a waiter greeted them warmly, “Welcome, sirs! Dining or staying?”
“Staying. Two superior rooms,” Chen Ping said.
“Right away!” The waiter swiftly registered them and led them to the second floor.
The rooms were clean and tidy, with windows facing the street, offering a clear view of the bustling scene outside.
After settling in, Hu Mazi plopped onto a chair, gulping down tea, “Chen Ping, with so many sword cultivators in this city, could there be people from the Evil Path Hall?”
“Hard to say,” Chen Ping stood by the window, gazing at the lively crowd, “The Evil Path Hall operates in secrecy. Even if they have a branch here in this sword cultivator haven, they wouldn’t be overt. We need to tread carefully and find a local to ask about the situation.”
Just then, Chen Ping’s brows furrowed slightly. He sensed a faint presence trailing them, lingering ever since they entered the city.
“What’s wrong?” Hu Mazi noticed Chen Ping’s change and asked.
“We’re being followed,” Chen Ping said quietly, “Since the city gate.”
Hu Mazi tensed, “That brocade-robed Zhao Tianyi? Or someone from the Evil Path Hall?”
“Neither,” Chen Ping shook his head, “It’s a female cultivator, familiar aura. Likely the white-robed woman from the gate.”
Hu Mazi blinked, “Why’s she following us? Because you disrupted her sword intent duel?”
“Possibly.”
Chen Ping’s eyes flickered, “Her sword intent is pure, and her strength isn’t weak. Let’s not alert her yet and see what she wants.”
They stayed in the room for about half an hour before Chen Ping stood, “Come on, let’s explore and find a place to gather information.”
Hu Mazi nodded, following Chen Ping out of the inn.
As they turned a corner, a white-robed figure suddenly appeared, blocking their path.
It was the female cultivator from the gate, no longer ethereal but now gazing at Chen Ping with scrutiny.
“Who are you? Why did you interfere with my sword intent duel with Qin Feng of Divine Sword Manor?” she demanded, her voice cold and questioning.
Chen Ping looked at her. She was tall, stunningly beautiful, her white robes immaculate, her sword faintly glowing with a chilly light.
“Just passing by, an unintentional act,” Chen Ping replied calmly.
“Unintentional?”
She clearly didn’t believe him, “Your sword intent was subtle, but I sensed a unique charm in it, far from accidental. Who are you, really? How do you have such pure sword intent?”
“I’m Chen Ping. As for the sword intent, just something I picked up,” Chen Ping answered evenly.
The female cultivator sized him up, noting his Loose Immortal Realm cultivation, her eyes flashing with doubt, “Such sword intent at Loose Immortal Realm? Do you take me for a child?”
Before her words faded, she moved. Her sword turned into a white arc, carrying sharp sword energy, thrusting toward Chen Ping!
