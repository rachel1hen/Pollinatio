Chen Ping complied and took off his outer robe, revealing a shallow wound on his left arm. That was from when the black-robed man self-detonated, scratched by flying debris. Although not deep, it still retained a trace of evil qi.
Ling Xue saw the wound, a flash of heartache passed through her eyes. She carefully dipped a cloth in the spiritual water, gently wiping the bloodstains around the wound. Her movements were so soft, as if afraid to hurt him.
The warmth of the spiritual water intertwined with the fresh fragrance of the immortal herbs. A comfortable warmth came from the wound, the remaining evil qi also gradually dissipated.
“Senior Brother, you must be more careful next time.”
Ling Xue applied the healing medicine while speaking softly, her voice carrying a bit of choking. “I know you are very powerful, but I still worry… worry that something happens to you, worry that I will never see you again…”
Chen Ping looked at her lowered eyelids, her long eyelashes trembling slightly. His heart softened, he raised his hand and gently stroked her hair. “Silly girl, I promise you, I will be more careful in the future.”
Ling Xue raised her head, her eyes full of tears, yet she forcibly held them back from falling. “Senior Brother, I heard from Master, you are going with Master Hu to find the main hall of the Evil Path Palace, right?”
Chen Ping’s heart startled, then he nodded. “Yes. The divine souls of the Hu clan are in the main hall, I cannot let Master Hu go alone. Moreover, the Sixth Hall Master of the God Palace has repeatedly targeted me, the God Palace Sixth Hall in the Sixth Heaven, I must go there too.”
Ling Xue bit her lip, silent for a moment, then slowly said. “I know, I cannot stop you. You have your aspirations, things you need to do, I cannot become your burden.”
She took a deep breath, a flash of firmness passed through her eyes. “I will cultivate well in Sword Saint City, wait for you to return. When I become stronger, next time we encounter danger, I can fight alongside you!”
Looking at the firmness in her eyes, Chen Ping’s heart was deeply touched.
He knew, Ling Xue was no longer that little girl who needed his constant protection. She had her own growth, her own pride.
“Good.”
Chen Ping smiled and nodded. “I will wait for you to become stronger, then we can fight side by side.”
As night deepened, the Sword Sect residence gradually quieted down. Only occasional insect chirps and the spiritual power fluctuations from disciples cultivating could be heard.
Ling Xue did not leave, she sat beside Chen Ping, organising the luggage he would take tomorrow. Several bottles of healing medicine, and immortal herbs she had picked herself.
While organising, she nagged on. “Senior Brother, the immortal qi in the Sixth Heaven is denser than in the Fifth Heaven, when cultivating, pay attention to controlling spiritual power, do not be greedy;
When encountering unfamiliar demon beasts, must observe clearly first, do not act rashly;
Also, take this bottle of ‘Clear Heart Pill’ with you, if you encounter evil qi invasion, it can help stabilise your mind…”
Chen Ping listened patiently, occasionally nodding in agreement.
He knew, behind these instructions, was Ling Xue’s full reluctance and concern.
“Ling Xue,” Chen Ping interrupted her words, his voice low and gentle. “After I handle the matters in the Sixth Heaven, find the main hall of the Evil Path Palace, I will definitely come back to find you.”
Ling Xue stopped her actions, raised her head to look at him, her eyes full of attachment. “Senior Brother, I will wait for you. No matter how long, I will wait for you.”
She stood up, gently threw herself into Chen Ping’s arms, her hands tightly hugging his waist, her cheek pressed against his chest, feeling his steady heartbeat.
Chen Ping raised his hand to hug her, the tip of his nose surrounded by the fresh fragrance of her hair, his heart full of softness.
“Senior Brother,” Ling Xue’s voice was muffled. “I… I want you to remember me.”
Chen Ping lowered his head, looking at the top of the person in his arms’ head, said softly. “I will never forget you.”
As the night grew thicker, the lights in the room flickered, reflecting two embracing figures, full of reluctance and warmth.
“Does anywhere else still hurt?” Chen Ping looked at Ling Xue tenderly and asked!
