Boom…
The edges of the Floating Island began to crumble, massive rocks crashing to the ground like meteors, kicking up clouds of dust.
“Run! The Floating Island is going to crash!”
Countless cultivators scattered in panic, the scene descending into chaos.
Just as everyone thought doomsday had arrived, two figures suddenly shot out from the centre of the Floating Island!
“It’s Mr. Chen! And Qingyun!”
Lan Lianhua’s beautiful eyes narrowed, immediately leading her people to meet them.
“Mr. Chen, what on earth happened?” she asked urgently.
Chen Ping steadied himself and said gravely, “The Floating Island was never truly an island, but an entrance to a ruin. Now that the ruin has collapsed, it can no longer hold.”
“What?” The crowd was stunned.
“This isn’t the place to talk, let’s head back first!”
Chen Ping said.
Lan Lianhua nodded, then led Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun back to her palace.
Chen Ping recounted everything to Lan Lianhua in detail.
After hearing it, Lan Lianhua let out a sigh of regret.
“This Floating Island has been in our Cangxuan Continent for years, and we never realised it was a ruin’s entrance.”
Lan Lianhua said with deep regret.
Noticing a significant change in Chen Ping’s aura, she asked curiously, “Chen Ping… what realm are you at now?”
Chen Ping smiled faintly, “Third Grade Loose Immortal.”
“What?!”
Lan Lianhua was utterly shocked!
Before entering the ruin, Chen Ping was only a First Grade Loose Immortal. In just two days, he had broken through multiple realms to reach Third Grade Loose Immortal?
Such cultivation speed was unheard of!
Chen Ping only smiled, saying nothing more. If he elaborated, Lan Lianhua might feel even more regret.
The opportunities were meant for the Cangxuan Continent, yet no one had discovered the Floating Island was a ruin’s entrance, missing out entirely.
“Mysterious Lady, how’s Huo Jingjing doing?” Chen Ping asked Lan Lianhua.
After what happened with Huo Jingjing, Chen Ping had left, unsure of how she was faring.
Given the temperament of the Divine Clan, Huo Jingjing might even take her own life, unable to bear being touched by someone from what they considered an inferior race.
“She’s doing well, no longer making a fuss, eating on time every day.”
“But she’s asked to see you a few times. I told her you weren’t here!”
Lan Lianhua said.
Chen Ping was taken aback, puzzled. Could it be that Huo Jingjing, after what he did to her, didn’t hate him?
So, Chen Ping stood and decided to check on Huo Jingjing.
Arriving at the dungeon, Chen Ping saw Huo Jingjing sitting quietly.
When she saw Chen Ping, Huo Jingjing stood, not showing the rage he had expected.
“Chen Ping…”
Huo Jingjing looked at him with complex emotions.
Unlike her initial arrogance, her eyes now held a trace of softness.
“What?” Chen Ping raised an eyebrow, asking brusquely.
To deal with such a prideful woman, he needed to overpower her with his presence.
Huo Jingjing bit her lip and said softly, “You… what have you been doing these past two days?”
“What I do is none of your business. Do I need to report to you?”
Chen Ping said coldly.
“No, no, no, I didn’t mean to pry, it’s just that my mind’s been a mess these past two days.”
Huo Jingjing quickly waved her hands.
“Why?” Chen Ping studied her, “Is it because I took you, and it’s messed with your head?”
“Yes!” Huo Jingjing nodded.
“I’m sorry, I acted on impulse,” Chen Ping said.
“You don’t owe me an apology,” Huo Jingjing shook her head, “Can you come in and sit with me for a bit?”
Chen Ping hesitated briefly, then nodded and opened the cell door.
As soon as he stepped in and closed the door, Huo Jingjing suddenly turned and threw herself into his arms!
“Chen Ping, I… I think I’ve fallen for you,” Huo Jingjing said, looking at him.
