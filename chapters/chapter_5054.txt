Hearing the old man’s words, everyone was stunned, their faces full of disbelief.
None of them had expected that the Third Heaven was created by the old man before them.
In the past, the Heavenly Realm only had thirty-three heavens. To create a world within it showed the old man’s strength, no wonder it was called the Gantian Sect.
It truly seemed to have defied the heavens.
After all, none of those present knew about events from tens of thousands of years ago, nor could they tell if the old man’s words were true.
“Senior, is what this old man said true?”
Chen Ping could only ask the Red Cloud Demon Lord in his sea of consciousness.
After all, this being resided in the Ninth Heaven and had lived for many years, so he might know more.
But before Chen Ping could finish his question in his sea of consciousness, the mysterious old man smiled faintly and said, “No need to ask the soul in your sea of consciousness, he wouldn’t know either, for he hasn’t lived that long.”
Chen Ping was stunned. He hadn’t expected that his conversation with the Red Cloud Demon Lord in his sea of consciousness would be known to the mysterious old man.
This was simply too miraculous, too formidable.
Tens of thousands of years, what an immense span of time.
“Why did your Gantian Sect, capable of creating a world in the Heavenly Realm, end up falling?”
Mo Qingyun asked the mysterious old man.
Since the Gantian Sect had become a ruin, it must have fallen long ago. Only a fallen sect would become a relic.
Chen Ping, startled by her words, quickly pulled Mo Qingyun back and said to the old man, “Senior, the young lady is ignorant, please don’t take offence.”
A being capable of creating a world in the Heavenly Realm and existing for tens of thousands of years, Chen Ping couldn’t even fathom how terrifying their strength must be.
Even if this mysterious old man was now just a spiritual form, any remnant of his power would be beyond their ability to handle.
“Hahaha, I’ve been dead for so many years, I’ve long since let go.”
The mysterious old man laughed heartily, “There are mountains beyond mountains, people beyond people. Even if my Gantian Sect could create the Third Heaven in the Heavenly Realm, so what?”
“Even this entire Heavenly Realm was created by the Supreme God. What is my Gantian Sect in comparison?”
“The cycle of the Heavenly Dao dictates that all things wither. Nothing can truly be eternal. Only the cycle of the Heavenly Dao ensures the stable development of the entire universe.”
“My Gantian Sect’s fall was decreed by the Heavenly Dao. What power do I have to defy it?”
Hearing the old man’s words, everyone’s faces turned grim.
Especially Tianci, who had always considered himself a prodigy, arrogant and dismissive of others.
But hearing the old man’s words, a deep sense of defeat welled up within him.
They were still desperately striving to break through to the Third Heaven, hoping to become revered immortals.
Little did they know, the entire Heavenly Realm was created by the Supreme God. Their struggles were likely not even a speck of dust in the grand scheme.
“Senior, we meant no offence. We came to explore the ruins, seeking opportunities.”
“Meeting you today is our great fortune. Might you offer guidance to help us improve our strength?”
Tianci shed his arrogant demeanour, adopting the posture of an eager student, respectfully addressing the mysterious old man.
“Hahaha, of course. Those who come are fated. If someone can inherit the legacy of my Gantian Sect, I’d be delighted.”
The mysterious old man laughed heartily.
“Please, Senior, guide us…”
Tianci knelt before the mysterious old man.
With a gentle wave of the old man’s hand, a flash of light passed.
Tianci and the mysterious old man vanished completely.
Only Chen Ping and a few others remained, as if the two had disappeared into thin air.
“Tianci, Tianci…”
Elder Tong from the Tianyuan Pavilion, seeing this, turned pale with fright, shouting loudly, but there was no response.
