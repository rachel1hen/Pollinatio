“Less nonsense!”
The androgynous Pavilion Master waved a hand sharply, and a black-robed cultivator shot forward like a cannonball, charging straight at Sang Tianyang!
The cultivator was a seventh-grade Loose Immortal, unleashing the supreme technique of Tianyuan Pavilion, “Abyssal Slaughter”.
Where the palm wind passed, the air twisted, carrying a devouring suction force.
“Hmph!”
Sang Tianyang let out a cold snort, standing firm. His right palm thrust forward, and a blood-red blade aura soared into the sky, the “Asura Soul-Destroying Slash”!
The blade aura collided with the palm wind, producing a deafening explosion. The black-robed cultivator screamed, his body flying back like a kite with a cut string, a massive bloody hole in his chest gushing blood, dead on the spot.
“Somewhat interesting…”
The androgynous Pavilion Master’s lips curled into a strange smile, the feminine half of their face revealing a hint of charm, “However, in our presence, your strength… is like that of an ant!”
Before the words finished, they personally attacked.
With a flicker, they appeared before Sang Tianyang, their right hand forming a claw wreathed in greenish-black corpse qi, aiming for his heart.
The speed was blinding. Sang Tianyang felt a bone-chilling cold and hurriedly raised his blade to block.
“Clang…”
The blade met the ghostly claw, emitting a metallic clang. Sang Tianyang felt an unstoppable force surge through, his arm instantly numbing as he was forced back, a trickle of blood spilling from his lips.
He stared in shock at the androgynous monster before him, “You… how did you increase your strength so quickly in such a short time?”
As an eighth-grade Loose Immortal, he had been outmatched in a single move!
“I am… the emissary of the Blood Corpse Venerable…” The androgynous Pavilion Master let out a sinister cackle, “Feel my wrath!”
The dozens of black-robed cultivators behind them launched their attacks simultaneously, various spiritual techniques raining down like a storm on the Asura Hall’s protective formation.
“Buzz…”
The blood-red protective formation trembled violently, its light flickering unstably.
Sang Tianyang’s expression grew grave. He could sense that the formation wouldn’t hold much longer under this assault.
What unnerved him more was that the androgynous monster seemed to grow stronger with each attack, its corpse qi corroding his spiritual power, making his cultivation increasingly sluggish.
“Father!”
Sang Lan, wielding the Blood-Weeping Blade, rushed to Sang Tianyang’s side, “They’re too strong! Especially that Tianyuan Pavilion Master, it’s not even him!”
“I know…”
Sang Tianyang wiped the blood from his lips, a resolute glint in his eyes, “That thing… it’s likely possessed by an ancient evil.”
“Lan’er, listen to me, go find Mr. Chen immediately!”
“Chen Ping?” Sang Lan froze.
“Yes, him!”
Sang Tianyang gritted his teeth, “Find Mr. Chen, and our Asura Hall might still be saved!”
He thrust a blood-red jade slip into Sang Lan’s hand, “This is the token to open the secret passage. Remember, you must find Chen Ping and tell him Asura Hall needs his help!”
“Father, I’m afraid even Mr. Chen isn’t a match for this monster!” Though Sang Lan knew Chen Ping was formidable, the Tianyuan Pavilion Master was clearly possessed, with strength at the peak of the Loose Immortal realm, or even beyond!
Chen Ping wouldn’t stand a chance either!
“He may not be a match, but there must be someone behind Mr. Chen. Just go, quickly!”
Sang Tianyang urged.
At that moment, the androgynous Pavilion Master attacked again, a black light beam infused with both masculine and feminine energies descending from the sky, smashing into the protective formation.
“Boom!” With a thunderous crash, the blood-red formation shattered, debris flying and dust billowing.
“Kill! Leave none alive!”
The androgynous Pavilion Master let out a frenzied roar, charging into the Asura Hall.
