“Get lost, I can only exist in your consciousness right now, no one else could withstand my remnant soul,” the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord snapped!
“Then what do we do?” Chen Ping asked helplessly!
“Forget it, I’ll go to the Celestial Realm with you. As long as you work hard and reach the Ninth Heaven soon, I can leave your consciousness and rebuild my body!”
The Crimson Cloud Demon Lord had no choice but to follow Chen Ping to the Celestial Realm!
But only upon reaching the Ninth Heaven could he leave Chen Ping’s consciousness and reconstruct his physical form!
After all, the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord was a great demon of the Ninth Heaven!
“Fine, I’ll have to trouble you for a while, Senior!” Chen Ping nodded!
After settling things with the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord, Chen Ping began cultivating like a madman!
Before him lay countless resources, all plundered from others!
He activated the Heart Condensation Technique and started cultivating furiously!
In cultivation, time loses meaning!
After who-knows-how-long, the mountain of resources in front of Chen Ping had been completely exhausted!
And his realm had soared to the Immortal Transformation Realm!
Though only at the first grade of the Immortal Transformation Realm, surviving in the First Heaven of the Celestial Realm shouldn’t be an issue!
When Chen Ping emerged from the Demon-Suppressing Tower, everyone was stunned!
“How many days did I cultivate?”
Chen Ping had no idea how long he’d been inside the tower!
“Mr. Chen, just half a month!” Lin Chong said!
“Half a month to reach the Immortal Transformation Realm? Your speed is downright heaven-defying!”
Hu Mazi exclaimed!
Chen Ping’s heart surged with wild joy. To think the Demon-Suppressing Tower was this useful—if he’d brought it to the Celestial Human Realm earlier, why had he left it with the Valley of the Wicked?
“Is the Heavenly Ladder still there?” Chen Ping asked!
“It’s still there, hasn’t budged an inch…” Lin Chong replied!
Chen Ping breathed a sigh of relief and turned to Hu Mazi, “Master Hu, I’ll take you to the Heavenly Ladder and see if we can enter the Celestial Realm. If they don’t allow it, there’s nothing I can do.”
“Don’t worry, once I’m there, I’ll check out who’s behind this Heavenly Ladder. Might be an old acquaintance!”
Hu Mazi grinned!
Since awakening his memories, Hu Mazi recalled everything from his time in the Celestial Realm, so knowing a few people was only natural!
Though they might not recognise him anymore—after all, he’d been reborn, and his appearance had long since changed!
“Chen Ping, are you just going to leave like that without saying goodbye to us?”
At some point, Ji Ruxue, leading the group of women, called out to stop him!
Looking at the women before him, Chen Ping felt his vision darken!
He’d never thought having too many women was a problem, but seeing them all together was honestly a bit overwhelming!
“Master, we can’t go to the Celestial Realm with you. If you get lonely there, what’ll you do?”
Huo Feng’s eyes brimmed with tears as she looked at Chen Ping reluctantly!
“Don’t worry, I’ve got Zhong Li. She’ll help me stave off the loneliness when the time comes!”
Chen Ping gently patted Huo Feng’s head!
“Chen Ping, when you get to the Celestial Realm, don’t go chasing skirts again. Your body can’t handle it!”
Bai Qian stepped forward, admonishing him!
Chen Ping looked at Bai Qian, a bit speechless. Most of the time, he wasn’t the one chasing—women came to him!
Take Bai Qian herself, threatening him for his bloodline and then sticking to him after.
When women threw themselves at him like that, how could Chen Ping refuse?
But at this point, he couldn’t argue, so he comforted them instead, “When I get to the Celestial Realm, I won’t mess around. I’ll miss you all.”
“You all need to cultivate hard too, strive to join me in the Celestial Realm soon!”
“If I miss you, I can come back to see you. Now that the Heaven and Earth Array is broken, the Celestial Human Realm has no restrictions. Coming back from the Celestial Realm isn’t impossible!”
After bidding farewell to the women, Chen Ping took Hu Mazi into the Heavenly Ladder!
“You’ve finally arrived…”
An old man saw Chen Ping and let out a long breath!
“Senior, thank you for waiting for me all this time. If there ever comes a day when you need me, I’ll go through hell and high water to repay you!”
Chen Ping was deeply grateful to the old man!
