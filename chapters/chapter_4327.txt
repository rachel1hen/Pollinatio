Only to see a fire suddenly pulsating in Chen Ping’s palm, but this fire was not red or blue, but white!
Seeing that Chen Ping was actually planning to attack himself with the Supreme Fire, Tan Rongkun laughed, “Even if it is the Supreme Fire, you will not be able to hurt me in the slightest.”
Chen Ping did not pay any attention to him, instead, the fire in his palm grew more and more intense!
But strangely enough, Chen Ping’s fire was rising, but the temperature around him was dropping rapidly!
It was as if the heaven and earth had frozen over, even the snowflakes that kept falling were now frozen in mid-air, not moving at all!
So everyone felt the cold and had to burst out the spiritual energy in their bodies to ward off the bitter cold!
“What’s going on here? This aura is even colder than the Yin Fiend Qi?”
Di Chongjing asked in great confusion!
Tan Rongkun also did not understand where this cold aura came from, clearly the flames on Chen Ping’s palms were pulsating, and instead of feeling a trace of heat, he instead felt an aura that was colder than the Yin Fiendish Qi!
Before Tan Rongkun could react, the flame in Chen Ping’s hand had already come out of his hand!
“Since you said that you are not afraid of flames, let’s give it a try, I hope you don’t run away in fear!”
Chen Ping taunted Tan Rongkun!
“Hmph, a mere to flame, how could I be scared away!”
Tan Rongkun snorted coldly, the red light on his body flickered as his breath continued to surge!
Chen Ping was deliberately provoking this fellow, as long as Tan Rongkun dared to come into contact with that Extreme Cold Ice Flame, he would definitely be frozen!
At that time, Chen Ping would be able to easily kill that Tan Rongkun!
Frozen flesh, there would be no way to split into thousands of blood mist!
Tan Rongkun really took the bait, his palm gathered up an aura, and then violently swung towards Chen Ping’s Extreme Cold Ice Flame!
He intended to directly stop this Supreme Flame with a palm!
But just as the Extreme Cold Ice Flame was getting closer and closer to Tan Rongkun, Tan Rongkun always felt that something was not quite right!
Because that coldness was getting thicker and thicker, underneath his feet, it was already frozen, and his feet were following the earth as it froze together!
But already at this time, Tan Rongkun in want to escape, also simply too late, can only put that extreme cold ice flame to block in front of the body!
Boom!
The aura that Tan Rongkun slapped out instantly collided with the Extreme Cold Ice Flame!
In the split second of contact, Tan Rongkun’s aura instantly condensed into ice, which could be clearly seen as a mist of ice in mid-air!
And this ice-cold aura, following Tan Rongkun’s aura, directly transmitted into his body!
Tan Rongkun’s body shivered, followed by his palms starting to freeze!
“My hands, my hands …………”
Tan Rongkun looked at his palms in surprise!
Soon, the frost spread, from his palms to his body, in to his feet, and finally his head!
Until Tan Rongkun was finally frozen, his eyes were still round, his mouth was wide open, and his eyes were filled with horror!
Amidst the incredible eyes of the crowd, Chen Ping slowly walked in front of Tan Rongkun’s body, and then gently pushed!
Boom …………
Tan Rongkun’s frozen body collapsed and then directly shattered into many pieces!
And in the instant the body shattered, a black shadow rushed out in a hurry!
This is Tan Rongkun’s divine soul, physical body this time is considered completely finished, Tan Rongkun’s divine soul intends to escape!
Looking at Tan Rongkun’s divine soul that was about to flee, Chen Ping waved his hand once again, and this time it was a ball of red fire!
The fierce flames instantly engulfed Tan Rongkun’s divine soul!
Tan Rongkun screamed miserably and soon slowly lost his voice!
Di Chongjing and those people from the Blood and Bone Sect stared blankly at the scene in front of them!
These people were dumbfounded, they never expected that Chen Ping would kill Tan Rongkun so quickly!
That was a cultivator of the second rank of the Mahayana realm!
“Escape back to the main hall ……”
Di Chongjing reacted, then swung with vigour and swept up a gust of wind!
He then led the remaining Blood and Bone Sect disciples and desperately fled towards the Blood and Bone Sect’s grand hall!
