“No problem…”
Chen Ping actually agreed on the spot!
“Chen Ping, have you lost your mind?” Lin Kefan stared at him in disbelief!
“Fourth brother-in-law, I can crush him without the Dragon-Slaying Sword…”
Chen Ping flashed a slight smile!
“Fine, since you’ve agreed, you’re not allowed to use that sword anymore,” the Tang Sect Grand Elder declared!
And just like that, Chen Ping stowed the Dragon-Slaying Sword.
Inside the tavern, the red-haired old man gaped in shock, “I can’t believe this kid actually agreed. His strength relies heavily on that precious sword.”
“Without the Dragon-Slaying Sword, beating the Tang Sect Grand Elder is impossible, that guy’s at fourth-rank Immortal Transformation Realm!”
“Not necessarily!” Young Master Ming smirked coldly, “Do you think Chen Ping’s an idiot? If he dares to agree, he’s got absolute confidence!”
“Just watch, the surprises keep piling up…”
Young Master Ming downed his wine in one gulp!
On the other side, the Tang Sect Grand Elder waved his hand grandly, “All of you, stand down, I’ll handle this myself!”
The Tang Sect disciples slowly descended back to the ground, leaving only Chen Ping and the Grand Elder facing off in midair!
But those Tang Sect lackeys kept their eyes locked on Chen Ping. Though ordered to retreat, nothing stopped them from launching a sneak attack with hidden weapons if push came to shove.
The Grand Elder stared Chen Ping down, his gaze growing icy, the butterfly dagger in his hand starting to spin.
His sudden leap to challenge Chen Ping one-on-one wasn’t selfless, he had an agenda!
Having seen Chen Ping’s sword and divine beast, the Grand Elder wanted to kill him and claim his storage ring for himself!
After that clash with the Spirit Sect, Chen Ping must’ve burned through a lot of energy!
Plus, without the Dragon-Slaying Sword, the Grand Elder was sure he could take him down!
If a group piled on and killed Chen Ping, snagging that storage ring would be a hassle.
After all, who wouldn’t drool over Chen Ping’s treasures? Someone might snatch them first.
That’s why he’d suggested a duel.
But the Grand Elder was naive, Chen Ping wouldn’t ditch the sword unless he was dead certain of victory.
“So? I’m not using the sword, can we start now?” Chen Ping asked!
“Of course, and to avoid anyone saying I’m unfair, I’ll let you have three free moves!”
The Grand Elder puffed up, sounding magnanimous!
A fourth-rank Immortal Transformation Realm cultivator against a third-rank Transcendence Realm was already lopsided, and now he’d made Chen Ping drop his weapon, how shameless could he get?
So, offering three free moves was his way of saving face in front of the crowd.
Chen Ping smirked, ignoring the taunt, and clenched his fists tight!
“Holy Light Fist…”
Chen Ping threw a punch!
Boom!
A massive iron fist tore through the void, hurtling towards the Tang Sect Grand Elder!
The Grand Elder’s eyes widened in shock. He’d assumed Chen Ping’s terrifying strength came solely from the Dragon-Slaying Sword!
But this punch carried an endless, fearsome power!
“A divine technique?” The Grand Elder’s face twisted in horror!
He could feel it in the punch’s might, this wasn’t some ordinary martial skill.
But since he’d promised Chen Ping three free moves, countering now would make him a laughingstock!
Chen Ping’s Holy Light Fist streaked like a golden meteor, ripping through the void with crushing pressure, bearing down on the Grand Elder.
Where the fist wind passed, the air seemed to split, letting out a piercing shriek.
The Grand Elder’s expression turned grave in an instant, he hadn’t expected this punch to pack such terrifying power, far beyond anything he’d anticipated.
