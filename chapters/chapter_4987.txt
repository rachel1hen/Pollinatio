Swish!
Chen Ping swung his Dragon-Slaying Sword!
The soldier’s head suddenly flew off.
As the soldier’s head rolled to Chen Ping’s feet, his eyes were wide open, his face full of disbelief, unaware of how he had died.
Aisha stared at Chen Ping in shock, she hadn’t expected someone at the first rank of the Loose Immortal Realm to possess such formidable strength.
“Today, let’s have a thorough slaughter!”
Chen Ping said, gazing at the Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand!
Mad Immortal and Bai Yi both nodded.
The sight of the dead elderly, weak, women, and children had enraged them to the core.
Though wars over resources often broke out between the three races, they were fought between armies, never involving such massacres.
This wasn’t war, it was slaughter!
It was extermination…
Chen Ping and his group pressed forward, with Aisha staying behind to protect Niu Ben’s safety!
“Who are you?”
A soldier wielding a long spear appeared, a child’s corpse still impaled on his weapon.
The moment the soldier spoke, Chen Ping’s body vanished.
Swish!
With a sky-piercing sword beam, the soldier had no time to react, his head was cleanly severed by Chen Ping.
Then several more soldiers appeared, their weapons still dripping with blood.
“Kill…”
Mad Immortal and Bai Yi roared as they charged forward.
A wave of overwhelming murderous intent swept through, and the heads of those soldiers were swiftly decapitated by Mad Immortal and Bai Yi.
Now, they killed only by beheading, perhaps this was the only way to vent their fury.
Aisha’s eyes were filled with excitement and awe!
She hadn’t expected Mad Immortal and Bai Yi to be so powerful as well.
With this, their chances of rescuing some of her people and breaking out of Flying Tiger City seemed promising.
Rumble…
At that moment, the ground trembled, followed by an overwhelming pressure bearing down on them!
A hundred soldiers, marching in perfect unison, advanced towards them!
These hundred soldiers exuded a powerful aura, their eyes bloodshot, clearly driven into a frenzy by excessive killing.
In their eyes, there was now only slaughter.
Chen Ping gripped his Dragon-Slaying Sword, flames of supreme fire igniting along its blade!
Chen Ping intended to burn these beasts to ashes.
Mad Immortal and Bai Yi also tightly gripped their weapons, their murderous intent surging.
Yet, upon seeing Chen Ping and his group, the soldiers didn’t slow their steps, continuing to approach in perfect formation!
The combined aura of the hundred soldiers created an immense suffocating pressure on Chen Ping and his group.
Chen Ping suddenly took a step forward!
With a swing of his Dragon-Slaying Sword, a colossal wave of sword intent mixed with supreme fire erupted outward.
In an instant, the entire heavenly prison became a sea of flames.
Faced with the sprawling inferno before them, the hundred soldiers finally halted.
The boundless sea of fire pressed relentlessly towards the soldiers.
The terrifying pressure from moments ago was utterly eradicated under Chen Ping’s single sword strike!
Soon, a soldier captain stepped forward, his eyes filled with confusion and disbelief.
“You’re also of the beast race, why save these humans?”
The soldier captain asked.
“No need for words, I don’t like talking to the dead…”
Chen Ping finished speaking, his body transforming into a streak of light as he charged forward!
As Chen Ping rushed in, a cascade of sword light mixed with supreme fire enveloped the hundred soldiers.
“Kill…”
The soldier captain didn’t back down, letting out a fierce roar!
The hundred soldiers charged towards Chen Ping in unison!
Seeing this, Mad Immortal and Bai Yi also rushed forward without hesitation.
Aisha desperately wanted to join in, to kill these soldiers and avenge her people.
But she had to protect Niu Ben, so she could only retreat with him, finding a safe spot.
She didn’t know if Chen Ping and the other two could handle so many soldiers.
