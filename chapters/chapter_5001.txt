“My dear son-in-law, I’m so relieved you’re alright!”
Seeing Chen Ping unharmed, Bai Yi let out a sigh of relief.
Chen Ping glanced at the battlefield, where Rhino City’s forces had suffered heavy casualties and morale was low.
“What’s this? Can’t handle Flying Tiger City?” Chen Ping asked.
Gadfly, embarrassed, said, “Flying Tiger City’s strength has surged recently, supposedly backed by the Temple. I’m no match for them.”
“Victory and defeat are common in war. Keep an eye on this guy, and I’ll handle the rest!”
Chen Ping instructed Gadfly to watch Young Master Huo.
“Big brother, they have so many men, you…” Gadfly was worried.
Though Chen Ping was powerful, the enemy had tens of thousands of soldiers, plus many elites.
Jie Zhong’s strength was formidable, especially with his demonic arts.
“Don’t worry, crushing them is like squashing ants!”
Chen Ping patted Gadfly’s shoulder.
Stepping forward, Chen Ping coldly eyed Jie Zhong, “Do you end yourself, or shall I do it?”
“Kid, a mere first-grade Loose Immortal, you’re too arrogant…”
Jie Zhong sneered, producing a black bow and arrow, ready to strike Chen Ping.
“Trash…” Chen Ping scoffed, summoning a bow of his own!
The Divine King Bow…
Chen Ping wielded the Divine King Bow, a true divine weapon, far superior to Jie Zhong’s bow!
Chen Ping drew the bow, and a radiant golden arrow appeared.
Jie Zhong and Chen Ping released their arrows simultaneously.
Whoosh…
The two arrows shot forward, colliding mid-air.
No clash, no explosion, not even a tremor in the air.
Jie Zhong’s black arrow vanished upon touching Chen Ping’s golden one, as if it never existed.
The golden arrow, undeterred, streaked toward Jie Zhong with a trail of golden light!
Boom!
The arrow pierced Jie Zhong’s body, its speed unabated!
The golden arrow tore through Flying Tiger City’s army, killing countless soldiers before dissolving into a burst of golden light.
Where it passed, a deep trench scarred the ground.
Broken limbs and bodies littered the path, with countless dead and wounded.
Jie Zhong spat blood, collapsing to his knees, eyes filled with terror.
He hadn’t expected Chen Ping’s arrow to hold such horrifying power.
Everyone else was stunned, staring at Chen Ping in shock.
Chen Ping, however, looked unfazed!
“Big brother is mighty…”
Gadfly, thrilled, raised his arm and cheered.
Rhino City’s demoralised, near-defeated army began to cheer as well!
“Mighty!”
“Mighty!”
“Mighty!”
Rhino City’s troops surged with morale, their fighting spirit reignited!
Jie Zhong struggled to his feet, black mist swirling around his chest wound, rapidly healing.
His eyes, filled with fear, fixed on Chen Ping as he gripped a token and crushed it.
He was calling for help, knowing defeat was imminent without it.
At the same moment, in a small mountain city, within the Eight Halls.
Huo Zhao, listening to the Great Elder’s report, looked grim.
His son had been kidnapped, yet the Great Elder had fled instead of rescuing him.
“Hall Master, the two who took the young master hostage, one is a Reincarnator with great strength, and the other, a young man, I couldn’t see through.”
“But I could tell the young man’s status is likely higher than the elder’s. With the young master as their hostage, I didn’t dare act and returned to report,” the Great Elder explained, covering his tracks.
“Are those two from Rhino City?” Huo Zhao asked.
