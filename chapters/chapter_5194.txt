Before he could finish speaking, his pupils suddenly contracted.
Because Chen Ping moved.
This time, Chen Ping’s speed was even faster than before!
A blur flashed by, almost beyond the limits of what the naked eye could catch. Elder Gui didn’t even have time to channel his demonic aura for protection or swing his bone staff before a searing, excruciating pain shot through his right arm.
“Ah!”
A blood-curdling scream pierced the sky, even more harrowing than the middle-aged man’s cry earlier.
Elder Gui looked down to see his right arm severed cleanly at the shoulder, dark green blood gushing out, splattering across the ground.
The bone staff that had accompanied him for years fell with a clatter, the blood-red crystal at its head flickering briefly before dimming.
“You…”
Clutching his severed arm, Elder Gui trembled in pain, his gaze towards Chen Ping filled with terror and disbelief.
He couldn’t fathom it: Chen Ping had been ten steps away, so how had he appeared before him so suddenly? And with such speed!
Chen Ping stepped on the bone staff, crushing it to dust, and looked coldly at Elder Gui: “I won’t repeat myself a third time.”
Elder Gui staggered back, retreating over a dozen steps before barely steadying himself, his eyes staring at Chen Ping as if he’d seen a ghost.
He could clearly feel the unmasked killing intent radiating from Chen Ping. If he dared utter another word, the next thing to hit the ground would be his head.
The surrounding Black Fiend Guards were utterly stunned.
Elder Gui was a figure of real power in the Council of Elders, his cultivation at the third grade of Earth Immortal, considered a top expert in the entire Black Fiend Demon Palace. Yet now… he’d had his arm severed by a human cultivator at the sixth grade of Loose Immortal?
This completely upended their understanding!
Feeling the suffocating pressure in the air and meeting Chen Ping’s icy gaze, all the Black Fiend Guards instinctively took a step back, clearing a path.
Moments ago, when Elder Gui gave his orders, they’d felt assured of victory. Now, only one thought remained: stay far away from this harbinger of doom!
If even Elder Gui was no match, wouldn’t they be courting death by stepping forward?
In an instant, the tense atmosphere turned eerie.
The circle of over a hundred Black Fiend Guards parted, forming a clear path. No one dared to advance or even meet Chen Ping’s eyes.
Youyue, watching the scene unfold, was momentarily stunned, a complex glint flashing in her eyes.
She hadn’t expected Chen Ping to suddenly strike Elder Gui, nor had she imagined his strength would be this formidable.
But regardless, the stalemate was broken.
Taking a deep breath to quell the turmoil within, she coldly swept her gaze over the silent Black Fiend Guards and the ashen-faced Elder Gui, saying in a low voice: “Get lost, now.”
Elder Gui’s lips quivered as if to speak, but no words came out.
With a venomous glare at Chen Ping, he clutched his severed arm and, supported by a few trusted aides, left the plaza in disgrace.
Seeing this, the Black Fiend Guards lowered their heads and silently retreated to the sides of the palace, not daring to make another move.
The plaza finally returned to calm, with only the corpses and bloodstains on the ground silently testifying to the earlier carnage.
Youyue walked up to Chen Ping, her purple eyes filled with complex emotions: “Thank you.”
Though she disliked his earlier mockery, she couldn’t deny that Chen Ping’s actions had saved her from a difficult situation.
If word of this incident spread, her authority as Demoness would be utterly shattered.
Chen Ping raised an eyebrow noncommittally: “I just don’t like being pestered.”
He turned to Hu Mazi, who was staring at him slack-jawed, and chuckled: “Let’s go, weren’t you going to investigate your Hu clan’s affairs?”
