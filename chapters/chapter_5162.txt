When the Dragon-Slaying Sword struck the stone figure, Chen Ping’s expression immediately changed, for he discovered that this strike had failed to pierce the stone figure.
One must know that the Dragon-Slaying Sword was a spiritual blade, capable of cutting through iron as if it were mud, let alone stone, yet now, it couldn’t even harm this stone figure.
As Chen Ping stood in shock, the stone figure’s sword suddenly thrust towards his abdomen!
Chen Ping tapped his toes on the ground, his body swiftly retreating to dodge the strike.
But the stone figure’s speed abruptly increased.
Pfft!
After Chen Ping retreated dozens of paces, he noticed a wound on his chest, though not fatal, blood was seeping out continuously.
“Damn it, what is this thing?”
Chen Ping couldn’t help but curse!
He was supposedly invincible in the Third Heaven, so why couldn’t he even handle a stone figure now?
Was this stone figure controlled by someone, or did it possess its own consciousness?
Chen Ping’s face was filled with solemnity, no longer daring to be careless. The stone figure’s speed just now was fast, if Chen Ping had been any slower, he might have been pierced through by the sword.
“Nine Shadows Sword Technique…”
Chen Ping had no choice but to use the Nine Shadows Sword Technique.
When it came to swordplay, the Nine Shadows Sword Technique was the best, as it was like having multiple helpers!
As one clone after another appeared, eight identical Chen Pings surrounded the stone figure!
Faced with all this, the stone figure remained calm, after all, it was just a stone figure, devoid of emotions, let alone fear.
As Chen Ping’s eight figures launched their attack, the stone figure suddenly changed its attack pattern.
Its swordplay became more eerie, its sword intent sharper.
Chen Ping felt as if he were submerged in a sea of swords, with the stone figure’s sword shadows coming from all directions, leaving no place to hide.
At this moment, Chen Ping was merely eight, while the stone figure seemed to fill the entire hall, its sword striking out at every moment, every second, from every place!
This left Chen Ping somewhat dazed, though he had clones, each one was struggling to cope!
“Why does this guy always manage to counter me?”
Chen Ping was utterly perplexed, even when he used the Nine Shadows Sword Technique, this stone figure could still find a way to counter it!
With no other choice, Chen Ping recalled his clones, otherwise his strength wouldn’t last long, as the clones drew their power from his main body!
“I’ll fight you to the death…”
Recalling his clones, Chen Ping let out a loud shout, a massive sword aura sweeping towards the stone figure, tearing through the air with a piercing whistle.
Sensing this powerful sword aura, the stone figure immediately swung its sword to meet it.
“Boom!”
A tremendous explosion rang out, the powerful energy wave erupting in the hall.
The shockwave sent Chen Ping flying backwards, crashing heavily to the ground.
Struggling to his feet, Chen Ping wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, his eyes filled with determination.
He charged at the stone figure again, the Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand swinging faster and faster, sword aura crisscrossing.
The stone figure showed no weakness, its sword dancing impenetrably, engaging Chen Ping in a fierce battle.
In the blink of an eye, a hundred moves passed, and Chen Ping, panting heavily, retreated!
“I’m done, can we take a break?”
Chen Ping gasped, out of breath!
After all, the strength and energy in his body couldn’t sustain him fighting endlessly!
But the stone figure wasn’t afraid, as it wasn’t a living thing and didn’t know fatigue!
Just as Chen Ping spoke, the stone figure actually stopped, standing motionless to the side.
Seeing this, Chen Ping was overjoyed, hurriedly taking out a pile of pills and stuffing them into his mouth desperately, as this was the fastest way to recover!
“Mr. Chen, are you alright?” Yun Wuya bypassed the stone figure and approached Chen Ping!
“I’m fine, this stone figure is damn weird!”
Chen Ping let out a long breath, cursing under his breath!
