The maid maintained her smile: “Sir, this is already the lowest price. Information about the Evil Path Hall is hard to come by, and we take on great risk. This price is reasonable.”
Chen Ping frowned. Although he had received one million immortal stones from Zhao Tianyi, it wasn’t a small sum, and the information’s authenticity was still uncertain.
“What if the information is false?” Chen Ping asked.
“Our information tower values its reputation and never sells false information,” the maid assured. “If the information is incorrect, we’ll refund the full amount.”
Chen Ping considered, then said: “Alright, I’ll buy it.”
He took one million immortal stones from his storage bag and handed them to the maid.
“Wait…” Ling Xue stopped Chen Ping, then turned to the maid: “We’re from the Sword Sect. Can you offer a discount?”
To Ling Xue, one million immortal stones was an astronomical figure.
Ordinary cultivators relied on immortal stones for cultivation, as other resources were scarce.
If they gave one million stones to the Sword Sect, the disciples’ strength would rise significantly.
So Ling Xue hoped for a discount to lower the cost.
“Sorry, even if the city lord came, we wouldn’t offer a discount!” the maid said with a haughty attitude.
“You…” Ling Xue’s anger flared at the maid’s tone.
“Enough, just count the stones,” Chen Ping interrupted, calming Ling Xue.
The maid took the immortal stones, verified the amount, and handed Chen Ping a slip of paper: “The Evil Path Hall’s branch is in Black Wind Valley, west of the city. It’s heavily guarded, so be careful.”
Hu Mazi was stunned: “One million for this?”
To Hu Mazi, information bought for one million stones should involve a high-ranking official, a secret room, and painstaking research, not just a scrap of paper.
“What more do you want? Should I sleep with you too? You asked for information, and I’ve given it to you,” the maid said, rolling her eyes.
“Damn…” Hu Mazi’s temper flared.
If they weren’t in Sword Saint City, if this were some wilderness, Hu Mazi would’ve made this woman taste his “steel spear.”
Chen Ping took the paper, opened it, and saw the location of Black Wind Valley written on it.
He tucked it away and said to the maid: “Thank you.”
Then he left the information tower with Hu Mazi and Ling Xue.
“Chen Ping, are we going to Black Wind Valley now?” Hu Mazi asked.
“Not yet,” Chen Ping shook his head. “Black Wind Valley is heavily guarded. Going now would be suicide. We’ll return, prepare, and scout it out tomorrow.”
“Spending one million immortal stones like that feels like such a waste!” Ling Xue still lamented the cost.
“Value doesn’t matter. They set a clear price, and we chose to buy. It’s not like they forced us,” Chen Ping said with a slight smile, taking it in stride.
“Do you want me to bring some Sword Sect disciples to join you at Black Wind Valley?” Ling Xue asked.
“No need. We’re just scouting. Too many people would be inconvenient,” Chen Ping declined.
“Alright, contact me if anything comes up!” Ling Xue said before leaving.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi returned to the inn. Chen Ping took out the paper and studied the location of Black Wind Valley carefully.
Hu Mazi, meanwhile, busied himself drawing talismans, preparing for battle.
The next morning, Chen Ping and Hu Mazi changed into inconspicuous clothing and quietly left the inn, heading toward Black Wind Valley in the west.
Black Wind Valley was five hundred miles west of Sword Saint City, where black gales blew year-round, and the valley’s eerie, terrifying atmosphere kept most people away.
After leaving the city, they planned to find Nan Batian. With Nan Batian around, they’d have nothing to fear!
