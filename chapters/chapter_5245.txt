This sword strike came swiftly and fiercely, carrying an unstoppable momentum, as if it would pierce through Chen Ping.
Hu Mazi’s face changed drastically, exclaiming, “Be careful!”
Chen Ping’s eyes narrowed, not daring to be careless. The spiritual energy in his body surged instantly, and the Dragon-Slaying Sword appeared in his hand, meeting the female cultivator’s longsword in a parry.
“Clang!”
The two swords clashed, producing a crisp sound of metal striking metal. A powerful shockwave spread outwards, causing the shop signs nearby to hum and vibrate.
Chen Ping felt an immense force transmitted through his arm, which went slightly numb, and he involuntarily took two steps back.
The female cultivator was also forced back a step, a flash of surprise in her eyes.
“Your swordsmanship…”
The female cultivator looked at the Dragon-Slaying Sword in Chen Ping’s hand and the technique of his earlier strike, her face showing disbelief, “This is… the swordsmanship of the Sword Sect?”
Chen Ping’s heart stirred. He hadn’t expected this female cultivator to recognise the Sword Sect’s swordsmanship.
He recalled that, back in the Third Heaven, he had indeed learned a few sword techniques from the ruins of the already-destroyed Sword Sect. In the heat of the moment, he had instinctively used them.
“I don’t know anything about the Sword Sect. This swordsmanship is something I figured out myself,” Chen Ping denied.
The female cultivator shook her head, her gaze sharpening, “Impossible! The essence and charm of this swordsmanship are clearly the Sword Sect’s Flowing Cloud Sword Technique.
Though you only displayed the basics, I would never mistake it. Who are you? Are you a disciple of the Sword Sect?”
Chen Ping remained silent, unwilling to admit anything. After all, the Sword Sect had already been destroyed, and he wasn’t truly a formal disciple of the sect.
Seeing Chen Ping’s silence, the female cultivator assumed he was tacitly confirming it, and her tone softened, “My name is Ling Xue, and I’m also a disciple of the Sword Sect. If you’re really from the Sword Sect, then we’re fellow disciples, and there’s no need for us to fight.”
“I’ve already said, I’m not a Sword Sect disciple.”
Chen Ping frowned, “What exactly do you want?”
“I want to know where you learned your swordsmanship.”
Ling Xue stared intently at Chen Ping, “The Sword Sect was destroyed in the Third Heaven. Apart from those of us who ascended, very few people know the Sword Sect’s swordsmanship.”
Chen Ping understood. It seemed Ling Xue was indeed a Sword Sect disciple who had ascended from the Third Heaven.
After some thought, he said, “I did learn a few sword techniques from a ruin in the Third Heaven, but I didn’t know it was the Sword Sect.”
A trace of sorrow flashed in Ling Xue’s eyes, “I see. That ruin must have been our Sword Sect’s mountain gate.
I never imagined that, after the sect’s destruction, someone would still learn our swordsmanship.”
She fell silent for a moment before looking at Chen Ping and saying, “You have a great talent for swordsmanship. Though your cultivation level isn’t high, your understanding of swordsmanship is profound.
That strike you made just now seemed simple, but it carried a charm of returning to simplicity, something even I feel inferior to.”
Chen Ping was surprised that Ling Xue would evaluate him so highly.
“Since you’ve learned our Sword Sect’s swordsmanship, you have a connection with the Sword Sect.”
Ling Xue changed the subject, “You don’t seem very familiar with Sword Saint City. I’m about to meet an elder, who’s also from the Sword Sect and is in charge of our affairs in Sword Saint City. Would you like to come with me?”
Chen Ping’s eyes flickered. He was just thinking of gathering information, and going with Ling Xue to meet the Sword Sect’s leader might yield useful details, perhaps even clues about the whereabouts of the Evil Path Hall.
“Alright.”
Chen Ping nodded in agreement, “We’ve only just arrived in Sword Saint City and were looking for someone to ask about the situation.”
Hu Mazi, listening in confusion, didn’t say much when he saw Chen Ping agree and followed the two.
As they walked through the streets of Sword Saint City, Chen Ping glanced at Ling Xue beside him and asked, “You mentioned earlier that the male cultivator you were competing with in sword intent was called Qin Feng, from the Divine Sword Manor? Is there some grudge between you two?”
