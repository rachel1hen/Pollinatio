Hu Mazi took the jade pendant with trembling hands. Tears finally burst forth uncontrollably from his eyes. “It is… it is the ancestor’s protective jade pendant…”
The three of them searched the Ten Thousand Poisons Hall for a while. They found quite a few treasures plundered by the Ten Thousand Poisons Valley back then. Most of them bore the mark of the Hu clan. Hu Mazi carefully stored these items away, as if holding rare treasures.
“Next, it is time to go to the Holy Light Sect.” Chen Ping looked out the window at the gradually dispersing poisonous mist. A trace of coldness flashed in his eyes. “None of those who participated in the siege back then will escape.”
The Holy Light Sect was located in the Holy Light Plains in the western part of the Fifth Heaven. Unlike the eerie and sinister Ten Thousand Poisons Valley, this place was enveloped year-round in golden radiance. White jade palaces floated in the clouds, resembling a fairyland.
But only a few knew how many filthy secrets were buried beneath this sacred land.
The three of them turned into three streaks of flowing light, landing outside the Holy Light Sect’s mountain gate.
The guarding disciples wore pristine white robes and held silver long swords. Upon seeing the three, they immediately stepped forward to block them. “Who goes there? Please present your invitation.”
Hu Mazi stepped forward. He said coldly, “Call your sect master out. Tell him that a descendant of the Hu clan has come to settle the blood debt.”
The guarding disciple’s face changed. “Audacious madman! How dare you spout nonsense in front of the Holy Light Sect’s gate!”
The silver long sword in his hand suddenly burst with dazzling light, thrusting towards Hu Mazi.
Chen Ping’s eyes sharpened. Without waiting for Hu Mazi to act, he flicked his finger. A strand of baleful qi turned into a black line and shot out, precisely striking the sword’s body.
With a “clang” of crisp sound, the silver long sword was shattered. Fragments scattered everywhere.
The guarding disciple retreated in shock, his face full of disbelief. “You… you are demonic heretics!”
“Demonic heretics?” Chen Ping sneered. “Compared to your Holy Light Sect, which is holy on the surface but filthy inside, we are much cleaner.”
At that moment, a majestic voice came from inside the mountain gate. “Who is causing a commotion here?”
As the voice sounded, a middle-aged man in a golden long robe walked out slowly. He had handsome features and an elegant temperament. Mild golden light emanated from his body, making him look like a saint.
“It is the Holy Light Sect’s enforcement elder, Li Xiu Yuan.” Mo Chen said in a low voice. “He has seventh-rank Earth Immortal cultivation and excels in ‘Holy Light Sword Technique’. It is said he has comprehended a trace of divine sword intent.”
Li Xiu Yuan’s gaze swept over the three. When he saw the faintly visible baleful qi around Chen Ping, his brows furrowed slightly. “You carry such heavy baleful qi and dare to trespass in my Holy Light Sect. Are you tired of living?”
“The ones tired of living are you of the Holy Light Sect.” Chen Ping stepped forward. His baleful qi erupted suddenly, dispersing a patch of the surrounding golden radiance. “Hundreds of years ago, you allied with Ten Thousand Poisons Valley and Evil Path Hall to exterminate the Hu clan. Today, it is time to settle that account.”
Li Xiu Yuan’s face changed slightly. He quickly regained composure, showing a pained expression. “Your words are mistaken! The Hu clan cultivated evil techniques back then and harmed living beings. As a righteous sect, how could the Holy Light Sect stand by? Encircling them was acting on behalf of heaven!”
“Acting on behalf of heaven?” Hu Mazi laughed in extreme anger. “My Hu clan has practised medicine for generations, healing the world. When have we ever harmed living beings? You fabricated such shameless lies just to seize our clan’s ‘Hundred Herbs Scripture’!”
“Nonsense!” A trace of ferocity flashed in Li Xiu Yuan’s eyes. “It seems you have been blinded by evil thoughts. Today, I will act on behalf of heaven and purify you demons!”
As soon as his words fell, the golden light around him surged violently. A golden long sword appeared in his hand out of thin air. The sword body was engraved with complex runes, emitting a heart-palpitating pressure.
“Holy Light Sword Technique, first form: Illuminate the Earth!”
