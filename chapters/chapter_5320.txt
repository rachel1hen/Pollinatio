At this moment a trace of fear flashed in the blood-armoured cultivator’s eyes. The Thunder Sound Temple was a great sect with a heritage of ten thousand years, its strength could not be underestimated.
Yet when he looked at the Godking Bow and the Fire Qilin within reach, greed finally overcame reason. “Then do not blame me for being rude. Disciples of the Divine Palace, heed my command, kill!”
“Kill!”
Hundreds of Divine Palace cultivators struck at the same time. Their blood-coloured shields merged into one and surged forward like a tide.
“Disciples of the Thunder Sound Temple, form the array!” Daoist Wuwei shouted in a low voice.
Dozens of Daoist priests chanted scriptures together. Golden divine light condensed into a giant palm that struck against the blood-coloured shields.
“Disciples of the Sword Sect, form the array!” Mo Chen, seeing this, also hurriedly cried out.
The Sword Sect disciples stepped on the Seven Stars, their spiritual power gathering into an enormous celestial sword that slashed toward the rushing enemies.
Li Chunfeng, Nan Batian and others also seized the chance to counterattack, and the situation in the field was instantly reversed.
Chen Ping watched the chaotic battle before him with mixed emotions.
He had never expected that in his most desperate moment so many people would make a move for his sake.
But he knew this was only the beginning.
The Godking Bow, the Dragon bloodline, the Fire Qilin, the exposure of these secrets was destined to draw him into an even greater whirlpool.
The Daoist array of the Thunder Sound Temple and the Seven Stars Sword Formation of the Sword Sect complemented each other. Golden divine light and sharp sword energy wove into a net that tore the Divine Palace’s blood-coloured shields into pieces.
The Fire Qilin rampaged unhindered, flames sweeping across the field. The black-robed evil cultivators of the Evil Path Hall were reduced to charred corpses wherever the fire passed, their screams rising one after another.
“Retreat, quickly retreat!”
An elder of a small sect, seeing the situation turn dire, was the first to lead his disciples back.
They had only been lured here by Qin Lie’s promised benefits. Now that the Divine Palace and the Evil Path Hall were at a disadvantage, how could they dare to linger in battle?
Once one fled, another followed.
The cultivators of the various sects dispersed like a receding tide, and in the blink of an eye more than half were gone.
You Wuxie, seeing his disciples fall in droves, felt a trace of fear in his eyes.
The Daoist arts of the Thunder Sound Temple were the natural nemesis of their evil cultivation. Continuing the fight would only mean complete annihilation.
“Go!”
You Wuxie made a decisive choice, taking You Yue and You Wuji with him. They turned into a streak of black smoke and fled, not even caring to take the altar.
The blood-armoured cultivator looked at the collapsing battlefield, his face dark.
He had wanted to seize the Godking Bow and the Fire Qilin, but had not expected the Thunder Sound Temple to appear.
If he did not leave now, even he might perish here.
“We are leaving!”
The blood-armoured cultivator did not even glance at Qin Lie. He led the Divine Palace disciples away as streaks of light.
They had only come because of the order of the Sixth Hall Master. Now that the mission had failed, naturally they would not sacrifice themselves for an irrelevant Qin Lie.
In the blink of an eye, the once-crowded battlefield was reduced to only Qin Lie and his son, together with a few death-sworn guards of the Divine Sword Manor.
Qin Lie looked at the empty surroundings, then at Chen Ping and his companions approaching step by step. The colour drained from his face, his eyes filled with despair.
“No, impossible!”
Qin Lie muttered. His longsword clattered to the ground. “My Divine Sword Manor, with a foundation of thousands of years, how could it fall to a mere youth like you?”
Chen Ping walked slowly to him, the blood on the Dragon-slaying Sword still fresh. “Qin Lie, you colluded with the demonic path and slaughtered your peers. Today is the day of your death.”
“Father, save me, I do not want to die!”
Qin Feng, collapsed on the ground, cried out in misery. Blood from his severed limb stained the earth red.
Qin Lie suddenly looked at Chen Ping, madness flashing in his eyes. “Chen Ping, if my son dies, I will never forgive you, even in death!”
He suddenly lunged at Chen Ping, clearly intending to die together with him.
“Stubborn fool!”
Chen Ping’s eyes turned cold, and the Dragon-slaying Sword flashed with icy light.
A spurt of blood burst forth. Qin Lie’s head rolled to the ground, his eyes wide open in deathly unwillingness.
Qin Feng stared at his father’s corpse, his body collapsing in terror. He soiled himself in fright. “Spare me, please spare my life.”
