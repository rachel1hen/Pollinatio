“Why wouldn’t I dare? Lead the way,” Chen Ping knew that since this Mad Immortal was in the Purgatory Arena, he must be far more familiar with its inner workings than Chen Ping himself.
Mad Immortal nodded, “Follow me.”
With that, Mad Immortal led Chen Ping away.
Chen Ping wasn’t worried. Now at the ninth grade of the Immortal Transformation Realm, he wouldn’t flinch even against a Scattered Immortal Realm expert.
This Mad Immortal was a Scattered Immortal Realm expert, and though Chen Ping couldn’t discern his exact grade, he had still been defeated by Chen Ping.
Moreover, Chen Ping had the Fire Qilin and the Heaven-Devouring Beast at his disposal, not to mention the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord in his consciousness.
If push came to shove, these could all serve as Chen Ping’s allies.
If the Heaven-Devouring Beast were unleashed, it would be enough to make these opponents tremble, and if Chen Ping let the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord possess him, he might very well be unmatched in the First Heaven.
Outside the Purgatory Arena, City Lord Niu Meng gazed at Chen Ping’s upright figure in the bronze mirror, his heart brimming with anticipation.
He knew this young man with the Golden Dragon Bloodline would bring tremendous changes to Rhino City, perhaps even to the entire beast clan.
He resolved that once Chen Ping emerged from the Purgatory Arena, he would make a point to befriend him and see if he could leverage his power to make Rhino City even stronger.
At this moment, Chen Ping followed Mad Immortal deeper into the Purgatory Arena.
The deeper they went, the more intense the terrifying, eerie atmosphere between heaven and earth became.
Yet along the way, they encountered no evil spirits or demonic corpses, only a noticeably thicker concentration of baleful energy around them.
Chen Ping, however, did not absorb it. No matter how dense the baleful energy of heaven and earth, it paled in comparison to the speed of absorbing it from the bodies of slain demonic corpses.
Having tasted fine grain, Chen Ping had no interest in returning to coarse chaff.
After walking a bit further, Chen Ping suddenly noticed a vast expanse of blood-red ahead.
Even the sky and earth were blood-red, causing Chen Ping’s brows to furrow involuntarily.
At the same time, a restless aura surged within his body.
Mad Immortal gazed at the area ahead, his eyes filled with emotion as he said, “Ahead lies a burial ground of countless bones and endless evil spirits. That area is sealed by a special restriction, making it different from other places.”
“Moreover, the evil spirits in that area cannot escape and are trapped within.”
“Have you been inside?” Chen Ping asked.
Mad Immortal nodded, then shook his head, leaving Chen Ping puzzled.
“Have you been inside or not? Just say it clearly,” Chen Ping asked, growing impatient.
Mad Immortal gave a wry smile and said, “My physical body couldn’t penetrate that restriction. In the end, only my divine sense entered. Fortunately, I fled right after entering, or I’d have been trapped inside as an evil spirit, and what’s left of me now would be a walking corpse.”
“How many years have you been in this Purgatory Arena?” Chen Ping asked.
“I can’t remember, probably many, many years,” Mad Immortal said after a moment’s thought.
“Do you know how this Purgatory Arena came to be? I’ve noticed all the dead here are from the demon clan, yet this place is now beast clan territory.”
Chen Ping asked, full of curiosity.
“This was originally demon clan territory, but back then, the demon clans of two major cities slaughtered each other, and all perished here.”
“It’s said that a peak Scattered Immortal demon cultivator from the Third Heaven came and resolved the conflict, then sealed this battlefield.”
“Over time, through annexation and migration, this place became beast clan territory.”
“Discovering this Purgatory Arena has brought considerable profit to Rhino City. Many beast clan cultivators from other cities pay hefty sums to come here for trials.”
