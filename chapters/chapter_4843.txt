At the same time, the entire Celestial Realm underwent a sudden upheaval.
The once-clear sky darkened abruptly, with inky clouds surging and gathering, as if poised to swallow the heavens and earth whole.
Mountains quaked, the ground split open, and jagged fissures spread in all directions like the fangs of a ferocious beast.
A howling wind roared past, carrying sand, stones, and uprooted plants, emitting a shrill, mournful wail.
Birds and beasts in the forest panicked, fleeing in all directions as if escaping some cataclysmic disaster.
“What, what’s happening?” Nan Batian’s eyes widened in shock as he stared at the earth-shaking changes, his voice trembling despite himself.
Li Chunfeng’s brows furrowed tightly, his gaze fixed gravely on the jade slip in Chen Ping’s hand, “This must be caused by that jade slip. It seems to hold some secret.”
Wuji Daoist stroked his beard lightly, a flicker of worry in his eyes, murmuring, “Such drastic changes in the heavens and earth, I fear it’s a sign that the Heaven-Earth Formation is about to emerge. Chen Ping is forcing it to reveal itself.”
“As long as the Heaven-Earth Formation appears, we can find a way to break it. Then we’ll be able to return to the Heavenly Realm, no longer trapped here.”
Hearing Wuji Daoist’s words, Nan Batian and Li Chunfeng both grew visibly excited!
Returning to the Heavenly Realm was their lifelong dream!
At that moment, Chen Ping was fully immersed in the world of the jade slip.
In the vast, boundless expanse of his divine sense, ancient and mysterious images flashed by like a carousel. He saw the birth and transformation of mountains and rivers, the orbits of stars and moons, and the rise and fall of all living beings.
Woven faintly through these scenes were threads, sometimes visible, sometimes not, the tangible manifestations of the laws of heaven and earth.
As his exploration of the jade slip deepened, Chen Ping felt his consciousness merging with the entire Celestial Realm.
He could clearly sense the breathing of every inch of land, the flow of every breeze, and the joys and sorrows of every living creature.
Deep within this world, a powerful and ancient force was slowly awakening, the power of the Heaven-Earth Formation.
“It’s close, the Heaven-Earth Formation is about to appear.”
Chen Ping muttered to himself, sweat beading on his forehead, though he was oblivious to it.
He pushed his divine sense to its limits, striving to forge a deeper connection with the soon-to-emerge Heaven-Earth Formation.
Only by doing so could he break it more quickly and easily when it finally appeared!
…
Fire Incineration Sect!
In a sealed chamber, Wen Haotian sensed the disturbances in the Celestial Realm, his expression growing even graver!
“The Heaven-Earth Formation is likely about to manifest…”
Wen Haotian murmured!
“Ancestor, whether the Heaven-Earth Formation’s emergence is good or bad, someone must be trying to break it.”
Before Wen Haotian stood an old man with a white beard, speaking up!
This was Wen Nanxing, the sect master of the Fire Incineration Sect, and father to Wen Shi and Wen Qing!
Wen Nanxing wasn’t in seclusion due to injury, he was simply healing Wen Haotian!
“There’s good and there’s bad, all things in the world are a balance of yin and yang. But if this Heaven-Earth Formation is broken, it might not be a bad thing for us!”
Wen Haotian said, glancing at a bronze coffin nearby!
“Ancestor, who’s in that bronze coffin? Why do you infuse it with spiritual energy every day?”
Wen Nanxing asked, puzzled!
At those words, Wen Haotian’s face darkened instantly, his cold gaze fixing on Wen Nanxing, “How many times have I told you? Don’t ask about things you shouldn’t, and don’t know things you’re not meant to. It does you no good!”
Feeling the chill radiating from Wen Haotian, Wen Nanxing shuddered in fright, “Ancestor, I was wrong, I won’t ask again!”
“The day the Heaven-Earth Formation is broken, I wonder if he’ll awaken?”
Wen Haotian stared blankly at the bronze coffin!
