Her massive palm, large as a fan, swept toward Chen Ping’s face with a foul gust, its move simple and direct, yet brimming with force capable of crushing metal and stone.
“Courting death!”
A cold glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes as he unleashed his spiritual energy without reserve, his seventh-rank Loose Immortal aura surging abruptly.
He knew the gap in their realms was vast, but with no way to retreat, he could only fight to the death!
The Dragon-Slaying Sword struck, a dazzling sword light slicing through like a meteor piercing the night, meeting Fat Lady’s giant palm head-on.
This strike condensed his entire essence, spirit, and will, its sword momentum fierce, carrying an unyielding resolve.
“An ant trying to shake a tree!” Fat Lady’s lips curled in disdain, her fan-like palm not dodging, instead slamming straight toward the sword light.
“Boom!”
The clash of sword and palm unleashed a deafening roar.
A wild surge of energy radiated from the two, causing the onlookers’ faces to pale as they hurriedly summoned their spiritual energy to resist. Those with weaker cultivation were forced back, their faces filled with shock.
Chen Ping felt an overwhelming force surge through the sword, numbing his arm instantly, his grip splitting open, blood streaming down.
He was flung back as if struck by a charging beast, stumbling dozens of steps before barely steadying himself, a metallic taste rising in his throat, blood nearly spilling out but forcibly swallowed.
“Just this much skill?”
Fat Lady sneered, her assault unrelenting. In a flash, she closed in on Chen Ping again, her other palm sweeping with a howling gust, aiming to crush him with a single blow.
The surrounding cultivators gasped:
“He’s done for, this young man’s finished!”
“How can a Loose Immortal withstand the seventh rank of the Earth Immortal realm?”
“Such a pity, he’s got guts, but the strength gap is too wide.”
Hu Mazi’s eyes blazed with desperation, wanting to help but blocked by several Information Building guards, forced to watch helplessly as Fat Lady’s massive palm neared Chen Ping, roaring in fury.
At this critical moment, a spark of madness flickered in Chen Ping’s eyes. Instead of retreating, he advanced, twisting his body to avoid vital points while his Dragon-Slaying Sword darted out like a snake, stabbing at Fat Lady’s armpit at an impossible angle.
This strike was cunning to the extreme, risking her blow to land one of his own!
Fat Lady hadn’t expected such ferocity from Chen Ping. A hint of surprise flashed in her eyes, but it was too late to block, forcing her to twist her body.
“Rip!”
The sword light flashed, missing her vitals but carving a deep gash in her arm, blood gushing out instantly.
“Courting death!”
Fat Lady was enraged. A mere seventh-rank Loose Immortal not only withstood two of her moves but injured her, an utter humiliation!
She roared, her attacks growing more ferocious, palm shadows weaving through the air, sealing off all of Chen Ping’s escape routes, each strike carrying earth-shattering might.
Chen Ping gritted his teeth, relying on deft footwork and indomitable will to barely hold on under her storm-like onslaught.
New wounds appeared on his body, blood soaking his clothes, leaving him battered, yet his eyes grew brighter, radiating an unyielding, never-surrendering light.
“Clang! Clang! Clang!”
The sound of clashing weapons rang out ceaselessly. Each collision sent Chen Ping’s blood churning, his injuries worsening, yet he always found a sliver of hope in the direst moments, stubbornly enduring.
One, two, three… ten moves!
Chen Ping had survived ten moves under Fat Lady’s hands!
This outcome stunned everyone, including the Information Building’s guards.
No one had imagined a seventh-rank Loose Immortal could last so long against the seventh-rank Earth Immortal master of the building, defying all their expectations!
