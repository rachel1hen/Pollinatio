Since when could demonic cultivators enter the Purgatory Arena of the beast clan’s territory?
Could it be that in the centuries I’ve been away, the outside world has undergone earth-shattering changes?
While pondering, the Mad Immortal hurriedly threw a punch!
Boom!
The deafening clash of fist and sword echoed through the Purgatory Arena.
Shockwaves surged outward like a raging tide, tearing the ground into jagged ravines, sending shattered stones flying and dust swirling.
The battle between Chen Ping and the Mad Immortal had reached a fever pitch. Initially, they traded blows evenly, locked in a fierce stalemate.
The Mad Immortal, with his profound Loose Immortal Realm cultivation and vast combat experience, imbued each punch with earth-shattering force.
His fist winds roared, as if tearing space itself apart.
Yet Chen Ping, at the Ninth Grade of Immortal Transformation Realm, relied on the mysterious, ferocious power within him and the razor-sharp Dragon-Slaying Sword to withstand the Mad Immortal’s relentless assault.
In Chen Ping’s hands, the Dragon-Slaying Sword danced like a lively dragon, its shadows flickering. Each swing unleashed piercing sword aura, clashing fiercely with the Mad Immortal’s fist energy.
Sword auras crisscrossed, carving radiant arcs through the air, illuminating the surrounding darkness as if it were daylight.
The longer they fought, the more shocked the Mad Immortal became. He never imagined this Immortal Transformation Realm cultivator could possess such tenacious combat prowess and chilling strength.
He had assumed he could easily suppress Chen Ping, but as the battle wore on, he realized Chen Ping showed no signs of retreat, instead growing fiercer with each exchange.
Each sword strike carried an unstoppable momentum, as if intent on cleaving him down entirely.
As time passed, Chen Ping began to grasp the Mad Immortal’s attack patterns, shifting from defence to offence.
His figure darted like lightning, weaving through the Mad Immortal’s fist shadows with ease, the Dragon-Slaying Sword slashing relentlessly, unleashing torrents of sharp sword aura like a storm upon the Mad Immortal.
The Mad Immortal felt the pressure mount, scrambling to parry Chen Ping’s attacks, sweat beading on his forehead.
Each clash with the Dragon-Slaying Sword left his arms numb, his blood and energy churning within.
“Damn it, how is this kid so troublesome!” the Mad Immortal cursed inwardly, searching for a flaw in Chen Ping’s assault to land a decisive blow.
But Chen Ping’s attacks were too relentless, leaving him no room to counter.
Seizing an opportunity, Chen Ping roared, the long-suppressed power within him erupting like a volcano.
His eyes gleamed with madness, the Dragon-Slaying Sword blazing with light.
A massive golden sword aura shot skyward, carrying world-destroying momentum, slashing fiercely towards the Mad Immortal.
The Mad Immortal’s face paled, sensing the terrifying power of this strike. He hurriedly channelled his full cultivation, forming a thick immortal energy shield before him.
Yet, against Chen Ping’s all-out attack, the spiritual shield was pitifully fragile.
The golden sword aura sliced through the shield like a blade, striking the Mad Immortal with devastating force.
“Boom!”
With a thunderous crash, the Mad Immortal’s body was hurled back like a cannonball, crashing heavily into the ground.
The impact cratered the earth, dust and smoke billowing.
Struggling to rise, the Mad Immortal realized his body was gravely wounded, his organs feeling as if they had been shattered, wracked with unbearable pain.
He looked up at Chen Ping, approaching step by step, his eyes filled with shock and unwillingness.
Outside the Purgatory Arena, City Lord Niu Meng, observing through the bronze mirror, was struck speechless with astonishment.
His eyes widened, his mouth agape, as if he could fit an egg inside.
He never imagined that Chen Ping, a mere Immortal Transformation Realm cultivator, could defeat the Loose Immortal Realm Mad Immortal.
