Standing nearby, Nan Batian watched as powerhouses like Lin Chong and Wuji Daoist treated Chen Ping with utmost respect, feeling a surge of gratitude, it seemed he hadn’t followed the wrong person!
“Chen Ping, what’s going on? How did we all get sent out?”
Lin Keting asked Chen Ping!
“The guardian of the first tier was brought out by me, so naturally, everyone inside had to be sent out too.”
Chen Ping explained!
“Mr. Chen, are you referring to this man?”
Lin Chong glanced at Nan Batian!
Wuji Daoist also eyed Nan Batian, frowning in confusion, “A Heavenly Realm cultivator?”
Chen Ping nodded, “His name’s Nan Batian, a Heavenly Realm cultivator, he committed a minor offense and was imprisoned in the first tier of the Heavenly Ladder as a guardian.”
“I broke the prisoner’s mark in his body, so I brought him out…”
“Broke the prisoner’s mark?” Wuji Daoist was startled, “Breaking a prisoner’s mark at will triggers divine retribution, if the one who set it is a powerful figure, the Power of the Heavenly Dao can be terrifying!”
As a Heavenly Realm cultivator himself, Wuji Daoist was well aware of this!
“Not that strong, just a minor Golden Immortal, the Heavenly Dao power was weak…”
Chen Ping said casually!
“What? A minor Golden Immortal?”
Everyone stared at Chen Ping, dumbfounded!
Since when did a Golden Immortal mean nothing in Chen Ping’s eyes?
Not far off, Ning Zhi, hearing this, felt like slamming his head into a wall and ending it all!
“Mr. Chen is indeed formidable, my prisoner’s mark was branded by a Golden Immortal, yet Mr. Chen broke it effortlessly and even withstood that divine retribution!”
Nan Batian’s words confirmed Chen Ping wasn’t just bragging!
For a moment, no one spoke, unsure of what to say!
By now, some had already started heading for the second tier, while others crowded around Chen Ping, bowing and scraping, “Mr. Chen, are you going to the second tier too? If you do, could you tame the guardian there as well, so we can benefit too?”
If Chen Ping tamed the second tier’s guardian, everyone who entered would also receive a clearance mark!
“Of course I’m going, the Heavenly Ladder has nine tiers, which means nine guardians, I’m going to tame them all!”
Chen Ping said, gazing up at the towering Heavenly Ladder piercing the clouds!
Though everyone knew Chen Ping was boasting, many still buzzed with excitement!
If they stuck behind Chen Ping, could they also climb all nine tiers and ascend to the Heavenly Realm?
“I’m going to the second tier too!”
Lin Keting grew excited as well!
Since Chen Ping was so powerful, following him should keep her safe!
“Ting’er, don’t be reckless, just because you faced no danger on the first tier doesn’t mean the second will be safe too.”
Lin Chong shouted at Lin Keting!
“No way, I’m going!” Lin Keting grabbed Chen Ping’s arm!
Chen Ping, seeing this, gave a helpless smile, “Let her come along, with me here, anything below the fourth tier shouldn’t pose a danger.”
“I’ll protect Mr. Chen too!”
Nan Batian quickly chimed in to show his loyalty!
Though he couldn’t challenge the second tier’s guardian, he could handle the cultivators in that world!
Seeing this, Lin Chong finally nodded, agreeing to let Lin Keting enter the second tier!
Chen Ping took Lin Keting’s hand, with Nan Batian close behind, and the three leaped toward the second tier’s stone steps!
“Junior Brother, what do we do? Follow him and wait for an easy pass?”
Su Yuqi asked Ning Zhi!
Ning Zhi’s face was green with frustration by now, but he could only sigh helplessly, “We’ve got no choice, I’d like to see how far this Chen Ping can climb…”
With that, Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi leaped up, heading for the second tier’s stone steps!
