Hong Yao’s eyes flickered as she mused thoughtfully, “That’s true, isn’t it? Why doesn’t the Huo family take action themselves?”
“Because the Huo family knows it’s not that easy to kill me. I’ve got someone backing me, someone they don’t dare offend. That’s why they’ve put out a bounty and let others do the dirty work,” Chen Ping explained.
“You’ve got someone behind you? Could it be that your backer is even stronger than the Huo family?” Lan Yao asked.
A smirk tugged at Chen Ping’s lips, “A measly Huo family? I could wipe them out with a wave of my hand…”
“Bragging nonsense! Why don’t I believe you’ve got anyone backing you? Go on then, tell us, who’s your so-called support?” Lan Yao retorted sceptically. She didn’t buy it, a mere third-grade Mahayana cultivator having some powerful backer? Unlikely!
“My backer is myself!” Chen Ping pointed at himself and said.
“You dare mess with us sisters, I…” Lan Yao, convinced Chen Ping was toying with them, raised her hand to strike him down.
But just as she moved, a terrifying pressure descended upon them!
“Let’s see how you escape now!” Tang Xiaoyi roared, charging in with fury. He threw a punch at Chen Ping and the two sisters, his ninth-grade peak Mahayana power infusing the strike with an aura of utter devastation.
Hong Yao and Lan Yao paled in shock. It was too late to flee now!
Despair washed over their faces, they knew they were doomed today!
Pfft!
Suddenly, Tang Xiaoyi froze mid-motion, then plummeted from the sky!
His wide eyes stared in disbelief at his chest, where a sword had somehow pierced through him!
The Dragon-Slaying Sword…
The sisters were dumbfounded. They hadn’t even seen how the sword had struck!
Tang Xiaoyi’s two attendants behind him erupted with menacing auras, positioning themselves protectively at his sides.
Both were first-grade Transcendent Immortals, and seeing their young master impaled, their brows furrowed tightly.
With their strength, they hadn’t even noticed how the sword had pierced their young master’s body!
“Friend Chen, we’re from the Tang Sect. This is our young master. We hope you’ll spare him!” one of the cultivators said, cupping his fists toward Chen Ping.
To stab Tang Xiaoyi through the chest in an instant, right under their noses, Chen Ping’s strength couldn’t possibly be just third-grade Mahayana as it appeared!
Not to mention, Tang Xiaoyi was at the peak of ninth-grade Mahayana, how could a third-grade cultivator possibly impale him with one strike?
The only explanation was that Chen Ping was hiding his true power!
“The Tang Sect?” Chen Ping shook his head, “Never heard of it.”
Swish!
The Dragon-Slaying Sword returned to Chen Ping’s hand, and in that instant, Tang Xiaoyi’s body split in two, his form and spirit utterly destroyed!
At the same time, Tang Xiaoyi’s storage pouch flew into Chen Ping’s grasp.
“Truly a rich young master, plenty of good stuff in here!” Chen Ping glanced at the pouch before turning to the two Tang Sect cultivators, “Feel free to avenge your young master…”
The two exchanged a glance but didn’t dare make a move.
The more nonchalant Chen Ping acted, the more uneasy they felt!
They could only glare at him, hands clenched, exuding a fearsome aura, but they held back.
That single sword strike had left them shaken!
They were Transcendent Immortal experts, yet they hadn’t even seen how Chen Ping had attacked!
They’d assumed that even if Tang Xiaoyi wasn’t Chen Ping’s match, he wouldn’t be instantly killed.
If things went south, they’d planned to step in and help.
But who could’ve predicted Tang Xiaoyi would be taken out in a flash?
Now they understood why the Huo family had offered 200,000 immortal spirit stones as a bounty to kill Chen Ping!
Strength like this was worth every penny of that 200,000!
After staring Chen Ping down for a moment, the two Tang Sect cultivators slowly let their auras dissipate. Then, each grabbed half of Tang Xiaoyi’s corpse and swiftly vanished into the horizon!
