“They’re likely not from Rhino City. One of them is clearly human, probably connected to Cangxuan Continent. After all, Flying Tiger City recently plundered resources and enslaved many from Cangxuan Continent.”
“This time, it seems Cangxuan Continent sent people to rescue their own, coinciding with Rhino City’s attack on Flying Tiger City, when its defences were weak.”
“I checked, and those human slaves were freed. Young Master Huo happened to be out at the time and was captured by them,” the Great Elder said, omitting any mention of Niu Ben.
“It seems Cangxuan Continent still has skilled fighters, even managing to recruit a Reincarnator,” Huo Zhao’s eyes glinted. “No matter how many experts they have, if they dare touch my son, I’ll wipe out their entire continent.”
Huo Zhao radiated killing intent, while Cangxuan Continent, unaware, was about to face the Temple’s wrath.
At that moment, a red light flashed in the hall. Huo Zhao frowned, “Jie Zhong’s in danger. What a useless fool, can’t even handle Rhino City, yet he dreams of dominating the Beast Clan.”
Huo Zhao glanced at a black-clad figure beside him, “Go to the border and assist Jie Zhong!”
“Yes, sir!” The black-clad figure nodded and vanished instantly.
At the border, Chen Ping watched Jie Zhong’s body rapidly heal but made no move to attack.
“Well? If you end yourself, you can keep a whole corpse. Or, you could surrender now and merge Flying Tiger City into Rhino City,” Chen Ping said to Jie Zhong.
“Dream on!” Jie Zhong glared, “I’ve already called for help, and they’re almost here!”
Whoosh!
As Jie Zhong spoke, a blur shot from the horizon.
A black-clad man, wielding a dark dagger, landed beside Jie Zhong.
“The Hall Master says you’re useless and sent me to help.”
“Who do I kill?” the black-clad man said coldly to Jie Zhong.
Though Jie Zhong bristled at the insult, he swallowed his pride.
“Kill him…” Jie Zhong pointed at Chen Ping.
The black-clad man glanced at Chen Ping and moved to strike without a word.
Chen Ping sneered, ready to act, but Hu Mazi stepped in front of him.
“Leave this small fry to me!”
Hu Mazi threw a punch!
Boom!
The black-clad man was forced back, and Hu Mazi smirked, vanishing from the spot.
The black-clad man frowned as Hu Mazi charged. His body began to blur, splitting into multiple afterimages that attacked Hu Mazi from all directions.
Seeing this, Hu Mazi’s eyes narrowed. He muttered incantations, and yellow talismans appeared!
The talismans orbited Hu Mazi, and the surrounding space trembled as a powerful force surged outward from him.
The talismans, as if guided, chased the afterimages.
The black-clad man, alarmed, retreated, but it was too late!
A talisman stuck to him!
Bang!
With a loud explosion, the black-clad man was blown apart!
Blood splattered everywhere.
Jie Zhong was dumbfounded.
What just happened?
The Eight Halls’ reinforcement was killed so easily?
“Master Hu, at your age, maybe ease up on showing off…” Chen Ping teased, seeing Hu Mazi’s flair.
“I can’t outshow you. The rest is yours!” Hu Mazi laughed.
The two chatted and laughed, completely dismissing Flying Tiger City’s tens of thousands of troops.
Jie Zhong knew he could only rely on numbers now!
“Kill them…” Jie Zhong roared!
Flying Tiger City’s soldiers bellowed and charged at Chen Ping!
