Soul Demon Sect!
Ochre Yan followed Jiang Yulian and had become dual-cultivation partners, and most of the things in the entire Soul Demon Sect were being taken care of by Ochre Yan and Jiang Yulian!
On the other hand, Patriarch Jiang was in a rare moment of leisure and spent the whole day in closed-door cultivation!
“Eldest Miss, there are a few cultivators outside, wanting to request to see Sovereign.”
A Soul Demon Sect disciple, walked into the main hall and said to Jiang Yulian!
“Here to reshape their flesh again, right, let them in!”
Jiang Yulian said!
The Soul Demon Sect was famous for reshaping their flesh, so many sects and families, if they had disciples whose flesh was destroyed, then they would bring their remnant souls and reshape their flesh!
Soon, a red-haired old man, with a few disciples walked in!
Ochre Amazing only took one look and knew that these people were not here to remould their physical bodies, as these people did not have residual souls with them!
Ochre Yan himself had become a remnant soul for so long, so he could tell at a glance if there was a remnant soul present on the other person!
Jiang Yulian also frowned and opened her mouth to ask, “Fellow Daoists, I wonder if you could be here to remould your flesh?”
“Eldest niece, it seems like you don’t remember me, and it’s no wonder, it seems like you were still cradled in my arms when I left!”
That red-haired old man spoke to Jiang Yulian!
When Jiang Yulian heard this, she was filled with doubt, “You are …………”
“My name is Di Chong Jing, your father’s senior brother ah, back then, your father and I worshipped together.”
“I wonder if your father has mentioned me to you?”
Di Chong Jing asked with a smile!
When Jiang Yulian heard this, her face instantly turned ugly, but she quickly recovered and then shook her head, “I’m really sorry, my father didn’t mention it to me.”
“But since you are my father’s senior brother, then please rest for the time being, my father is closed, allow me to call my father up and catch up with Uncle Di after!”
“Hahaha, I didn’t realise that senior brother is still so hardworking after so many years, I’ll wait for him then!”
Di Chongjing laughed!
“Take Uncle Di to rest, make sure you entertain him well!”Jiang Yulian ordered towards a Soul Demon Sect disciple!
Di Chongjing and the others were taken down to rest, while Jiang Yulian sank into a chair with a plop after seeing Di Chongjing leave!
At this moment, Jiang Yulian was sweating profusely, and there was still panic in her eyes!
“Yulian, what’s going on?”
Seeing this, Ochre Yan rushed forward and asked!
“That person just now, turned out to be father’s senior brother, my father mentioned this senior brother to me.”
“This senior brother of his is very cruel, cultivating with human bones, it seems like he even created some kind of Blood and Bone Sect, sucking human blood and gnawing on human bones.”
“My father, on the other hand, used what he learnt and built the Soul Demon Sect, so that apart from being able to help people, he could also earn some resources himself.”
“Because the two have different philosophies, that’s why my father never interacted with this senior brother, I didn’t expect him to find his way to the family’s door.”
“I don’t know what he to has in mind, at this time of the year when father is in seclusion, we are afraid that we won’t be able to cope!”
Jiang Yulian explained in detail following Ochre Yan!
When Ochre Yan heard this, he was also startled!
Just now, that Di Chong Jing could tell at a glance that it was a Mahayana realm expert, this kind of expert, it would be hard for their Soul Demon Sect to deal with!
Even if Patriarch Jiang were to come out of the gate, together with the many disciples of the Soul Demon Sect, it wouldn’t be a simple matter to defeat these few cultivators of Di Chong Jing!
“It’s better to wake father up first, we can’t have him in seclusion, at that time, if the Soul Demon Sect is gone, father, his seclusion will be useless.”
Ochre Yan also thought about waking up Patriarch Jiang first and discussing a plan!
Ochre Yan followed Jiang Yulian who had already become a dual cultivation mate, so the name calling changed with him!
“Alright, let’s go wake father up and see what he has in mind.”
Jiang Yulian followed Ochre Yan to the place where Patriarch Jiang was cultivating!
