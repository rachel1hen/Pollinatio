Resolving the two Nether Elders took only a few breaths. Chen Ping’s scarlet gaze turned towards the Yin Division Shadow Guards still entangled with the Qingyun Sect disciples.
These Shadow Guards were already restrained by the Qingyun Sect members. Seeing the two elders meet their demise, their morale collapsed, and their movements became sluggish.
“Scum, die!”
Chen Ping leapt into the air, his Dragon-Slaying Sword dancing wildly, transforming into a sky full of demonic flame sword rain, sweeping the battlefield like a plough through a courtyard.
The Shadow Guards’ poison blades and agility were meaningless before absolute power. Where the demonic flame sword rain passed, black shadows fell in droves, burned to charcoal before they could even scream.
Occasional stragglers attempting a sneak attack were obliterated by a casual demonic energy blast from Chen Ping.
Hu Mazi, Huo Jingjing, and the others stood dumbfounded, watching the figure cloaked in crimson demonic flames move through the enemy ranks as if no one was there. Corpses littered the ground in his wake, an indescribable shock rising in their hearts.
The formidable enemies that had just left them helpless were now like clay chickens and pottery dogs under this demonic might.
The Seventh Hall Master, in particular, stared at Chen Ping in horror. If Chen Ping had been like this earlier, he wouldn’t have lasted a single move!
“Cough… cough…”
Moments later, the last Shadow Guard was consumed by the demonic flames. Chen Ping’s body suddenly convulsed with violent coughs, his mouth no longer spilling black blood but a crimson liquid tinged with demonic energy.
The demonic flames on his body began to flicker unstably, and a trace of clarity struggled to emerge in his scarlet pupils.
“Senior, you’ve gone a bit overboard. This kind of power outburst is more than I can handle!”
Chen Ping said to the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord with exasperation.
“I got a bit carried away showing off, my apologies!”
As the words fell, the crimson demonic flames in Chen Ping’s eyes rapidly faded. His body swayed, nearly collapsing, but Huo Jingjing rushed forward to support him.
His face was pale as paper, and though the wound on his chest no longer festered, it faintly emitted black energy. Clearly, the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord’s power had taken a toll on his body.
“Chen Ping! Are you alright?”
Huo Jingjing asked anxiously.
Chen Ping waved a hand, surveying the scorched corpses and the dissipating Nether energy. Feeling the surging demonic and spiritual energy within him, a complex glint flashed in his eyes.
He looked towards the northwest, where a patch of inky clouds had yet to fully disperse, and said in a low voice, “No matter what organisation they are, this debt is only just beginning.”
Amid the ruins, the stench of blood and charred flesh mingled. The Qingyun Sect disciples, survivors of the ordeal, looked at Chen Ping with a mix of awe and lingering fear.
The Seventh Hall Master stumbled over, looking at the injured Chen Ping in shock. “Chen Ping, were you… possessed just now?”
Chen Ping nodded honestly. “A friend’s soul, I let him borrow my body for a bit.”
“Your friend, he…”
“Ninth Heaven…”
“Hiss…” The Seventh Hall Master gasped sharply.
Ninth Heaven! No wonder a mere wisp of a soul, borrowing a body, could be so formidable.
“I’ll report your information to the Fourth Hall Master as it is. I’ll also do my best to persuade the temple not to oppose you.”
“But my influence is limited, and whether it’ll have any effect depends on the decision-makers in the Divine King Palace.”
“I’ll make it clear, though, stating the stakes and that you have friends in the Ninth Heaven.”
The Seventh Hall Master was now trying to curry favour with Chen Ping!
A friend in the Ninth Heaven, that alone made him invincible in the Third Heaven!
“Thank you!” Chen Ping nodded towards the Seventh Hall Master.
“No need, no need. We’ve fought and come to know each other. I have some resources here, so feel free to recover at my place!”
The Seventh Hall Master was exceedingly courteous, eager to befriend Chen Ping and avoid offending him.
