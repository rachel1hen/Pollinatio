He stood still, feeling the surging power within his body, his heart filled with joy.
He knew that in his battle with the stone man, he had achieved a tremendous breakthrough.
His sword intent had reached a new height.
As the battle continued, Chen Ping’s understanding of sword intent grew increasingly profound.
He discovered that sword intent was not merely a force, but a comprehension of heaven, earth, nature, and life itself.
The stone man’s sword techniques, through various moves, demonstrated this very comprehension.
During an intense clash, Chen Ping’s Dragon-Slaying Sword suddenly let out a clear hum, its blade radiating brilliant light.
This was the first time such a strange phenomenon had occurred since the Dragon-Slaying Sword had acknowledged him as its master.
Chen Ping knew this was because his sword intent had advanced, and the power of the Dragon-Slaying Sword had risen accordingly.
At this moment, Chen Ping no longer viewed the battle with the stone man as a life-or-death struggle, but as a rare opportunity for cultivation.
In the midst of battle, he continuously pushed beyond his limits, gaining insights into higher levels of sword intent.
His sword techniques, through this constant realization, underwent earth-shattering changes.
Yun Wuya stood to the side, watching the fierce battle between Chen Ping and the stone man, his heart filled with shock.
He had never seen anyone who could, in such a dangerous battle, continually break through their limits and comprehend sword intent.
He knew that the Chen Ping before him would surely become an extraordinary figure in the future.
As time passed, Chen Ping’s sword intent reached a terrifying realm.
His sword seemed to have merged with heaven and earth, each swing causing the space around it to tremble.
Though the stone man’s sword techniques remained formidable, they were no longer as insurmountable as before in the face of Chen Ping.
In one battle, Chen Ping unleashed a sword technique that fused all his insights.
This move, like a dazzling river of stars, swept toward the stone man. The stone man swung its sword with all its might to defend, but in the end, it was struck by Chen Ping’s technique.
Under this blow, cracks began to appear on the stone man’s body.
However, just as Chen Ping thought the stone man was about to be destroyed, a dazzling light suddenly emanated from its body.
When the light dissipated, the stone man’s sword flew toward Chen Ping and landed in front of him.
Chen Ping looked at the sword, his heart filled with confusion.
As he reached out to grasp it, a vast surge of sword intent flooded into his mind.
He understood: this stone man was, in fact, a sword spirit guarding this place, existing to test those who entered and guide them to comprehend higher levels of sword intent.
At this moment, Chen Ping’s heart was filled with gratitude.
He bowed deeply to the stone man, “Thank you, senior, for your guidance. Chen Ping has benefited immensely.”
With that, he picked up the stone man’s sword, which resonated with his Dragon-Slaying Sword.
The stone light in the hall gradually faded, and the stone man dissolved into specks of glowing embers, merging into the ancient sword before Chen Ping.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword trembled lightly, and an ancient, rustic sword pattern faintly appeared on its blade, shimmering with a ghostly light as if alive.
Holding both swords, Chen Ping felt a majestic sword intent coursing through his limbs and body, washing away the exhaustion from his earlier battle with the stone man.
“Mr. Chen, your sword intent…”
Yun Wuya, standing nearby, had eyes full of astonishment.
He could clearly sense that the Chen Ping before him seemed to have merged with the laws of the sword path between heaven and earth, every movement carrying an ineffable, mysterious rhythm.
“This stone man was a sword spirit guarding the sword intent. By some stroke of luck, I’ve gained a great opportunity.”
Chen Ping gently stroked the Dragon-Slaying Sword, its clear and lingering hum resonating, “Let’s go. We’ve delayed so long, I don’t know how Hu Mazi and the others are faring.”
As Chen Ping and the others prepared to leave, they suddenly noticed that the stone wall was covered with ancient sword technique diagrams.
