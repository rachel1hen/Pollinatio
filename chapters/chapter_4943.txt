Chen Ping was unleashing his full potential without any restraint, wielding the Dragon-Slaying Sword, continuously absorbing the surrounding malevolent yin energy.
This place was truly a paradise for Chen Ping!
However, just as Chen Ping thought the purgatory arena only contained those evil spirits and that single demonic corpse, he suddenly felt the ground tremble and shake.
Immediately after, he saw the ground not far away split open, and then thousands of demonic corpses slowly crawled out from the crevice.
“Bloody hell…”
Chen Ping’s brows furrowed slightly. Dealing with just one demonic corpse had been somewhat challenging, and now so many had appeared.
But knowing these demonic corpses feared the ultimate fire, Chen Ping wasn’t overly panicked!
He could use these demonic corpses as resources for his cultivation.
Holding the Dragon-Slaying Sword, flames rose from the blade, and he charged towards the demonic corpses.
At that moment, Gadfly, who was observing Chen Ping’s every move, said in disbelief, “This guy, is he mad? Taking on so many demonic corpses alone?”
“Father…”
Just then, Niu Li suddenly burst into the city lord’s room, seemingly looking for him.
Gadfly was startled and hurriedly covered the bronze mirror that displayed the purgatory arena.
But Niu Li had already caught a glimpse. Though the image in the mirror flashed by briefly, she was still shocked.
“Eh, how is it him?”
Niu Li was astonished to see Chen Ping in the mirror.
“What did you say?” Gadfly asked.
“Father, why is there an image of a person in this bronze mirror?”
Niu Li stepped forward, directly pulling off the cloth covering the mirror.
“Oh, this is a scene from the purgatory arena. Someone is undergoing a trial there, and I was just watching,” Gadfly explained, then looked at Niu Li and asked, “From what you just said, do you know this person in the trial?”
“Ah, no, I don’t know him…”
Niu Li quickly shook her head, denying it. She didn’t dare admit she knew Chen Ping.
After all, she had given Chen Ping a token and later lost contact with him. If her father found out, it would be trouble.
“What did you come to me for?” Gadfly asked.
“Father, I want to go out and have some fun on the streets. I’ve been stuck in the mansion for so long, I’m going stir-crazy,” Niu Li said.
“No, the city isn’t safe right now. You’d better stay in the mansion…”
Gadfly immediately refused.
The spies from Flying Tiger City in the city hadn’t been identified yet, and it would be dangerous for Niu Li to wander around.
Seeing this, Niu Li rolled her eyes in frustration and left.
Meanwhile, in the purgatory arena, Chen Ping, holding the Dragon-Slaying Sword, was surrounded by roaring flames as he charged into the horde of demonic corpses!
The Dragon-Slaying Sword, wrapped in blazing flames, streaked across the gloomy sky of the purgatory arena like a meteor.
The moment Chen Ping plunged into the horde, thousands of demonic corpses let out piercing shrieks from their rotting throats. A putrid stench hit him like a tangible force, their murky eyes glinting with greedy malice as they lunged at him frantically.
The first demonic corpse swung its sharp claws at him. Chen Ping dodged to the side, and the Dragon-Slaying Sword carved a crimson arc.
With a “sizzle,” the corpse was sliced in two at the waist, its severed edges burning with golden flames.
Astonishingly, the black malevolent energy escaping from the corpse’s remains didn’t dissipate. Instead, it was drawn by an invisible force, continuously flowing into Chen Ping’s body.
Chen Ping’s eyes were sharp as lightning, his Dragon-Slaying Sword dancing swiftly. Wherever the blade passed, the limbs of the demonic corpses were severed, and black corpse blood fell like rain.
With each demonic corpse slain, the malevolent energy within it slithered like a snake along the Dragon-Slaying Sword into Chen Ping’s body.
At first, Chen Ping had to consciously guide this energy to convert it. But as the battle continued, the absorption became increasingly natural and seamless.
