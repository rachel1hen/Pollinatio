This slap directly stunned the woman, who looked at Chen Ping in disbelief!
“You’ve got some nerve, daring to hit even me, I’ll tear you to pieces…”
The woman roared, but under Chen Ping’s suppression, she had no power to resist!
“You still want to tear me to pieces? Do you believe I’ll strip you bare right now?”
After Chen Ping spoke, he lightly tapped his palm, instantly shattering the white armour on the woman!
At this moment, the woman, in a tight-fitting outfit, had her exquisite curves strikingly accentuated.
Her figure was curvaceous, with captivating contours.
Seeing this, Hu Mazi’s drool flowed like a waterfall!
The woman’s face was full of anger and embarrassment!
Finally, she began to cry.
“Let my sister go, let my sister go…”
Seeing this, Huo Shizi shouted loudly!
Chen Ping ignored Huo Shizi and looked at the woman, saying, “Behave and listen, and I won’t hurt you.”
“Now, whatever I ask, you must answer, or I’ll strip you bare.”
“Then I’ll let this old man ride on you and torment you…”
The woman glanced at the drooling Hu Mazi, a flash of fear in her eyes.
“What’s your name?” Chen Ping asked.
The woman glared at Chen Ping but didn’t answer.
“Huo Jingjing, my sister’s name is Huo Jingjing…”
At this moment, Huo Shizi hurriedly said!
Huo Jingjing glared at her brother, her eyes full of helplessness!
Her brother was too cowardly, lacking any of the divine clan’s dignity.
“Why did your Eight Halls come to Cangxuan Continent? Are you still plundering resources and capturing slaves?”
Chen Ping asked Huo Jingjing!
Huo Jingjing remained silent, but Huo Shizi said, “I know, I know…”
“Feihu City has been occupied, so Father must find a new place, and Cangxuan Continent is the best choice.”
“Cangxuan Continent is vast enough, with plenty of people, and most importantly, it lacks strength, with its ruler only at the third rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, utterly pathetic.”
“Moreover, Cangxuan Continent has no backing forces, no experts in the Second or Third Heavens.”
“So, Cangxuan Continent is the easiest to bully…”
After Huo Shizi’s words, the tens of thousands of Cangxuan Continent cultivators felt utterly ashamed!
Though the words were harsh and infuriating, they were the truth.
Cangxuan Continent was vast, with many cultivators, but its overall strength was too weak.
The ruler of the entire continent was only at the third rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, unable to resist foreign enemies.
“I’m asking you, where is your father, Huo Zhao?”
Chen Ping asked Huo Jingjing!
“Hmph!” Huo Jingjing let out a cold snort!
This time, Huo Shizi couldn’t answer, as he didn’t know either, having been brought by Chen Ping from Xiniu City, unaware of his father’s whereabouts.
“If you don’t talk, I’ll strip you bare…”
As Chen Ping spoke, he moved to strip Huo Jingjing!
Mo Qingyun, standing nearby, couldn’t bear to watch, as she was also a woman, and using such methods on a girl, even from an enemy force, seemed too inhumane.
But before Mo Qingyun could speak, a terrifying pressure suddenly descended from the sky!
The weaker cultivators, caught off guard, fell to the ground, some even spitting blood and dying!
Huo Zhao arrived with over a hundred members of the Eight Halls, approaching in a grand procession!
“Chen Ping, you’ve got some nerve, release my daughter at once…”
“And you promised to let my son go, why did you break your word?”
Huo Zhao roared at Chen Ping, his face full of ferocity!
Chen Ping looked at the furious Huo Zhao and smiled faintly, “Retract your pressure, or I’ll make a move on your daughter.”
