To understand, the gap between the Immortal Transformation Realm and the Scattered Immortal Realm is an insurmountable chasm, one that countless cultivators cannot cross in their entire lives.
Yet Chen Ping achieved it, and in such a decisive manner.
“This, how is this possible?”
Niu Meng muttered to himself, wondering if he was dreaming.
He pinched his arm hard, the sharp pain snapping him back to reality, yet the scene before him was undeniably real.
His heart filled with awe and curiosity about Chen Ping. Just how many secrets did this young man hold?
Chen Ping walked up to Mad Immortal, looking down at him without a trace of pity in his eyes.
Mad Immortal struggled to sit up, gazing at Chen Ping with eyes full of confusion and shock, “You, who are you? How could someone in the Immortal Transformation Realm possibly defeat me?”
Chen Ping gave a cold smile, saying nothing, but slowly releasing the power of his bloodline.
In an instant—A dazzling golden light burst from his body, a faint shadow of a golden dragon appearing behind him, its roar echoing through the entire Purgatory Arena.
The noble and powerful aura made both Mad Immortal and Niu Meng feel a tremor in their hearts.
“Golden, Golden Dragon Bloodline!”
Mad Immortal’s eyes widened, his voice trembling as he spoke, his gaze filled with disbelief.
He never could have imagined that this young man before him possessed the Golden Dragon Bloodline.
It must be understood, the Golden Dragon lineage was the most noble among the beast clans, endowed with immense power and mysterious innate abilities, the kings of the beast clans.
In the legends of the beast clans, the Golden Dragon lineage had long vanished into the river of history, leaving only ancient records and tales.
Mad Immortal had once believed the Golden Dragon lineage was merely a myth, something that could not possibly exist in reality.
But now, seeing Chen Ping unleash the power of the Golden Dragon Bloodline with his own eyes, he realised it was all true.
“You, how could you possess the Golden Dragon Bloodline? It’s impossible, the Golden Dragon lineage went extinct long ago, where did you come from?”
Mad Immortal asked excitedly, desperate to uncover Chen Ping’s identity.
Chen Ping looked at Mad Immortal and said calmly, “I possess the Golden Dragon Bloodline, it is the will of heaven.”
“As for where I come from, that’s not important. What matters is that today, I will prove my strength in this Purgatory Arena.”
Mad Immortal fell silent, watching Chen Ping with a heart full of complex emotions.
There was shock, admiration, and a trace of envy.
He hadn’t expected that after spending centuries in this Purgatory Arena, believing himself invincible, he would be defeated today by a young cultivator in the Immortal Transformation Realm with the Golden Dragon Bloodline.
He felt his dignity had been greatly challenged, yet at the same time, he developed a trace of admiration for Chen Ping.
After all, to possess the Golden Dragon Bloodline and defeat him with the strength of the Immortal Transformation Realm was no ordinary feat.
“Very well, I lost to you today, and I accept it wholeheartedly.”
Mad Immortal let out a long sigh and said, “With the Golden Dragon Bloodline, your future achievements will surely be limitless. I hope you will use this power wisely and not bring calamity to the world.”
Chen Ping nodded and said, “Rest assured, I know my limits. There are still many unknown dangers in this Purgatory Arena, and I have no wish to make an enemy of you. Let today’s matter end here.”
Mad Immortal looked at Chen Ping, a flicker of approval in his eyes.
He stood up, brushed the dust off his body, and said, “Good, today I will turn our conflict into friendship.”
“However, this Purgatory Arena is fraught with dangers. If you wish to proceed, you must remain cautious.”
After speaking, Mad Immortal paused for a moment before continuing, “The evil spirits and demonic corpses here have been nearly wiped out by you. I know of a place where the sinister energy is even stronger, do you dare to go?”
