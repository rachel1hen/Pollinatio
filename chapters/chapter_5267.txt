Another hour passed, and Chen Ping finally ceased his efforts, exhausted to the point of collapse.
He looked at the person in the formation, a relieved smile spreading across his face.
Nan Batian couldn’t wait and rushed forward.
In the formation, a woman with a balanced figure and refined features slowly opened her eyes.
Her gaze was clear and gentle, though her face was still pale from the recent transformation, the faint outline of the former “A Cui” was visible, now enriched with a mature charm tempered by time.
“A Cui…” Nan Batian’s voice trembled as he reached out, hesitant, as if afraid this was merely a dream.
The woman looked at him, offering a shy yet sweet smile, reminiscent of the young girl from years past: “Brother Batian…”
Unable to hold back, Nan Batian pulled her into a tight embrace, tears streaming down his face: “It’s me, A Cui, I’m here…”
Years of estrangement, misunderstandings, and avoidance dissolved in that moment.
Their tight embrace seemed to make up for the decades they had lost.
Chen Ping, watching the tearful reunion, quietly slipped out of the chamber, leaving them space to be alone.
He knew these lovers could finally start anew.
A day later, A Cui’s condition fully stabilised.
Though her strength had indeed diminished, dropping to the level of early Nascent Soul, her face was filled with more smiles than ever, radiating a relaxed and joyful glow.
Nan Batian, too, let go of his burdens, staying by A Cui’s side constantly, the two inseparable like newlyweds.
A Cui and Nan Batian hosted a banquet to thank Chen Ping.
During the meal, A Cui raised her cup, respectfully saluting Chen Ping: “Mr. Chen, words cannot express my gratitude! You not only restored my appearance but also reunited me with Brother Batian. I, A Cui, will never forget this kindness!”
Nan Batian raised his cup as well: “Mr. Chen, you’re our great benefactor. If you ever need me, I’ll go through fire and water without hesitation!”
Chen Ping waved his hand modestly: “You’re too kind. It was a small effort, and seeing you two reunited makes me happy.”
A Cui set down her cup, her expression turning serious: “Mr. Chen, you mentioned before that you’ve been tracking the Evil Path Hall, correct?”
Chen Ping nodded: “That’s right.”
A Cui continued: “My Information Building’s intelligence network spans far and wide. Over the years, we’ve gathered quite a bit of information about the Evil Path Hall. Their operations are secretive, and the location of their main headquarters is unknown, but we’ve uncovered clues about their branch halls.”
She paused, pulling a map from her storage bag and spreading it on the table, pointing to a marked spot: “This branch hall, in particular, is hidden beneath an abandoned ancient battlefield deep in the Black Wind Mountain Range. This branch is extremely powerful, and its master is a highly skilled demon, rumoured to hold many of the Evil Path Hall’s core secrets. I was too preoccupied with my own issues to pursue them before, but now, I’m giving you this precise location in hopes it will aid you.”
Chen Ping looked at the clear mark on the map, a glint of determination in his eyes.
He knew this was a crucial step in his pursuit of the Evil Path Hall.
“Thank you, Building Master!” Chen Ping carefully stored the map, “This gift is invaluable!”
A Cui smiled: “I’m just glad to help. But be very careful, the demon in that branch hall is formidable. If you need assistance, come to us anytime.”
Nan Batian nodded: “Exactly, Mr. Chen, take care. If you need me, I’ll go with you.”
A wave of warmth surged in Chen Ping’s heart, and he nodded: “Alright, if I need help, I’ll find you.”
In truth, Chen Ping didn’t want to impose too much on Nan Batian. Now that Nan Batian and A Cui had just reconciled, they needed time together.
Though Nan Batian had agreed to serve him for three hundred years, Chen Ping had no intention of truly treating him as a servant.
