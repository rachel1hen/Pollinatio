When the white-robed woman reached the stone platform, she took a deep breath and slowly stepped onto it.
At the same time, a blazing light condensed in her hand, ready to strike and meet any attack from the two warrior statues.
But when she stepped onto the platform, the statues did not attack her.
Seeing this, the white-robed woman let out a sigh of relief.
“What’s going on?” Tianci frowned, looking somewhat embarrassed.
The white-robed woman beckoned, and the three black-robed elders also walked towards the platform, moving cautiously. Fortunately, the two warrior statues did not attack them either.
Seeing the people from Shura Hall all reach the platform, Tianci could no longer hold back.
“Elder Tong, I’ll go try first…” Tianci said.
“Let’s go together. These two statues probably won’t attack anymore,” Elder Tong replied, heading towards the platform.
Tianci, bringing Mo Qingyun along, followed closely behind.
When they stepped onto the platform, the statues did not attack. Tianci glanced at them in surprise but dared not look too closely.
“Ah… it’s not fair…”
The man in green robes, lying on the ground gravely injured, felt his heart sink as he saw everyone safely ascend the platform.
“Why, why is it only targeting me…” he roared in frustration.
“I told you, it’s because you’re not handsome enough…” Chen Ping said lightly.
Pfft…
The man in green robes, furious, spat out a mouthful of blood and fainted.
No one paid him any attention, as they had no ties to him, and no one would waste time on a stranger.
The group stood on the platform, gazing at the three coffins before them.
The blood-like red glow flowing on the coffins and the smell of blood left everyone puzzled.
The white-robed woman instantly released her divine sense, trying to probe what was inside the coffins.
But her divine sense couldn’t penetrate them; it vanished the moment it touched the coffins.
Everyone tried, but none succeeded.
Chen Ping, confident that his divine sense was the strongest, also failed to penetrate the coffins, so the others had even less hope.
The white-robed woman closely examined the mysterious runes on the coffins but couldn’t decipher them.
Elder Tong slowly crouched down, studying them carefully, while Tianci watched silently, not daring to speak.
Chen Ping pulled Mo Qingyun aside.
If something strange happened with the coffins, they could escape early.
Though this ruin held opportunities, it also came with risks, as opportunities and dangers always went hand in hand.
“Senior, do you know which sect this ruin belongs to?” Chen Ping asked Chiyun Demon Lord.
“No idea. How would I know about a Second Heaven ruin? Don’t forget, I’m from the Ninth Heaven,” Chiyun Demon Lord said, shaking his head.
“You weren’t born in the Ninth Heaven. What’s wrong with asking?” Chen Ping rolled his eyes.
“Damn it, I was born in the Ninth Heaven…” Chiyun Demon Lord roared.
Chen Ping was speechless…
This guy had it good, born straight into Rome…
Meanwhile, Elder Tong was still carefully studying the coffins, and even the people from Shura Hall watched with bated breath.
They knew that among them, only Elder Tong understood the art of arrays.
The runes on the coffins were likely array runes.
Elder Tong used the method he had employed to open the stone gate, attempting to open the three coffins.
Seeing this, Chen Ping pulled Mo Qingyun down from the platform.
If the array’s taboo was broken and an undead corpse jumped out, it would be trouble.
