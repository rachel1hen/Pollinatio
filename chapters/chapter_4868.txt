Chen Ping’s face was ashen; he hadn’t expected Ming Shao’s father to show up too!
Now, with all of them in a state of exhaustion, how could they possibly stand a chance against Ming Shao’s father?
Fear crept across many faces, even the five Domain Lords could only grit their teeth and hold on, unable to spare a thought for anything else!
Despair!
A deep sense of hopelessness filled everyone’s hearts!
In the face of absolute power, they were truly helpless!
Chen Ping clenched his jaw, the various energies within him surging wildly, yet he still couldn’t break free from that oppressive force!
Buzz!
Suddenly, a mysterious power erupted between heaven and earth, shattering the overwhelming pressure in an instant!
Everyone let out a long sigh of relief.
Ming Tian’s expression tightened, and he couldn’t help but glance around!
At that moment, an old man shrouded in black mist approached slowly. As the mist dissipated, Chen Ping’s face lit up with joy!
But when Ming Tian saw the old man, his body jolted, and he dropped to his knees with a thud!
“Father…” Seeing his father kneel, Ming Shao was stunned!
“Kneel down, now!”
Ming Tian yanked Ming Shao, forcing him to kneel as well!
“Ming Tian of the Four Nether Palaces pays respects to the Yin Demon Ancestor…”
Ming Tian slammed his forehead to the ground, not daring to meet the Yin Demon’s eyes!
But the Yin Demon walked past him without so much as a glance, heading straight for Chen Ping!
“Senior, you’ve reconstructed your physical body?”
Seeing that the Yin Demon now had a flesh-and-blood form, Chen Ping asked excitedly!
“Hahaha, all thanks to you, little brother,” the Yin Demon laughed heartily, patting Chen Ping on the shoulder, “Your strength has grown tremendously in this time!”
“Compared to you, Senior, my little bit of strength is nothing worth mentioning!” Chen Ping said modestly!
“I’ve cultivated for tens of thousands of years, how long have you been at it? If you cultivate for tens of thousands of years, your achievements will surely surpass mine!”
The Yin Demon praised Chen Ping warmly!
Nearby, Lin Chong and the others saw the Yin Demon and instinctively stepped back. Even without the Yin Demon emitting any aura, they felt uneasy, a shiver of dread running through them!
The five Domain Lords watched the Yin Demon with trembling expressions, especially the Western Domain Lord, who was dumbfounded seeing Chen Ping so chummy with him!
One glance from Mr. Shi had scared him witless, and now here was another expert whose realm he couldn’t even fathom. He couldn’t understand just how many powerhouses Chen Ping had backing him!
Even Li Chunfeng, Nan Batian, and Wuji Daoist, beings from the Celestial Realm, felt their breaths quicken at the Yin Demon’s appearance!
Clearly, even in the Celestial Realm, their strength paled in comparison to the Yin Demon’s!
Ming Tian, listening to the Yin Demon chat with Chen Ping, was struck dumb!
Ming Shao’s legs shook uncontrollably, and he wet himself in terror!
His face showed nothing but fear, not a trace of his former bravado remaining!
He couldn’t believe that Chen Ping, a mere Great Ascension Realm cultivator, was so familiar with the Yin Demon Ancestor of their lineage!
And it seemed the Yin Demon and Chen Ping were old acquaintances.
“Senior, the cultivators of your lineage sure love to show off. If you hadn’t shown up just now, I’d probably be a corpse by now!”
Chen Ping glanced at the trembling Ming Shao, smiling faintly!
Only then did the Yin Demon cast a cold glance at Ming Tian and his son, snorting, “With this level of strength, they dare not call themselves part of my lineage, they’re an embarrassment.”
“Go ahead and finish them off, I won’t bother doing it myself…”
The Yin Demon’s words made Ming Tian tremble even more violently, while Ming Shao soiled himself in a mess of fear!
“Ancestor, spare us, spare us, please…”
Ming Tian kowtowed desperately, begging for mercy!
“Senior, just kill his son. That brat’s too full of himself and has killed plenty of my people!” Chen Ping didn’t want the Four Nether Palaces destroyed entirely!
If the Four Nether Palaces could be persuaded to join him, he could lead them, along with the people of Sun-Moon City, to the Fire Incineration Sect to rescue the Refining Sect’s leader!
As the top power in the Celestial Realm, Chen Ping knew the Fire Incineration Sect wouldn’t be easy to deal with.
