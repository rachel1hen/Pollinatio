“Nowadays, the ruler of the Cangxuan Continent is my dear sister. I only returned from the Second Heaven because I learned that the Cangxuan Continent was in trouble.”
“Originally, I planned to settle scores with Feihu City, but I didn’t expect to run into you lot.”
“Now my sister has informed me through telepathy that someone is forcibly trying to control the Cangxuan Continent.”
Mo Qingyun was telling Chen Ping everything truthfully!
Since Chen Ping had taken her to the Demon-Suppressing Tower, Mo Qingyun no longer treated him as an outsider!
So, she had no guard up against Chen Ping at all.
“It’s probably the people from the Eight Halls. I’ll go with you to the Cangxuan Continent to take a look!”
Chen Ping said.
After all, Mo Qingyun had helped him a lot, and now Chen Ping couldn’t just stand by and watch her die!
Moreover, he wanted to visit the human realm to see if he could run into Su Yuqi!
“Big brother, I’ll go with you!” Crazy Immortal suddenly popped up and said!
“You’d better stay and guard Rhino City. You’re a beast clan member, not suited for the human realm.”
“Master Hu, come with me instead, he’s human!”
Chen Ping said to Hu Mazi.
“What? I have to run around with you again? This last trip nearly killed me!”
“If I go with you, what about my two girls?”
Hu Mazi was reluctant!
“Bring them along. Those two women are human too. It’s perfect to take them to the Cangxuan Continent so they can return to a normal life!”
Chen Ping said.
They couldn’t just leave the two women in Rhino City with nothing to do, waiting for Hu Mazi all day, could they?
“That works!” Hu Mazi nodded upon hearing this.
Chen Ping didn’t dawdle any further. He bid farewell to Niu Meng and left!
He didn’t say goodbye to Bai Yi, as Bai Yi was still immersed in grief!
Chen Ping needed to find a way to bring Bai Qian to the Heavenly Realm. That way, someone could keep Bai Yi company, and he might feel better!
Chen Ping and his group headed straight for the Cangxuan Continent, bringing along that Huo Shizi!
If the Cangxuan Continent was indeed being targeted by the Eight Halls, they could use Huo Shizi to threaten Huo Zhao.
At this moment, the Cangxuan Continent had already fallen into turmoil!
When the Great Elder of the Eight Halls arrived with his people, the Cangxuan Continent was thrown into chaos!
Now, Huo Zhao had personally brought more people, leaving the Cangxuan Continent with no ability to resist whatsoever!
In a resplendent palace on the Cangxuan Continent!
The kings of the three largest nations had gathered here!
Among them was Ayisha’s father, Ashnu. They had all gathered here, waiting for the ruler of the Cangxuan Continent, Blue Lotus.
But they had already waited an entire day, and the throne in the palace remained empty, with no sign of Blue Lotus!
“I say we stop waiting and just submit obediently. Even if the Mysterious Lady comes, she’s no match for those people. They’re all from the God Clan.”
The king of Dongmeng Kingdom stood up angrily, ready to leave!
Ashnu frowned and said, “Whoever dares to be a traitor, don’t blame my blade for being merciless…”
“Ashnu, what’s that supposed to mean?” The king of Dongmeng Kingdom glared.
“What do I mean? You want to be a traitor, and I’m the first to object.”
“The people of our Cangxuan Continent can die fighting, but we cannot submit. For so many years, haven’t our human race been humiliated enough?”
“It’s because of cowards like you that our human race has fallen so low.”
Ashnu said furiously!
“You’re talking nonsense! Say that again!” The king of Dongmeng Kingdom was enraged too!
“Enough, both of you shut up and wait for what the Mysterious Lady says!” At this moment, the king of Chelie Kingdom stood up to mediate.
Just then, a blue light suddenly flashed on the throne!
Seeing this, the three of them knelt down, bowing their heads!
A young girl dressed in blue appeared on the throne!
