The Savage King of Cracked Mountain and Lady Meixin halted their attacks, staring warily at Chen Ping, enveloped in black mist, the aura radiating a threat of death.
“Roar…”
A bellow, as if from the depths of the underworld, echoed from the black mist, then it slowly dissipated, revealing Chen Ping’s figure.
But Chen Ping was no longer the same.
His hair had turned a blazing crimson, standing on end, his eyes glinting with an eerie red glow, his face covered in intricate black patterns, like demonic totems.
His body had swelled, muscles bulging with explosive power, his skin gleaming with a bronze, metallic sheen.
Most terrifying was the aura he exuded, a horrifying pressure blending destruction, savagery, and majesty, causing the heavens to shift and the void to shatter and reform.
“This… this is…”
Mo Qingyun gazed at the familiar yet alien Chen Ping, tears blurring her eyes, sensing the terrifying power within him, yet also his unwavering resolve.
The onlookers stared at the transformed Chen Ping, utterly shocked!
“This kid, he’s possessed by a demon, everyone be careful!”
The old Taoist Xuanzhi hurriedly warned!
“Unbelievable, he’s hiding a demon’s soul within him, isn’t he afraid of being devoured and dying?”
Lady Meixin said, utterly baffled!
Though possession could vastly boost strength, if the body couldn’t withstand the power, it would be reduced to ashes!
Amid the crowd’s shock, Chen Ping slowly raised his head, red light bursting from his eyes.
A cold smirk curled his lips, his voice now hoarse and commanding, laced with a sneer, “Three ants dare to bully my brother, seeking death?”
Before his words faded, he vanished, instantly appearing before the Savage King of Cracked Mountain.
The Savage King roared, mustering all his strength, and threw a punch, “I don’t care who you are, die!”
Yet Chen Ping casually raised his hand, meeting the punch with his own.
“Boom…”
A muffled sound, quieter than any prior clash, yet far more terrifying.
The Savage King’s powerful fist, upon meeting Chen Ping’s, emitted the sound of breaking bones.
He was flung back as if struck by a speeding train, screaming, spitting blood in mid-air, crashing into a distant mountain, collapsing it entirely.
“What?”
The old Taoist Xuanzhi and Lady Meixin gasped in unison, their eyes filled with disbelief and fear.
They knew the Savage King’s physical strength well, even they couldn’t easily injure him in a direct clash, yet this possessed Chen Ping had done so with one punch!
“Your turn!”
Chen Ping’s eyes flashed red, locking onto Lady Meixin.
Her face paled, all traces of her earlier allure gone, she screamed, turning to flee, her blood-red bell shaking frantically to disrupt with sound waves.
But Chen Ping was faster, his figure like a spectre, appearing behind her, striking with a palm.
“Ah…”
Lady Meixin let out a piercing scream, her body flying like a broken kite.
Her blood-red bell shattered with a “crack,” a massive palm print appeared on her back, bones crushed, blood spraying wildly.
The old Taoist Xuanzhi, terrified, knew he was no match, hurriedly casting spells to detonate the Bagua diagram to block while preparing to escape.
“Trying to run?”
Chen Ping sneered, red light from his eyes shooting like lasers, instantly piercing the Bagua diagram.
Then, with one step, he appeared before the old Taoist, his Dragon-Slaying Sword flashing with world-destroying intent, slashing towards him.
