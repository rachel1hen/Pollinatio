Qin Lie glared at him. “Old Ghost Zhang, this little beast killed my disciple, and you still protect him?”
“Protect?”
Overseer Zhang stroked his beard, his gaze sweeping the arena. “What happened just now was seen clearly by thousands of eyes. Zhao Jingfeng attacked after surrendering. Chen Ping acted in self-defence, blameless in both reason and law. But you, Master Qin, would you defy Sword Saint City’s rules and seek revenge in public?”
The sect leaders and elders around chimed in.
“Brother Zhang is right. Zhao Jingfeng couldn’t accept defeat. His death was deserved.”
“Divine Sword Manor claims to be a righteous sect, yet it produced such a vile character.”
“If Master Qin acts forcefully today, he makes an enemy of all cultivators.”
The chorus of voices surged toward Qin Lie like a tide. Feeling the scornful gazes and countless pointing fingers behind him, his aged face flushed red, as if splashed with blood.
“Fine. Fine. All cultivators, you say?”
Qin Lie spun toward Chen Ping, his eyes venomous as a snake. “Little beast, mark my words. Today’s humiliation, today’s grudge, Divine Sword Manor will repay a hundredfold. Sword Sect protects you? I’ll see if they can shield you forever.”
Chen Ping stood tall, wiping blood from his mouth. The Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand trembled slightly, emitting a low dragon’s hum.
He looked at Qin Lie, his voice soft but clear across the arena. “I, Chen Ping, am here in Sword Saint City, awaiting Divine Sword Manor’s visit anytime. But if you dare scheme again, it won’t end with mere dismemberment.”
“You!”
Qin Lie trembled with rage but restrained his killing intent under Overseer Zhang’s icy stare.
He cast a deep glance at the corpse on the ground, then flung his sleeve and barked at his disciples. “Take Zhao Jingfeng’s body. We leave.”
A group of Divine Sword Manor disciples hurried forward, wrapping Zhao Jingfeng’s body in white cloth, retreating in disgrace under countless scornful gazes.
As Qin Lie vanished at the city gate, his venomous vow lingered like a spectre. “Chen Ping, Sword Sect… we’ll see about that.”
Only when Divine Sword Manor’s people were gone did the tense atmosphere on the arena ease slightly.
Overseer Zhang looked at Chen Ping, his expression complex. “Do you know that killing Zhao Jingfeng is like stirring a hornet’s nest?”
Chen Ping bowed. “This junior understands, but where my path lies, I will go, even against thousands. If I tolerate a sneak attack, what sword path do I cultivate?”
“Well said, where your path lies.”
Overseer Zhang laughed heartily. “I didn’t misjudge you. Today’s events, Sword Saint City will bear witness. If Divine Sword Manor dares retaliate openly here, I won’t allow it.”
He paused, producing a jade token etched with sword patterns. “This is Sword Saint City’s ‘Path Guardian Token.’ With it, you can move freely among the seven sword sects of the Fifth Heaven. If Divine Sword Manor provokes you, use this to seek aid from the sects.”
Chen Ping took the token, warm to the touch, faintly pulsing with spiritual energy. “Thank you, Senior Zhang.”
“Your wounds are severe. Go heal.”
Overseer Zhang patted his shoulder. “The sword tournament’s champion is undoubtedly you.”
Mo Chen rushed to support Chen Ping. “Chen Ping, I’ll take you to heal.”
Ling Xue and Hu Mazi crowded around, eyes red at the sight of Chen Ping’s wound.
Surrounded by Sword Sect disciples, they left the arena. Onlookers parted to make way, their gazes toward Chen Ping filled with awe.
This young man, an eighth-rank Loose Immortal who defeated Earth Immortal experts and slew Divine Sword Manor’s genius, had stunned all of Sword Saint City with a resounding victory.
Back at the Sword Sect’s courtyard, Mo Chen produced healing pills, personally tending to Chen Ping’s wounds.
