“Kid, you seek death.”
“Kill …………”
Qiu Tu shouted and took the lead in stabbing his sword towards Chen Ping!
Following closely behind, that Qian Yue and Master Luan also launched an attack on Chen Ping together!
With Qiu Tu’s shout, a thrilling battle officially began.
Sword light like electricity, cut through the sky, Qiu Tu holding a cold light flashing long sword, the tip of the sword cohesion of the rich spiritual energy, with the sound of the air, straight to Chen Ping’s chest.
Chen Ping’s color was calm, his body shape was like a ghost, gently sidestepping, he dodged this thunderous strike.
At the same time, his right hand quickly probed out, his palm flashed with lightning, and he blasted his fist towards Qiu Tu’s side ribs.
“Bang!”The fist wind collided with the sword awnings, emitting a deafening explosion.
Qiu Tu only felt a huge force coming from him, his body involuntarily fell back a few steps, his face slightly blanched.
Chen Ping, on the other hand, was as steady as a mountain, standing in place, his gaze even more stern.
Right at this moment, Qian Yue and Master Luan also launched an attack.
Qian Yue held a short blade in his hand, his body was agile like a cunning fox, roaming around Chen Ping, looking for an opportunity to strike.
On the other hand, Master Luan made seals with both hands, reciting words under his breath, a cold aura emanated from his body, gradually forming a black vortex that seemed to be sucking Chen Ping into it.
In the face of the two men’s pincer attack, Chen Ping was undaunted, his body shape surged up like a downhill tiger, with a wave of his left hand, a wall of flames appeared out of thin air, blocking Qian Yue’s short blade outside.
At the same time, he stomped his feet, his entire body was like an arrow off the string, rushing towards Master Luan.
“Hmph, small carving skill!”
Master Luan snorted coldly, his hands changed their sealing techniques, and the black vortex suddenly accelerated and spun, a powerful suction force coming from it, wanting to involve Chen Ping in it.
However, Chen Ping was prepared for this, as the spiritual energy in his body surged, forming a layer of golden shield that resisted the suction force.
Right at this moment, Qian Yue saw the opportunity and sneaked in from Chen Ping’s blind spot.
The short blade flashed with a cold light in the sunlight, aiming straight for Chen Ping’s back heart.
However, at the moment when the short blade was about to touch Chen Ping’s skin, Chen Ping’s figure once again strangely sidestepped, and at the same time, his right hand turned into a claw and grabbed Qian Yue’s wrist.
“Ah!”
Qian Yue let out a cry of pain, only to feel a strong force coming from him, making him almost unable to move.
Chen Ping took this opportunity to twist with force, only to hear a “click”, Qian Yue’s wrist was fractured.
“Waste!”
Chen Ping snorted coldly and threw Qian Yue aside like a piece of trash.
At this time, Master Luan saw that the situation was not good, he also no longer retained his strength, his hands changed again, only to see that the black vortex suddenly gushed out a strand of black tentacles, like poisonous snakes winding towards Chen Ping.
Chen Ping’s eyes condensed, his body’s spiritual energy surged crazily, only to see his hands wave, a golden flame erupted from the center of his palm, instantly incinerating those black tentacles.
At the same time, his figure once again rose up, like a golden lightning, straight to Master Luan.
Master Luan was shocked, he did not expect Chen Ping’s strength to be so powerful.
However, at this time, it was already too late to escape, only to see Chen Ping blast out his fist, the wind of the fist was like a dragon, carrying a blazing golden flame, directly bombarding Master Luan’s chest.
“Bang!”
With a loud bang, Grandmaster Luan flew out backwards like a kite with broken strings and fell heavily on the ground.
He was spitting blood from his mouth and his face was as pale as paper, obviously he had been seriously injured.
At this moment, when Qiu Tu saw that Qian Yue and Master Luan were both injured, a chill could not help but rise in his heart.
He knew that he was not Chen Ping’s opponent, and if he continued to fight, he was afraid that he would only die.
However, as the son of the Qiu Mansion, how could he easily admit defeat?
“Kid, don’t get complacent too early! My Qiu Mansion has many experts, even if I die here today, you won’t be able to leave alive!”
Qiu Tint shouted in a stern manner.
