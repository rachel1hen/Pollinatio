Criminal Daorong sneered, a long spear appeared instantly in his hand, with a wave of the long spear, the wind rose and the air around him seemed to freeze, a powerful aura emanated from his body, like a mountain oppressing the surrounding crowd.
Criminal Dao Rong coldly laughed, ”If you want my Admiral Criminal Dao Rong’s life, it depends on whether you have the ability to do so! Today, let us come to an end!”
Seeing this, the men and horses from both sides retreated, leaving an open battlefield.
Criminal Daorong and Qiu Wanha glanced at each other, and in their eyes were both burning with battle intent, as if they wanted to devour each other.
“Come on, let’s make an end today!”
Qiu Wanha let out a low roar, his figure stormed up like a downhill tiger, pouncing straight at Interdiction Daorong.
He formed his hands into fists, his fists were wrapped with berserk true qi, like two streaks of lightning, cutting through the sky and striking directly at Interdiction Daorong’s chest.
Criminal Daorong snorted coldly, not retreating but advancing, his spear was like a dragon, aiming straight for Qiu Wanha’s vitals.
His body is flexible, like a swimming dragon weaving in and out of the battlefield, the spear seems to have a life in his hands, each strike contains the power to crack mountains and rocks, pointing straight at Qiu Wanha’s throat, heart and other fatal places.
The two instantly exchanged blows, the gun shadow and fist wind intertwined, causing rocks to splash and dust to fly.
Every move and every style was full of power and skill, as if they wanted to level the entire mountain. Their figures moved quickly across the battlefield like two streaks of lightning, dazzling people and making it difficult to catch them.
“Boom!”With a loud bang, the two men each took several steps back, and the ground was shaken by their power to crack open a gap, as if the earth was trembling.
The people watching the battle in the surroundings were all terrified, this kind of might was simply rare on earth.
They retreated one after another, fearing that they would be caught in the middle of this terrifying battle.
Qiu Wanha roared, his entire body’s true qi boiling, his two fists wrapped in the sound of violent winds and thunder, once again rushing towards Interdictor Dao Rong.
Each of his fists seemed to carry the power of the heavens and earth as it blasted against Interdiction Daorong’s lance, emitting a deafening roar.
Xing Daorong also did not show any weakness, his long spear danced, the tip of the spear flashed with a cold aura, like a silver dragon flying in the air, each strike was precise and deadly.
The battle between the two grew more and more intense, their moves were deadly and shocking.
Their figures moved quickly on the battlefield, sometimes leaping high into the air, sometimes swooping down to the ground, as if they were engaged in a dance between life and death.
The sky was covered with dark clouds and thunder roared, as if even the heavens and earth were being shaken by this unprecedented battle.
Criminal Dao Rong suddenly shouted, his long spear drew a brilliant trajectory in the air, like a shooting star crossing the night sky, striking directly at the top of Qiu Wan Ha’s head.
Qiu Wanha let out a cold snort, his body shape sidestepped, narrowly dodging the strike.
However, the long spear of Ding Daorong was as if it had a spiritual nature, making a turn in the air and stabbing towards Qiu Wanha’s waist again.
Qiu Wanha was shocked and hastily dodged sideways, but the spear’s sharpness still cut through his lapel, leaving a deep wound.
He roared angrily and formed his hands into claws, clawing towards Xing Daorong’s chest in an attempt to suppress his opponent with his melee advantage.
With a cold snort, Xing Daorong’s figure leapt backward, dodging Qiu Wanha’s attack.
He shook his spear, and the tip of the spear stabbed at Qiu Wanha like rain, each shot precise and fast, as if he wanted to pierce Qiu Wanha’s body into a sieve.
Not to be outdone, Qiu Wanha danced with his hands, forming a barrier of true qi in an attempt to ward off Xing Daorong’s attacks.
However, Xing Daorong’s spear was like the light of dawn, penetrating through the layers of barriers and pushing straight into Qiu Wanha’s vitals.
The two of them fought back and forth, and the entire heaven and earth seemed to change color.
Their figures moved quickly across the battlefield, sometimes crossing paths, sometimes fighting side by side, as if they were engaged in a silent contest.
