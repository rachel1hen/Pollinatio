“So, the Divine Clan cultivators are all so elegant, but I have heard that many among the temple’s cultivators are practising evil arts, and the cultivators in the temple seem to all be from the Divine Clan as well.” Chen Ping said indifferently.
Zi Yuan was stunned for a moment, then said, “The Divine Clan’s group is vast, it is normal to have some trash, anyway, the cultivators of our Divine Kingdom are absolutely all elegant people.”
The corners of Chen Ping’s mouth slightly curved up, pulling out a faint arc. That smile hid a bit of mockery, and he did not follow Zi Yuan’s words to praise the elegance of the Divine Kingdom’s citizens.
“Miss Zi, what classics and histories do they study in this academy?”
Chen Ping asked curiously, his tone carrying a bit of casualness, but in reality, he was secretly observing the surrounding environment.
The academy was filled with a faint spiritual energy fluctuation, completely different from the hustle and bustle of the divine capital’s streets. It seemed to hide some unknown power.
Since you are so curious about the academy, then I will take you to visit it.
Zi Yuan took Chen Ping out of the Moon Gazing Pavilion, heading straight to the academy.
Zi Yuan saw that Chen Ping’s gaze towards the academy was full of curiosity and shock, a flash of pride passed through her eyes. She walked into the academy with graceful steps.
Both sides of the academy were guarded by divine guards, but upon seeing Zi Yuan, they all saluted. No one blocked them, which showed Zi Yuan’s status in the Divine Kingdom.
“To understand our academy, one must go to the library to study properly.”
Zi Yuan took Chen Ping to the library.
For such an important place, Zi Yuan actually dared to bring Chen Ping here. Chen Ping was very surprised.
“Miss Zi, we have just met, and you bring me to the library. Are you not afraid that I will spy on your Divine Clan’s secrets?”
Chen Ping asked curiously.
“Hahaha, this library only contains some of our Divine Clan’s classics, recording the ancient glories, inheriting the wisdom of our ancestors.”
“The students study here, they can comprehend the ultimate principles of heaven and earth, cultivate their body and mind, and learn the way of etiquette.”
“If you want to learn, you can take a look. Then you will not be like those cultivators from lower worlds, who only know fighting and killing, without any foundation.”
As she spoke, her eyes intentionally or unintentionally swept towards Chen Ping. The contempt in her words was not concealed at all.
Chen Ping snorted coldly in his heart, but his face still wore a gentle smile. He strolled to the bookshelf, casually pulled out an ancient book.
Upon opening it, it recorded nothing but the glorious history of the Divine Clan, with many derogatory words towards other races. The text was filled with arrogance and prejudice.
The so-called Divine Clan is just the human race, but some cultivators feel they have extraordinary talents and noble status. They deliberately separated themselves from the human race, creating an additional Divine Clan.
Over time, the Divine Clan grew larger and larger, after all, many cultivators take pride in having the Divine Clan identity.
Chen Ping closed the book impassively, turned to look at Zi Yuan, and asked, “Miss Zi, in your opinion, between studying and cultivation, which one is more important?”
Zi Yuan’s willow eyebrows slightly raised, she replied without thinking, “Naturally, both are important. Cultivation can enhance strength, protect our Divine Clan’s dignity. Studying can clarify the mind and see one’s nature, allowing our Divine Clan to eternally enjoy the light of civilisation.”
“Fellow Daoist Chen, you come from the Fifth Heaven, presumably the cultivators there only focus on cultivation, but neglect inner cultivation, right?”
As she spoke, she observed Chen Ping’s expression, trying to find flaws in his reaction.
Chen Ping thought darkly in his heart, this Zi Yuan is indeed pressing step by step, but how could he easily reveal flaws.
He shook his head slightly, pretending to sigh, “What Miss Zi said is absolutely right, most cultivators in the Fifth Heaven are busy for survival. They indeed have no time to attend to these.”
“I am also fortunate to come to the Divine Kingdom and witness such prosperous civilisation. But I am thinking, if one is immersed solely in ancient books, ignoring the changes in the outside world, how can this strength be improved?”
