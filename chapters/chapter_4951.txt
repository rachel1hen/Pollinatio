“Though this is the Heavenly Realm, the distribution of resources is extremely unfair. Even if cultivators in the three Heavens reach the Scattered Immortal Realm, they’re looked down upon, and no one acknowledges them as true immortals.”
“I’ve trapped myself in this Purgatory Arena for so many years, hoping one day to break out of the three Heavens and become a true, upright immortal.”
As Mad Immortal spoke, his gaze instinctively drifted toward the sky.
“Senior, what grade of the Scattered Immortal Realm have you reached now?” Chen Ping asked.
Chen Ping wanted to gauge how his ninth-grade Immortal Transformation Realm strength stacked up against the Scattered Immortal Realm, to have a sense of his limits.
Otherwise, he might overestimate himself, act recklessly, and suffer for it.
“I’ve reached the peak of the second grade of the Scattered Immortal Realm. It won’t be long before I break through to the third grade.”
“Once I reach the third grade, I can go to the Second Heaven,” Mad Immortal said.
“What? Only the peak of the second grade?” Chen Ping felt a pang of disappointment.
Mad Immortal froze, glaring at Chen Ping with some irritation, “What do you know? Reaching the Scattered Immortal Realm, even if the immortals of the Heavenly Realm don’t acknowledge it, still counts as being an immortal.”
“Every step of cultivation beyond that is incredibly difficult. Do you think it’s like cultivating in the lower realms?”
“Some cultivators take a thousand years, or even longer, to advance from the first grade to the second grade of the Scattered Immortal Realm.”
Seeing Mad Immortal so worked up, Chen Ping quickly apologised, “Senior, I’m sorry. I haven’t reached the Scattered Immortal Realm, so I don’t understand.”
“When you reach the Scattered Immortal Realm, you’ll see. Whether it’s the consumption of resources or the difficulty of cultivation, it increases exponentially,” Mad Immortal said, feeling better after Chen Ping’s apology.
“Senior, let me ask you, are there any cultivators above the third grade of the Scattered Immortal Realm in the First Heaven?”
Chen Ping asked.
“It’s not that there aren’t any, but they’re extremely rare. Those who reach above the third grade usually go straight to the Second Heaven, where the resources and environment are far better than in the First Heaven.”
“But some stay in the First Heaven, likely due to personal ties. However, people from the Second Heaven can return to the First Heaven at any time, so it’s hard to answer your question definitively.”
Mad Immortal explained.
Chen Ping felt a bit disappointed. He had thought the First Heaven only had third-grade Scattered Immortal cultivators, and anyone stronger would have gone to the Second Heaven.
If that were the case, with his current strength, he might have been able to sweep through the First Heaven.
During his fight with Mad Immortal, Chen Ping felt he still had energy to spare, and facing a third-grade Scattered Immortal didn’t seem impossible.
Not to mention, Chen Ping hadn’t even used his many trump cards.
The Heaven-Devouring Beast, the Fire Qilin, the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord, and his various divine weapons.
Even against a third-grade Scattered Immortal, Chen Ping had no fear.
“Don’t be discouraged. With your current Immortal Transformation Realm cultivation, you’ve defeated me. There may not be anyone in the entire First Heaven with such talent.”
“And your Golden Dragon Bloodline, countless people would envy it. Your bloodline is a hundred times stronger than those common beast clan creatures.”
Seeing Chen Ping’s expression, Mad Immortal thought he was disheartened about his own realm being too low and offered some encouragement.
“Senior, what kind of beast clan animal were you originally?” Chen Ping asked.
“I…” Mad Immortal paused, then continued, “I’ve been in human form for many, many years. I’ve long forgotten my original form.”
Chen Ping chuckled inwardly.
He guessed Mad Immortal’s original form wasn’t some noble creature, yet he called others common cats and dogs.
“You should hurry and absorb that baleful energy. I’ll stand guard for you here,” Mad Immortal said.
“Senior, aren’t you going in?” Chen Ping asked, curious.
Mad Immortal had brought him here but wasn’t going in himself, which seemed a bit odd.
