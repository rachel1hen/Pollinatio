“The Hu Clan?”
The old man cackled as if he’d heard a joke, “I’ve been stationed here for a hundred years and never heard of any Hu Clan. The Nine Coiled Mountains have long been unclaimed, and my Black Fiend Demon Palace took it, simple as that. A lowly human like you dares to demand an explanation?”
” Courting death!”
Hu Mazi’s rage boiled over, his spiritual energy erupting fiercely. Though his current cultivation was far from his peak before reincarnation, his strength was still formidable. His hands formed seals, and a massive, earthen-yellow palm shot out, carrying the force to shatter mountains as it roared towards the old man.
“Overestimating yourself,” the old man sneered cruelly, not even bothering to summon a treasure. With a casual wave, a condensed claw of demonic energy tore the yellow palm apart effortlessly.
The demonic claw’s momentum didn’t falter, slamming into Hu Mazi’s chest.
“Pfft!”
Hu Mazi, struck heavily, spat out a mouthful of blood, his body flying back like a broken kite, crashing into the ground and creating a deep crater.
“Master Hu!” Chen Ping’s eyes turned icy. In a flash, he positioned himself in front of Hu Mazi, his Dragon-Slaying Sword pointed at the old man, “A Demon Clan cultivator dares to act so arrogantly before me?”
The old man sized Chen Ping up, his disdain growing upon seeing his Sixth Grade Loose Immortal Realm cultivation, “Another ignorant brat. You think killing a few reckless beasts means you can strut around the Fourth Heaven? The gap between Earth Immortal and Loose Immortal isn’t something you can fathom.”
“Is that so?” Chen Ping’s lips curled into a cold arc, “Then I’d like to see just how impressive a First Grade Earth Immortal really is.”
Before his words fully landed, Chen Ping’s figure vanished. The old man’s pupils contracted, sensing a sharp killing intent rushing towards him. Instinctively, he summoned a black shield carved with countless resentful spirits, exuding an eerie aura.
“Clang!”
The Dragon-Slaying Sword clashed with the black shield, producing a piercing metallic ring.
The old man felt a tremendous force, his arm slightly numb. A jolt of shock hit him, realizing this Sixth Grade Loose Immortal human was no ordinary foe.
“Interesting, no wonder you’re so arrogant,” the old man grinned savagely, “But this ends here!”
His demonic energy surged wildly, the resentful spirits on the shield seeming to come alive, shrieking as they lunged at Chen Ping.
Simultaneously, his hands formed seals, muttering incantations. The ground split open, and countless black demonic vines shot out like venomous snakes, coiling towards Chen Ping.
“Parlour tricks,” Chen Ping snorted, his Heavenly Nether Eye fully activated, seeing through the old man’s attack patterns with perfect clarity.
His footwork shifted fluidly, weaving through the vines and spirits like a leisurely stroll. The Dragon-Slaying Sword danced, golden sword aura crisscrossing, shredding the spirits and vines to pieces.
“Impossible!” The old man’s grin froze, stunned that his attacks couldn’t even graze Chen Ping’s clothes.
“Nothing’s impossible,” Chen Ping’s voice seemed to echo from the depths, “You called humans lowly? Said the gap between Earth and Loose Immortals is insurmountable? Now, I’ll show you how laughable your so-called superiority is before me.”
As his words fell, Chen Ping’s aura surged, his Sixth Grade Loose Immortal cultivation showing faint signs of a breakthrough. He channelled all his power into the Dragon-Slaying Sword, its blade glowing with countless arcane runes, radiating a might that made the heavens tremble.
“Break!”
Chen Ping let out a low shout, the Dragon-Slaying Sword turning into a streak of light, slashing towards the old man at a speed barely discernible to the naked eye.
The strike appeared simple but carried the supreme, unyielding power to dispel illusions, sever delusions, and eradicate evil, the perfect counter to Demon Clan cultivators.
