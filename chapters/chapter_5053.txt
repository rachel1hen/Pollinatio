As Chen Ping pulled Mo Qingyun down from the stone platform, the runes on one of the coffins suddenly erupted with a terrifying force.
No one had time to react, and they were all blasted away by the force.
Fortunately, Chen Ping had the foresight to bring Mo Qingyun below the platform, so the force didn’t harm them.
But the others weren’t so lucky, their faces pale, blood trickling from their mouths.
Elder Tong, in particular, looked grim, his chest caved in.
Seeing Elder Tong’s state, Tianci lost his arrogant demeanour, replaced by a heavy expression.
He sensed this ruin wouldn’t yield its treasures so easily.
At that moment, the surrounding void was enveloped in an oppressive, fearful atmosphere.
Chen Ping looked at the platform, where the three coffins still stood intact, showing no signs of opening.
But where had that terrifying force come from?
Chen Ping pulled Mo Qingyun further back, sensing the eerie and terrifying nature of the three coffins.
“Creak, creak, creak…”
Suddenly, a piercing sound rang out as the middle coffin began to open on its own.
Seeing this, everyone tensed, their expressions wary and ready for action.
Chen Ping pulled Mo Qingyun behind him, gripping his Dragon-Slaying Sword, staring intently at the opening coffin.
Tianci, seeing Mo Qingyun and Chen Ping together again, looking so close, was furious but couldn’t confront Chen Ping now.
In the face of danger, they needed to work together.
Chen Ping glanced at the stone gate and whispered, “If things go wrong, run immediately, don’t linger to fight…”
“Got it!” Mo Qingyun nodded.
She would follow Chen Ping’s lead, running if he did.
“Boom—”
The middle coffin’s lid slowly opened, and an ancient, vast aura instantly filled the entire ruin!
Then, a shadowy figure emerged from the coffin, floating in mid-air.
It was a white-haired old man in an ancient robe, his eyes deep as the starry sky, as if he could see through everything.
“Finally… someone has come,” the old man said slowly, his voice aged yet majestic.
Everyone’s eyes widened, staring at the old man with greed in their gazes!
“Senior! I am Tianci of Tianyuan Pavilion, paying respects to you!” Tianci stepped forward, bowing respectfully.
“Baishuang of Shura Hall, greetings, Senior!” the white-robed woman quickly added.
“Tianyuan Pavilion, Shura Hall?” The old man shook his head. “Never heard of them…”
“May I ask which sect you belong to, Senior?” Chen Ping stepped forward and asked.
“Gantian Sect…” the old man said slowly.
“Gantian Sect?” Everyone was dumbfounded.
What sect was this?
Such a bold name?
But no one had ever heard of this sect or anyone mention it.
Seeing their reaction, the old man smiled faintly, “Our sect existed tens of thousands of years ago. It fell long ago, so it’s natural you young ones haven’t heard of it.”
“But the First, Second, and Third Heavens of the Celestial Realm were created by our Gantian Sect,” he added.
“What?” Everyone was utterly shocked.
“Senior, does your Gantian Sect’s name mean defying the heavens?” Chen Ping asked.
“Exactly, defying the heavens. Originally, the Celestial Realm had only thirty-three heavens.”
“Our Gantian Sect forcibly created three more heavens. Without us, cultivators below the Immortal Transformation stage who didn’t ascend would never have reached the Celestial Realm.”
“It was I who created these three heavens and set the rules: those with exceptional talent who pass the trials can be guided to the Celestial Realm,” the old man said slowly.
