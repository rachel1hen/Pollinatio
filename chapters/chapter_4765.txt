“Damn it…” Chen Ping couldn’t help but curse.
He hadn’t expected the Tenth Hall to have such a formidable figure.
Looking at the Tenth Hall Master before him, his body blood-red, his face twisted into a狰狞 expression, his aura both eerie and powerful.
Behind the Tenth Hall Master, only the Tenth Hall Master’s son and two other Tenth Hall cultivators remained, all severely injured.
Under normal circumstances, with a bit more effort, the rest of the Tenth Hall could have been wiped out.
But who could have guessed that the Tenth Hall Master could undergo beast transformation, and that the Tenth Hall had someone who could perform divine divination?
This was a miscalculation.
“Brother-in-law, maybe we should retreat. A true man knows when to bend and when to stand tall. Once we return to Sun and Moon City, I’ll gather another group of people,” Lin Kefan suggested to Chen Ping.
After throwing several punches without even grazing the opponent’s hair, Lin Kefan was feeling a bit intimidated.
Not to mention the Tenth Hall Master’s strength after his beast transformation, just the old man in front of them—even if they all attacked together, they might not be able to defeat him.
There was simply no chance of winning.
“Do you think we can still leave?” Chen Ping asked.
Lin Kefan was stunned and then fell silent.
“You think you can just leave?” the Tenth Hall Master sneered. “This Tenth Hall isn’t an inn where you can come and go as you please.”
“Huo Qing, no matter what your identity is, you’re still a member of the Tenth Hall. Are you just going to stand by and watch the Tenth Hall fall without lifting a finger?”
At this moment, Elder Qian spoke coldly toward the void.
As Elder Qian’s voice echoed, the void trembled, and Huo Qing, accompanied by the thin old man, slowly appeared.
Huo Qing might not care about the Tenth Hall Master’s authority, but when Elder Qian spoke, he didn’t dare not show himself.
Huo Qing had actually been observing from the shadows the entire time. Even as the Tenth Hall suffered heavy casualties, he hadn’t planned to intervene.
“Elder Qian, I just returned to the Tenth Hall. The Hall Master ordered me to kill Chen Ping for revenge, but I haven’t been able to find him.”
“Who would have thought this kid would dare to attack the Tenth Hall? He’s simply too arrogant!”
Huo Qing smiled obsequiously as he spoke to Elder Qian.
“Huo Qing, are you insulting me?” Elder Qian asked coldly.
“No, no, Elder Qian, how could you say that?”
Huo Qing waved his hands repeatedly.
“Have you forgotten what I do? How dare you lie to my face?” Elder Qian demanded sternly.
Huo Qing smiled awkwardly and said nothing.
His lies had been seen through by Elder Qian at a glance. How could someone who could divine the heavens be fooled by mere lies?
“Have your reinforcements arrived yet?”
Seeing Huo Qing’s silence, Elder Qian continued to ask.
“They’re on their way and will be here soon. I’ll handle these people myself. I won’t let a single one of them leave the Tenth Hall alive.”
Huo Qing quickly tried to curry favor.
“Put away your petty schemes and focus on training and growing. Otherwise, with a single word from me, your Huo family will never have a chance to enter the Divine Hall.”
Elder Qian warned Huo Qing.
“Elder Qian, you’re absolutely right. I won’t dare to do it again.”
Huo Qing nodded repeatedly, then turned his gaze to Chen Ping and the others, snorting coldly. “You bunch of trash, daring to attack the Tenth Hall? Watch how I destroy you!”
With that, Huo Qing raised his hand and threw a punch.
After all, Chen Ping and the others had just gone through a fierce battle and were all injured. Huo Qing, on the other hand, was fresh and ready for action.
“Huo Qing, with your meager skills, you dare to act so arrogantly!”
Cang Yue suddenly charged forward, also throwing a punch.
Both of them were at the peak of the ninth level of the Great Ascension Realm, so Cang Yue wasn’t afraid at all.
Boom!
A deafening explosion rang out, followed by a terrifying shockwave spreading in all directions.
Cang Yue’s body was sent flying but was caught steadily by Hua Yueying’s formation.
Huo Qing, on the other hand, only retreated a dozen steps. From this exchange, it was clear that Huo Qing had the slight upper hand.
But considering Cang Yue had been fighting for a long time, it was normal for him to be at a disadvantage.
