“I’m not going, my strength simply can’t hold up.”
Mad Immortal hurriedly waved his hand and stepped back.
Seeing this, Chen Ping paid him no further attention, instead closing his eyes slightly, his divine sense slowly reaching out towards the area ahead.
Uncertain of what lay within, Chen Ping didn’t dare to rush in recklessly.
As his divine sense gradually entered, his expression soon turned grave, for in that area, Chen Ping sensed many ferocious evil spirits, brimming with intense malevolence.
These evil spirits were clearly far more vicious than those outside, their hostility overwhelming.
Taking a deep breath, Chen Ping abruptly opened his eyes!
He knew that danger often meant opportunity. Having just broken through to the ninth rank of the Immortal Transformation Realm, if he could advance one more step, he could become a Loose Immortal.
That would make him a true immortal in the eyes of others.
Boom!
Chen Ping charged straight towards the area. In an instant, from the blood-sea-like region ahead, a golden pillar of light shot into the sky.
Chen Ping’s figure was instantly engulfed by the blood sea, surrounded by piercing wails that sounded as if they came from the depths of hell.
Seeing Chen Ping charge in without hesitation, Mad Immortal was filled with admiration.
“Kid, you’ve got some guts. If you die in there, don’t blame me…”
Mad Immortal muttered under his breath.
Soon, waves of terrifying aura spread outwards, forcing Mad Immortal to retreat further.
But before long, those auras were suppressed by golden light, gradually receding.
Mad Immortal’s expression turned to one of utter astonishment. He couldn’t believe that Chen Ping had managed to suppress such formidable evil spirits.
This was just too outrageous, wasn’t it?
Even if Chen Ping had the Golden Dragon bloodline, his cultivation was still only at the Immortal Transformation Realm.
Mad Immortal stared intently at the area, while City Lord Niu Meng, watching through a bronze mirror, observed nervously.
At this moment, he didn’t want Chen Ping to die in the Purgatory Field. If Chen Ping emerged alive, Niu Meng could find ways to get close to him, perhaps even recruit him for his own use.
He even considered using his daughter to seduce Chen Ping.
In that area, waves of terrifying malevolent energy erupted, shaking the surrounding space.
Feeling this fearsome energy, Mad Immortal was utterly shocked. He couldn’t fathom whether Chen Ping was still alive in that region.
With such malevolent energy, Mad Immortal knew he wouldn’t last a moment.
As waves of terrifying malevolent energy burst forth, they were soon overwhelmed by beams of golden light, the aura of Chen Ping’s bloodline.
At this moment, Chen Ping was frantically absorbing the malevolent energy.
“Absorbing like this, won’t he explode and die?”
Niu Meng frowned, clenching his fists, sweating for Chen Ping.
The evil spirits in this area were extremely malevolent. If one lost control and absorbed too much, it could corrupt the mind!
If Chen Ping absorbed too much and ended up possessed, becoming a killing machine, his bloodline, no matter how strong, would be useless.
Neither Mad Immortal nor Niu Meng could see what was happening in the area, nor did they know Chen Ping’s condition.
They could only sense waves of malevolent energy erupting, only to be suppressed by Chen Ping’s bloodline aura.
This continued for a day and a night…
Mad Immortal and Niu Meng, one on the scene and the other through the bronze mirror, watched unblinkingly for a day and a night.
Boom!
With a deafening roar, the entire area suddenly exploded, and the pervasive blood-sea aura began to dissipate.
Chen Ping stepped out slowly. At this moment, his entire body was enveloped in malevolent energy, an overwhelming intent to kill emanating from within.
Sensing this murderous intent, Mad Immortal grew frightened and kept his distance, fearing Chen Ping might suddenly turn on him.
