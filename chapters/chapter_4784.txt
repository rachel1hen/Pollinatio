“Then how does the Huo family survive in a place like that?”
Chen Ping asked curiously!
“They rely on the Heaven Ladder, the Huo family sends lots of their young’uns into it, the resources inside that world are plentiful.”
“Plus, they charge a toll for cultivators entering the Lawless Land, you’ve got to pass through there to reach the ladder, so the Huo family rakes in resources that way.”
The Tenth Hall Master explained!
“The Huo family’s got a knack for this game…”
Chen Ping gave a faint smile!
“Mr. Chen, if you’re thinking of popping into the Heaven Ladder for a lark, you’ll need to watch out for the Huo family, you killed Huo Ming, they won’t let that slide easy.”
The Tenth Hall Master cautioned!
“I get it, if the Huo family keeps coming at me, I don’t mind wiping them off the Celestial Human Realm map!”
Chen Ping grinned casually!
The Tenth Hall Master chuckled along, with Mr. Shi behind Chen Ping, forget one Huo family, ten wouldn’t stand a chance!
“Chen Ping, play it safe, that Tenth Hall kill order came from Huo Qing, if the Heaven Ladder does show up in the Lawless Land, the Huo family could easily slap another bounty on you.”
“Raise the stakes high enough, and some of those ladder-bound cultivators will bite, they’ll come for you, not everyone knows you’ve got a beast of a backer!”
Yun Li warned Chen Ping, urging him not to get too cocky!
“Got it!” Chen Ping nodded, “You two catch up, father and son, I won’t butt in, I’ve got to cultivate, see if I can bump my realm up a notch before the Heaven Ladder pops up…”
Chen Ping had taken all those storage pouches from the Tenth Hall Master, packed with resources!
With that haul, climbing one small realm shouldn’t be an issue!
…
Lawless Land, Huo Family!
Slap slap slap slap…
Huo Qing stood in the hall, getting a proper walloping from Huo Zhenfeng, the Huo family head!
Huo Qing stood stock-still, face full of fear!
“You bloody idiot, not training proper in the Tenth Hall, why’d you drag your big brother out?”
“Now he’s dead, and you’ve got the cheek to come back?”
Huo Zhenfeng roared, livid!
“Master, it’s not the Second Young Master’s fault, it’s that Chen Ping bloke, he targeted the Second Young Master, trashed the Tenth Hall, that’s why he called for backup.”
Steward Lu said cautiously!
“Shut it, you deserve a thrashing too, why’d you follow the Eldest Young Master out without telling me?”
Huo Zhenfeng glared at Steward Lu, fury blazing!
Steward Lu flinched, “Master, the Eldest Young Master forbade it, and we figured no cultivator in the Celestial Human Realm could touch us.”
“But who’d have thought, who’d have thought…”
Steward Lu stammered, how could a measly Mahayana Realm kid have such a powerhouse behind him!
“The Heaven Ladder’s about to show, all sorts of hidden factions are itching to move, and you lot still dare gallivant about?”
“Don’t you know there’s always a bigger fish, a taller sky?”
Huo Zhenfeng demanded!
“Father, we’ve got to avenge Big Brother, I don’t believe Chen Ping’ll stay holed up in the Xiao Dynasty forever!”
Huo Qing grit his teeth, itching to rally a posse for payback!
“You stay put, the Heaven Ladder’s coming soon, no more running amok, beef up the border patrols too.”
“This time, plenty of cultivators’ll come early to the Lawless Land, make sure to squeeze them for fees.”
“But play it smart, if they’re too strong, waive it, avoid a scrap!”
Huo Zhenfeng instructed Steward Lu!
“Understood, I’ll set it up!” Steward Lu nodded!
“Father, not avenging Big Brother, I can’t rest easy!”
Huo Qing gnashed his teeth!
“You’ve already put out a kill order on that Chen Ping, since ten thousand immortal spirit stones didn’t tempt anyone, bump it to twenty!”
“Remember, money moves mountains, the Heaven Ladder’s near, we’ll cash in big again!”
Huo Zhenfeng upped the bounty to twenty thousand immortal spirit stones to hunt Chen Ping!
