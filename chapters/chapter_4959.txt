“I reckon they’re after the Treasure Land. Rhino City has always controlled it, and Flying Tiger City isn’t happy about it,” Bai Yi said.
“Treasure Land?” Chen Ping was taken aback, his face full of confusion.
“Big brother, I’ll explain later. Let’s deal with these people first,” Niu Mang said, before his figure vanished in a flash, heading straight for the Western Region spies.
Seeing this, Chen Ping called out to Bai Yi and Mad Immortal, “Let’s get to work too. We can’t just eat and drink here for free!”
With that, Chen Ping gripped his Dragon-Slaying Sword and charged forward in an instant!
Boom, boom, boom…
As soon as Chen Ping struck, he unleashed three consecutive sword slashes!
These three slashes alone claimed the lives of three Western Region spies.
These spies were wearing the specially crafted armour of the Battle Soldier Team, which was not only incredibly tough but also soaked in turtle blood.
Yet, with a single move, Chen Ping sliced through the armour and killed them, leaving the remaining spies utterly shocked!
They were already outnumbered, and now, facing a master like Chen Ping, their fighting spirit vanished instantly!
“Courting death…” the shopkeeper of Tianbao Pavilion growled, slashing at Chen Ping with a single stroke.
A blood-red long blade soared into the air, carrying an aura of endless death as it descended.
Seeing this, Chen Ping swung his Dragon-Slaying Sword to parry the blow.
“Damn it, you dare attack my big brother…” Mad Immortal roared, furious at the assault on Chen Ping. He instantly positioned himself in front of Chen Ping, thrusting both palms forward.
As Mad Immortal struck, two crimson flames erupted from his palms, colliding with the shopkeeper’s blood-red blade in a deafening explosion.
Amid the blast, the blood-red blade shattered inch by inch. The shopkeeper of Tianbao Pavilion was sent flying like a broken kite, crashing heavily into a corridor pillar. His helmet fell off, and a mouthful of blood sprayed out, staining the Battle Soldier armour on his chest.
“This… how is this possible…” the shopkeeper of Tianbao Pavilion stared at Mad Immortal in horror, his eyes filled with disbelief.
“You… you’re Mad Immortal?” the shopkeeper said, his face full of shock. Mad Immortal had been in the Purgatory Arena for centuries, presumed dead, yet here he was today.
What shocked the shopkeeper even more was that Mad Immortal was calling Chen Ping “big brother”?
He didn’t know Chen Ping’s identity, but since the token had come from Chen Ping’s hands, it was clear Chen Ping had a significant connection to the City Lord’s Mansion. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have had the token!
“It’s you?” Chen Ping exclaimed, stunned upon seeing the shopkeeper.
Niu Mang approached as well, and upon recognising the man’s face, his pupils contracted sharply, his expression one of shock.
“It’s actually you, Li Tianbao!” Niu Mang’s voice was filled with anger and disappointment. “I trusted you so much, entrusting Tianbao Pavilion to your care, and yet you’re a spy for Flying Tiger City!”
Li Tianbao struggled to his feet, wiping the blood from his mouth and sneering, “Niu Mang, don’t be so naive. In this dog-eat-dog world, who doesn’t want more resources? Rhino City monopolises the Treasure Land and hoards resources. Naturally, Flying Tiger City won’t stand idly by.”
“Silence!” Niu Mang roared, his aura surging violently. “Today, none of you will leave here alive!”
With that, Niu Mang’s hands formed a seal, and the formation above the City Lord’s Mansion blazed with light. Chains emerged from the void, shooting towards the remaining Flying Tiger City spies.
As the fierce battle raged, a sudden cry rang out from the distance.
“Let me go!”
Niu Ben was being dragged out of a room, held hostage by a Flying Tiger City spy, whose hand was pressed against Niu Ben’s throat. One wrong move, and Niu Ben’s life would be forfeit.
“Father! Save me!” Niu Ben cried out in terror.
Niu Mang froze, a flash of panic in his eyes.
“If you harm a single hair on my son’s head, I’ll make you wish you were dead!” Niu Mang bellowed, his eyes blazing with fury, his killing intent boiling over.
