Boom!
With a tremendous explosion, the fist imprint instantly smashed the dozen soldiers into the ground.
A hundred-meter-deep crater appeared, and the soldiers’ bodies were nowhere to be seen.
As if vaporized, they didn’t even have time to react.
The scene of this punch was utterly shocking.
Even Mad Immortal and Bai Yi, who had already finished their fight, couldn’t help but gasp at the sight.
Prince Huo’s eyes were wide, his gaze now vacant.
In the face of absolute power, his God Clan pride had vanished completely.
Chen Ping hadn’t even moved, just casually thrown a single punch.
And just like that, a dozen soldiers were gone, not even their bodies remained.
Was this really something a cultivator who had just stepped into the Loose Immortal Realm could achieve?
“Impossible, how is this possible?” Prince Huo muttered, unable to believe that Chen Ping, a mere first-grade Loose Immortal, could possess such strength.
“Behave yourself, and I might spare you, otherwise, no one can save you.”
“I’d kill anyone I want, even a Saint from the Thirty-Six Heavens, I’d take them down…” Chen Ping said, brimming with bravado!
When it came to showing off, Chen Ping wasn’t intimidated by these God Clan folks.
But just as he finished speaking, a thunderclap exploded in the sky.
Rumble…
The thunder made Chen Ping’s heart tremble, an inexplicable jolt running through his body.
“Bloody hell, does bragging in the Celestial Realm get you struck by lightning?” Chen Ping cursed under his breath.
“Big Brother, you can show off, but don’t joke about Saints, it could really get you killed,” Mad Immortal quickly warned Chen Ping.
Chen Ping looked embarrassed, he hadn’t expected Saints to be so petty!
It was just a joke!
“So, what do you say? Will you cooperate and escort us out of Flying Tiger City?” Chen Ping asked Prince Huo with a playful smirk.
Snapped back to reality, Prince Huo looked at Chen Ping as if he were a demon.
His heart pounded, nearly scared to death.
At this moment, he had none of the Eighth Hall Prince’s former grandeur.
“I… I…” Prince Huo hesitated, then suddenly shouted into the air, “Father, save me…”
Chen Ping looked up, thinking Huo Zhao had arrived!
But there was nothing, and Prince Huo seized the chance to turn and flee.
“Damn it, calling for your dad won’t help!” Chen Ping grabbed the escaping Prince Huo!
“Father, Father…” Prince Huo struggled, shouting desperately!
Slap, slap, slap…
Chen Ping delivered a flurry of slaps to Prince Huo’s face.
He aimed to strip away the last shred of dignity Prince Huo had.
Only then would Prince Huo obey completely.
“If you don’t behave, believe me, I’ll cut out your tongue for shouting,” Chen Ping growled!
Prince Huo’s face flushed red, if this guy wasn’t still useful, Chen Ping would’ve already smashed his head with a single slap.
This time, Prince Huo was truly terrified, no longer daring to shout.
His heart was filled with fear, and thoughts of escape had vanished.
“Don’t, don’t, I’ll cooperate, I’ll cooperate!” Prince Huo began to plead.
“That’s more like it, as long as you behave, we’ll let you go once we leave Flying Tiger City,” Chen Ping started painting a rosy picture for him.
Of course, once Chen Ping and his group were truly safe, there was no way they’d let this guy go.
Chen Ping wasn’t foolish enough to release a tiger back into the wild, he wasn’t some saintly fool.
Since they were already mortal enemies with the Temple, there was no way he’d let an enemy go free.
When the time came, he’d strip Prince Huo of anything valuable and send him to the underworld.
But to ensure Prince Huo obediently escorted them out, Chen Ping had to keep him calm for now, lest he tried something desperate like a last-ditch fight.
“I’ll behave, I’ll definitely behave!” Prince Huo nodded repeatedly.
