However, just as his divine sense touched the edge of a black palace in the valley, a sharp killing intent suddenly locked onto him!
“Someone’s spying!” A stern shout came from the valley, followed by several powerful auras soaring into the sky, moving at an astonishing speed, heading straight for their hiding place!
“Not good, we’ve been spotted!”
Chen Ping’s face changed, he quickly withdrew his divine sense, grabbed Hu Mazi, and ran, “Quick, retreat!”
Almost the moment they moved, several dark demonic lights struck the ravine where they had been hiding, shattering boulders and stirring up clouds of dust.
“Catch them!”
“Daring to spy outside Black Wind Valley, courting death!”
Dozens of demonic cultivators swarmed out of the valley, led by a fifth-grade Earth Immortal demonic cultivator with a ferocious face, moving so fast that he closed the distance to them in an instant.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi didn’t dare pause for a moment, pushing their speed to the limit, sprinting towards Sword Saint City.
The demonic cultivators behind them pursued relentlessly, hurling all sorts of vicious spells and hidden weapons, forcing them into constant peril.
“This bunch of bastards, they’re fast!”
Hu Mazi dodged while cursing angrily, throwing back a few talismans that exploded in a burst of flames, slightly slowing the pursuers.
Chen Ping, meanwhile, focused entirely on sensing the auras behind them, constantly adjusting their direction, using the terrain to evade attacks.
He secretly rejoiced in his heart, thankful they hadn’t rashly charged in earlier, or they would already be surrounded, with no hope of escape.
The two fled frantically, relying on their familiarity with the direction of Sword Saint City and Chen Ping’s precise evasions at critical moments, finally managing to rush through the gates of Sword Saint City, battered and lightly injured.
The demonic cultivators chased them to the vicinity of the city gates but seemed wary, not daring to enter Sword Saint City’s territory, only shouting curses from outside before reluctantly leaving.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi leaned against the city wall, panting heavily, soaked in sweat, their faces still showing traces of lingering fear.
“Damn it, we almost died back there.”
Hu Mazi wiped the dirt from his face, speaking with lingering dread.
At that moment, a familiar figure approached quickly, it was Ling Xue.
Seeing their dishevelled state, she was startled, “Senior Brother Chen, Master Hu, how did you end up like this?”
Chen Ping caught his breath and briefly recounted what had happened.
Ling Xue’s expression shifted slightly upon hearing, “You’re safe, that’s what matters. Come with me, Master wishes to see you.”
The two followed Ling Xue back to Mo Chen’s courtyard.
Mo Chen was sitting at a stone table, sipping tea. Seeing them enter, he set down his cup, his gaze sweeping over them, and said calmly, “It seems you went to Black Wind Valley?”
“Yes, Senior.”
Chen Ping bowed, “But something about Black Wind Valley seemed off.”
He shared his findings, including how the demonic cultivators’ aura differed from the Evil Path Hall and how they were chased after being discovered, recounting everything to Mo Chen.
Mo Chen nodded after listening, “As expected, Black Wind Valley could never be a branch of the Evil Path Hall.”
“Why not?” Chen Ping asked.
“The demonic cultivators in Black Wind Valley belong to the Blood Demon lineage. Their cultivation method involves absorbing the blood of other cultivators to enhance their power, a brutal technique, but completely different from the Evil Path Hall’s focus on refining souls.”
Mo Chen explained, “Moreover, the Blood Demon lineage is violent and vengeful. You were lucky to escape their grasp. If you had actually entered, you likely wouldn’t have made it out.”
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi exchanged a glance, both feeling a chill, but also a surge of anger.
“So, we were tricked by that information tower?”
Hu Mazi said furiously, “One million immortal stones, just for fake news?”
