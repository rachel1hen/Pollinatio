But now, Chen Ping was nearly invincible below the Third Heaven.
If he advanced one more realm, he could sweep through the Third Heaven.
Monks who broke through to the Loose Immortal Realm all rushed past the Third Heaven’s barrier to the Fourth Heaven.
After all, only those in the Fourth Heaven could be considered true immortals.
“Senior, I wonder if you can show yourself in this tower. How about we spar a bit?”
“I’m feeling full of energy and want to test it out,” Chen Ping said to the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord.
“What? You want to spar with me?” The Crimson Cloud Demon Lord sneered.
“I just want to try. You’re only a soul body now, so it should be fine,” Chen Ping replied.
“Tch, just reaching Fourth-grade Loose Immortal Realm has made you so arrogant, and you want to test me?”
“If I said I could defeat you with one hand, it’d seem like I lack compassion. But let me tell you, I could blow you to ashes with a single breath.”
“In my eyes, even at Fourth-grade Loose Immortal Realm, you’re still an ant. I could drown you with a single piss.”
“I advise you to keep a low profile. This is the Heavenly Realm. Below the Third Heaven, you’re fine, but once you break through to the Fourth Heaven, you never know when you’ll meet a true expert.”
“If you keep acting cocky like this, someone could spit you to death.”
Chen Ping: “…”
He had only wanted to spar a few rounds with the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord in the tower to test his strength.
But instead, he got a scolding that completely deflated him.
Still, the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord was right. Chen Ping’s current strength was enough to get by in the Third Heaven, but in the Fourth Heaven, facing the entire Heavenly Realm, it was far from sufficient.
“Qingyun, let’s go…”
Chen Ping ignored the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord and turned to Mo Qingyun.
Mo Qingyun nodded and followed Chen Ping out of the Demon-Suppressing Tower.
Though only a few hours had passed outside, it had been over ten days inside the tower, which explained Chen Ping’s rapid breakthrough.
“Where to?” Mo Qingyun asked.
“Let’s go home first…” Chen Ping decided to return to the Mo family.
He planned to let Mo Qingyun stay with Mo Wuji for a while before taking her to the Eight Halls.
But as soon as Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun arrived at the Mo family, they noticed a black-robed elder hovering above.
Mo Wuji was leading the Mo family in a standoff against the elder.
The black-robed elder was at the Eighth-grade Loose Immortal Realm, far beyond the Mo family’s strength, yet neither side had made a move.
The elder simply lingered silently in the void.
“Father, who is this?” Mo Qingyun asked, approaching Mo Wuji.
Mo Wuji shook his head, “I don’t know, but he’s looking for an explanation.”
“Looking for me?” Chen Ping frowned and addressed the elder, “Who are you, and what do you want with me?”
“You’re Chen Pingyuan?” the elder asked.
“Yes, that’s me,” Chen Ping nodded.
“Do you have a treasure from the ancient ruins?” the black-robed elder inquired.
Chen Ping’s eyes narrowed as he assessed the elder, “What’s it to you?”
It was obvious the elder had ill intentions.
“Insolent!” The elder’s brow furrowed, and his body suddenly became ethereal. Countless chains materialized around Chen Ping, binding him in an instant.
At the same time, bolts of dark lightning surged through the chains, striking at Chen Ping.
“Chen Ping!”
Mo Qingyun and Mo Wuji gasped in shock.
They hadn’t expected the black-robed elder to attack so abruptly.
But just as the lightning hit Chen Ping, a deafening explosion erupted.
A golden sword light burst through the dark lightning and shot toward the elder.
The elder’s eyes narrowed, surprised that Chen Ping could still resist. With a wave of his hand, a black beam met the attack.
Boom!
With a loud blast, both fighters were pushed back.
