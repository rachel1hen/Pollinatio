“Why is it impossible?”
The Great Elder gave a bitter laugh, “Do you think your father is some saint? He tore us apart and handed the management of Shura Hall to you, a woman. He knew all along that Sang Qi was my son, yet he never mentioned it.”
“He wanted me to watch my own son be looked down upon in Shura Hall, to watch my son call him father.”
“Now my son is dead, and he doesn’t even blink, ready to let the murderer walk free!”
The Great Elder seemed to descend into madness!
“Great Elder, wasn’t my son also killed by Chen Ping? Yet I’m not seeking revenge. Sang Kun wasn’t your son!”
Sang Tianyang said to the Great Elder!
But the Great Elder gave a helpless smile, “You have many children, but I had only this one son.”
“And I swore never to take another woman. All my hopes were pinned on Sang Qi.”
“But now…”
The Great Elder suddenly turned to Chen Ping, his gaze turning ferocious, “But you, Chen Ping! You killed him! You not only killed my son but destroyed half a lifetime of my hopes!”
Chen Ping looked helpless. How could he have known this? He was even less aware of such messy affairs within Shura Hall.
It seemed that even in the Heavenly Realm, becoming an immortal couldn’t escape emotional entanglements or worldly matters!
The Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion, fanning his jade fan, smirked slyly, “What a tale of old grudges.”
“Great Elder, if you join forces with me, why suffer such humiliation? First, kill this Chen Ping, and I’ll help you seize Shura Hall. Then you’ll be its Master.”
With that, the elders behind him stepped forward, their auras erupting, the air crackling with energy.
“Sang Tianyang,” the Pavilion Master looked at the ashen-faced Sang Tianyang, “Today, Tianyuan Pavilion won’t trouble your Shura Hall. We only seek justice for our fallen prodigy and elder.”
“If you insist on protecting Chen Ping, you’ll be making an enemy of Tianyuan Pavilion, and I’ll kill you along with him!”
Before his words faded, the Tianyuan Pavilion elders fanned out, their jade fans conjuring sharp wind blades aimed at Chen Ping and Sang Tianyang.
The Great Elder roared, standing beside the Pavilion Master with his blade raised, a blood-red Shura phantom rising from it, clearly ready for a fight to the death.
“Outrageous!”
Sang Tianyang stepped forward, purple-gold energy exploding like a tsunami, the glazed tiles on the ground cracking inch by inch.
With a wave of his sleeve, a dragon-shaped energy blast shot toward Ling Yunxiao, only to be effortlessly blocked by the latter’s jade fan.
“Does Tianyuan Pavilion think Shura Hall has no one left?”
“Father, don’t push yourself!” Sang Lan shouted anxiously, “They have too many people!”
She knew that just she and her father couldn’t possibly stand against so many from Tianyuan Pavilion!
Especially now that the Great Elder had betrayed them, siding with Tianyuan Pavilion.
The Pavilion Master sneered, “Sang Tianyang, you’ve been in seclusion for years. Shura Hall is no longer what it once was.”
“Today, I’ll show you who truly rules the Second Heaven!”
The elders behind him acted in unison, their multicoloured energy beams weaving into a net, enveloping Sang Tianyang and Chen Ping.
The Great Elder’s blade light shot straight for Chen Ping’s heart, his eyes filled with unmasked killing intent, “Chen Ping, your life ends here!”
As the net was about to descend, Sang Tianyang let out a roar that shook the heavens.
The Shura jade pendant on his chest suddenly erupted in blinding golden light, his aura surging at a terrifying speed, countless Shura ghost shadows faintly emerging within the purple-gold energy.
“Shura Secret Art, Shura Divine Technique!”
He clasped his palms together, and behind him, a massive phantom of Shura Hall appeared. Its gates slowly opened, releasing a chilling, bone-piercing aura.
