Chen Ping gritted his teeth, a flash of determination in his eyes.
He pulled out the Demon-Whipping Lash from his robes, a weapon specifically designed to counter demonic cultivators.
The lash whipped through the air, cracking loudly, its tip tearing through the demons’ bodies, sending blood splattering.
However, the demon leader remained unaffected, charging at Chen Ping and Gadfly with its battle-axe raised.
Demons were somewhat different from demonic cultivators, so the lash’s power was significantly reduced.
Chen Ping steeled himself and took out the God-King Bow.
The God-King Bow, an ancient divine artefact, was immensely powerful but required vast amounts of dao-patterned malevolent energy to use.
Chen Ping channelled the malevolent energy into the bow, and soon an arrow formed, its shaft gleaming with dazzling light.
“Die!” Chen Ping roared, releasing the bowstring, the arrow shooting like a golden bolt of lightning towards the demon leader.
Sensing the arrow’s threat, the demon leader swung its axe to block it.
But the arrow’s power was overwhelming, piercing through the axe and lodging in the demon leader’s shoulder.
The demon leader let out a pained roar, its body trembling violently, black blood gushing from the wound.
Yet it didn’t fall, instead attacking Chen Ping and Gadfly with even greater ferocity.
Chen Ping knew this was a life-or-death moment, he had to give his all.
“Come forth…” Chen Ping summoned the Fire Qilin.
As the Fire Qilin appeared, the surrounding temperature soared, it let out a sky-shaking roar and charged at the demon leader.
Blazing flames enveloped the Fire Qilin’s body, igniting the air wherever it went.
It clashed with the demon leader, flames and dark energy colliding in explosive bursts.
Seizing the moment, Chen Ping raised the God-King Bow again, nocking an arrow and aiming at the demon leader’s heart.
“Die!” Chen Ping shouted, pouring all his strength into the shot.
The arrow, carrying world-shattering force, rocketed towards the demon leader.
The demon leader tried to dodge but was pinned down by the Fire Qilin, unable to move, the arrow struck true, piercing its heart, the demon leader let out an earth-shaking roar before collapsing.
With the demon leader dead, the other demons lost their will to fight and tried to flee.
Chen Ping and Gadfly gave no quarter, pursuing and slaying the remaining demons.
“Big Brother, you’re incredible, I’m in absolute awe, you’ve got so many treasures, and even a divine beast!” Gadfly exclaimed, staring at the flame-wreathed Qilin, “That’s a Fire Qilin, right? A mount for celestial immortals, isn’t it?”
“I don’t know, my Fire Qilin is still young, it needs time to grow into its full power,” Chen Ping said, shaking his head.
He had no idea what level of immortal’s mount the Fire Qilin was.
“Big Brother, with all these immortal stones, should I go back and call people to mine them?” Gadfly asked, eyeing the endless vein of immortal stones.
“No, this treasure trove must stay between us, no one else can know,” Chen Ping replied.
He didn’t want others to learn of the immortal stone vein in this treasure trove.
Once they harvested the vein, others would still covet the place.
Then Gadfly could use the now-worthless treasure trove to scam resources from others.
“I understand!” Gadfly nodded.
Chen Ping looked at the immortal stone vein, neither storage bags nor rings could hold it all.
But leaving the vein here made him uneasy.
