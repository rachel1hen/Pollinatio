This golden light was like a sharp sword, instantly piercing through the bodies of the five elders.
Although the five elders did not die, each of them was severely injured and their arms and legs were broken!
Seeing Chen Ping’s strength, the five severely injured elders did not dare to speak, and after glaring at Chen Ping viciously, they quickly left with each other’s help!
“Mr. Chen, thank you for saving my life ……”
Jiang Wei and the others came forward and hurriedly followed Chen Ping to say thanks.
“Brother Jiang, it was just a hand up, you should leave here quickly, don’t come here in the future, this is not a place for you to stay!”
Chen Ping told Jiang Wei and the others to leave quickly, after all, all of them were hidden sects, the difference in strength was too great, Jiang Wei and the otherworldly martial artists would only be sent to their deaths if they came here!
Even if Chen Ping didn’t say anything, they wouldn’t dare to come here again!
After Jiang Wei and the others left, Chen Ping took Liu Rui and rushed back to the Pure Yang Clan, as he had to save Hu Ma Zi and Long Xing Xu as soon as possible.
When he returned to the Pure Yang Clan, Chen Ping took out the Spiritual Fruits and gave one to Hu Ma Zi and one to Long Xing Xu and swallowed them.
After swallowing the Spiritual Fruits, the bodies of Hu Ma Zi and Long Xing Xu shone brightly, and after only a few moments, the bones and veins of their bodies were restored!
“Chen Ping, what is that thing you gave us to eat? How come it’s so miraculous?”
“I always feel like there’s a force swimming around inside me.”
Hu Ma Zi immediately jumped up from the bed and asked Chen Ping with some curiosity.
“Brother Chen Ping, I also feel a manic power inside me, as if my body is about to explode.”
Long Xingxu said at this moment, with some pain on his face!
