The Seventh Floor was a starry expanse, devoid of any breath, let alone living creatures!
There was only a man dressed in a long robe, holding a staff!
The Seventh Floor, a height that cultivators from the Celestial Realm had never reached!
Chen Ping had no idea how much power this man with a staff, who seemed like a cripple, actually possessed!
“Senior, do we still need to compete to pass this level?”
Chen Ping asked!
“No need, you just have to go from here to the Eighth Floor. I’m standing here merely out of curiosity, to see what kind of person could make the master of the Heavenly Ladder show such blatant favouritism!”
“But looking at you, you seem to be only at the Mahayana Realm, nothing particularly remarkable about you…”
The man asked with some curiosity!
“Senior, I don’t have much skill, but I have a powerful figure backing me. It’s probably that Golden Immortal of the Heavenly Ladder who fears the one behind me!”
Chen Ping said calmly!
“Perhaps so, you may go up now!”
The man stepped aside, allowing Chen Ping and his group to ascend to the Eighth Floor!
Just as Chen Ping was about to lead Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi up to the Eighth Floor, he suddenly stopped!
The man frowned slightly, puzzled, “Young Master Chen, is there something else?”
“Senior, it seems you’ve forgotten something, haven’t you?”
Chen Ping said!
“Forgotten what?” The man looked utterly confused!
“Senior, it seems you forgot to give me a gift!” Chen Ping replied!
“A gift?” The man was taken aback!
“Senior, if it weren’t for me, I’m afraid you wouldn’t have escaped this Heavenly Ladder so easily, would you?” Chen Ping said!
The man: “…”
Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi watched Chen Ping, utterly speechless!
Others begged the guardians of the Heavenly Ladder for leniency to climb higher!
But Chen Ping? He went straight to extorting the guardians of the Heavenly Ladder!
“I’ve been trapped here for years, so I don’t have many resources on me…”
The man took out a storage pouch and handed it to Chen Ping!
Chen Ping didn’t even glance at it before pocketing it and ascending to the Eighth Floor!
However, when Chen Ping arrived at the Eighth Floor, he found it shrouded in chaos, not only lacking a world but also devoid of a guardian!
“What’s going on here?” Ning Zhi was somewhat surprised!
Chen Ping didn’t understand either, why was there no guardian on the Eighth Floor?
Just as they stood there, perplexed, a heavenly ladder appeared, guiding them towards the Ninth Floor!
“We’ve passed the Eighth Floor just like that?”
Chen Ping felt a bit disappointed!
“Isn’t it better that there’s no one?” Ning Zhi said!
“I was hoping to get some resources from the Eighth Floor’s guardian!” Chen Ping replied!
Ning Zhi was left speechless!
Since there was no one, Chen Ping could only lead Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi towards the Ninth Floor!
The Ninth Floor was bathed in a soft glow, making one feel incredibly at ease!
A boy who looked no older than a teenager, dressed in a yellow robe, stood quietly waiting for Chen Ping and his group!
Chen Ping looked at the boy, knowing full well that the person before him couldn’t possibly be a child!
Even with a youthful appearance, he had likely lived for thousands of years!
“Senior, I’d like to ask, where did the guardian of the Eighth Floor go?”
Chen Ping asked the boy!
“He ran off, afraid you’d demand resources from him,” the boy said!
Chen Ping immediately felt awkward but still looked at the boy curiously, “Then why didn’t you run?”
“If I ran, you’d never pass the Heavenly Ladder, nor would you ever reach the Celestial Realm.”
After speaking, the boy summoned a gentle beam of white light, “Pass through this guiding path, and you’ll reach the Celestial Realm. However, I’m only responsible for guiding you, as for what dangers you might encounter in the Celestial Realm, that’s not my concern!”
Looking at that beam of white light, Ning Zhi was beyond excited, “Can we go too?”
“Of course, you’re Young Master Chen’s friends, so naturally you can. However, with your current strength, surviving in the Celestial Realm might prove quite difficult!”
The boy spoke truthfully!
