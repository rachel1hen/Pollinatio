Chen Ping’s divine sense infiltrated the restrictions beneath the floor tiles of the Barbarian King Hall like a spider’s web, finally locking onto a mysterious yellow stone wall behind the central throne.
The stone wall appeared ordinary, yet it shimmered with the rugged runes unique to the ancient Barbarian Clan, each line exuding a bloodthirsty and ancient pressure.
He flicked his finger, and a wisp of chaotic sword qi burst from his fingertip, precisely striking the node of the runes on the stone wall.
“Rumble…”
The stone wall split open, revealing a pitch-black passage.
The passage was shrouded in darkness, with only a faint golden glow flickering at its end, accompanied by an overwhelmingly dense spiritual qi and… a subtle, almost imperceptible fluctuation of divine soul energy.
Chen Ping’s eyes narrowed as he stepped into the passage. The moment his foot touched the ground, thousands of bone lamps suddenly lit up around him, illuminating a circular treasury with a hundred-zhang-high dome.
The sight within the treasury was breathtaking: the walls were embedded with radiant immortal crystals, illuminating the space as bright as day;
A jade platform in the centre was piled with a mountain of immortal stones, the spiritual qi so dense it nearly solidified;
Countless jade boxes and beast hide scrolls were scattered about, and a few spiritual herbs radiating chaotic aura caused Chen Ping’s sea of consciousness to tremble slightly.
But what truly made his pupils contract was a golden divine soul suspended in the deepest part of the treasury.
The divine soul stood about three zhang tall, clad in beast-bone battle armour, its face blurred yet exuding an aura of domineering supremacy. It was surrounded by illusory totems unique to the Barbarian Clan, each pattern seemingly imbued with the laws of the world’s creation.
“Intruder, daring to trespass in the Barbarian Ancestral Land, you court death!”
The divine soul spoke, its voice like the roar of ten thousand beasts, causing the entire treasury to hum with resonance.
Chen Ping felt an overwhelming pressure surge towards him, far surpassing the Grand Elder’s by a hundredfold, faintly touching the threshold of the Quasi-Saint Realm.
He instantly activated his time origin, his domain erupting to suppress the opponent.
However, the divine soul merely sneered, waving its sleeve. A solid, iron-like golden wave of energy crashed into Chen Ping’s domain.
With a “crack,” the time domain shattered like glass. Chen Ping felt a tightness in his chest, forced back three steps, a trickle of blood escaping his lips.
“A mere embryonic time origin, and you dare show off before me?”
The divine soul phantom stepped through the air, its five fingers forming a claw that tore towards Chen Ping’s throat with space-rending force. “Considering your cultivation wasn’t easy, cripple yourself, and I’ll spare your corpse.”
Chen Ping’s gaze turned icy. The chaotic true qi in his body surged wildly as he summoned the Immortal-Slaying Flying Blade, which shot towards the divine soul’s brow as a streak of azure light.
But the divine soul merely pointed a finger, sending the blade flying back with a faint crack appearing on its surface.
“Impossible…”
Chen Ping’s heart shook with shock.
This divine soul’s strength far exceeded his expectations. For a mere remnant soul to possess such power, what kind of existence was the Barbarian Clan’s ancestor?
He unleashed several divine abilities in succession, even activating the Chaos Pearl in his sea of consciousness, but the divine soul stood like an eternal divine mountain, unmoved, each counterattack pushing Chen Ping to the brink.
As the divine soul’s attacks grew fiercer and Chen Ping’s true qi neared depletion, he gritted his teeth and sank his mind into his sea of consciousness. “Senior, it’s your turn!”
“Hahaha… letting this old man possess you again?”
The Red Cloud Demon Lord laughed.
“No, this guy’s a divine soul. You can come out directly,” Chen Ping said.
The Red Cloud Demon Lord, also in a divine soul state, was perfect for dealing with this opponent!
The seal in his sea of consciousness shattered with a boom, and a dark red figure shrouded in monstrous demonic qi soared out—the Red Cloud Demon Lord, who had resided in Chen Ping’s sea of consciousness for so long.
The moment he appeared, he transformed into a streak of light, charging into the treasury straight towards the golden divine soul.
“Where did this old fossil come from, daring to touch my guy?”
The Red Cloud Demon Lord’s form expanded, becoming a thousand-zhang-tall demonic shadow. Pointing at the divine soul’s nose, he cursed, “Look at you, neither human nor ghost. Been dead for tens of thousands of years with no one burning paper money for you? So poor you’re just a pile of bones, huh?”
