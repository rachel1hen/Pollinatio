“Hmph, this bloke’s got the nerve to show up again, perfect, let’s have a go at him…”
Xuan Bin flared up the moment he heard it!
Fresh off their breakthrough, the three of them, now at Immortal Transformation Realm, could tangle with the Tenth Hall Master together!
“What’s he back for?”
Chen Ping frowned, he’d promised Yun Li not to kill the Tenth Hall Master, and now this guy dared to return!
Hadn’t he seen how Huo Ming died?
“Leave it be, focus on your training, I’ll deal with this Tenth Hall Master!”
Chen Ping worried that if Xuan Bin and the others clashed with him and accidentally killed him, he’d have no way to explain it to Yun Li!
He followed Xiao Yuanshan to the Xiao Dynasty’s border, the Tenth Hall Master not daring to step in casually.
Seeing Chen Ping arrive, the Tenth Hall Master moved forward, then hesitated, too wary to cross into Xiao Dynasty territory!
“What’re you here for now?”
Chen Ping asked the Tenth Hall Master!
“Mr. Chen, I’ve come specially to apologise to you!” The Tenth Hall Master bowed respectfully!
Chen Ping blinked, staring at him in confusion, what was this guy playing at?
Even with Huo Ming chopped down, it shouldn’t have spooked the Tenth Hall Master this bad, coming to grovel like this?
Outside the Xiao Dynasty, Chen Ping’s crew still couldn’t match the Tenth Hall head-on!
“What’s your game? Spit it out quick, if you’re here to kill me, I’m ready any time, no need for tricks!”
Chen Ping figured the Tenth Hall Master might be luring him out of the dynasty!
“Mr. Chen, I’m genuinely here to apologise, I hope you can forgive me!”
The Tenth Hall Master said with earnest sincerity!
“Mr. Chen, don’t trust this git too easy!” Xiao Yuanshan warned from the side!
Seeing this, the Tenth Hall Master tossed all the collected storage pouches in front of Chen Ping, “These are all the resources I gathered from the Tenth Hall, a tribute to you, Mr. Chen!”
“I beg your mercy to spare me, I’m willing to follow you…”
Chen Ping eyed the pouches, stunned, especially when he spotted one with a unique mark, he picked it up for a closer look!
Inside, he found twenty thousand immortal spirit stones, plus a heap of other resources too many to count!
“Bloody hell…” Chen Ping stood there, gobsmacked!
“This is the Ninth Hall Master’s pouch, he had more resources, all offered to you, Mr. Chen…”
The Tenth Hall Master hurriedly explained!
“Ninth Hall Master?” Chen Ping froze, “You killed him?”
If the Ninth Hall Master were alive, no way he’d hand over his pouch!
“No, no, no, I haven’t got the chops to kill him, it was the powerhouse behind you, Mr. Chen!”
The Tenth Hall Master waved his hands frantically!
“You mean Mr. Shi?” Chen Ping’s face lit with surprise!
“Yes, yes, yes, that Mr. Shi, but not his real self, just a shadow, killed the Ninth Hall Master and left!”
The Tenth Hall Master said!
Chen Ping puzzled over it, Mr. Shi had said he’d stop killing enemies for him, told Chen Ping to handle it himself!
So why’d he start taking out Divine Hall folks again?
And the Ninth Hall Master, stronger than the Tenth, wiped out by a shadow!
“Here in the Celestial Human Realm, aside from your Tenth Hall and the Ninth, are there other Divine Hall branches?”
Chen Ping asked!
The Tenth Hall Master shook his head, “I don’t know, the ten halls of the Divine Hall, where they are, who runs them, I’ve got no clue.”
“To be honest, Mr. Chen, I’ve never even seen our Divine Hall’s Lord.”
“But the Ninth Hall Master said he’d climbed to the eighth level of the Heaven Ladder, so he must’ve been in the Celestial Human Realm, probably hung around the Heaven Ladder world a lot.”
The Tenth Hall Master’s words, struck Chen Ping as somewhat believable.
