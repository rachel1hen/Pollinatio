He leapt onto the first stone, which was as steady as a rock, the runes’ power shielding him from the scorching heat.
“Follow me, step by step, don’t fall into the lava.”
Hu Mazi took a deep breath, carefully stepping onto the stones as Chen Ping had done, moving forward cautiously.
From below the lava pool came roars, as if something was writhing in the molten rock, sending chills down their spines.
Just as they neared the opposite shore, a massive wave surged from the lava pool. A monster covered in black scales burst out, its gaping maw lunging towards Hu Mazi!
“Watch out!”
Chen Ping yanked Hu Mazi to his side, brandishing the Dragon-Slaying Sword and slashing at the creature’s head.
A sharp “clang” rang out as the sword’s energy struck the monster’s scales, only to be deflected.
The creature let out a roar, its tail whipping like a steel lash, shattering the stone beneath their feet.
“It’s a Lava Demon Lizard!”
Hu Mazi recognised the beast, “Ancient texts say it feeds on lava, impervious to blades and immune to fire and water!”
Chen Ping locked eyes with the creature’s fiery gaze, a chill running through him, “Its weakness must be its eyes. Master Hu, use your talisman skills to restrain it!”
Hu Mazi swiftly pulled out several talisman papers, infusing them with spiritual energy before hurling them at the lizard.
The talismans transformed into golden nets of light in mid-air, ensnaring the lizard’s body.
The lizard roared, its body erupting in flames that incinerated the nets, but it was momentarily restrained.
Seizing the chance, Chen Ping darted forward like an arrow, the Dragon-Slaying Sword gathering all his spiritual energy into a golden arc, piercing the lizard’s eye with precision!
“Roar—”
The lizard let out a piercing scream, its massive body thrashing wildly in the lava pool, sending molten rock raining down like a storm.
“Move!”
Chen Ping grabbed Hu Mazi, leaping to the opposite shore. Looking back, they saw the lizard struggle a few times before sinking into the pool, motionless.
The two collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath, their backs soaked with cold sweat.
“This Burial Demon Abyss is truly perilous at every step.”
Hu Mazi wiped the sweat from his face, “If this keeps up, even if the demons don’t kill us, exhaustion will.”
Chen Ping stood, gazing at the passage ahead, “Having crossed the lava pool, we’re likely close to the core area. Let’s push on.”
He took some pills from his pack and handed them to Hu Mazi, “Replenish your strength first. The path ahead will likely be even more dangerous.”
Hu Mazi took the pills but didn’t consume them immediately. Instead, he pulled out the clan leader’s token, carefully wiping the dust from it, “With my ancestors’ inheritance and this token, I feel filled with strength. No matter how dangerous, I’ll press on.”
Chen Ping saw the resolve in his eyes and gave a slight nod.
He knew Hu Mazi was no longer just a man chasing women, but a true heir to the Hu clan’s will.
After a brief rest, they continued down the passage.
At its end stood a massive stone gate, adorned with a ferocious demon head pattern, its eyes glowing red, exuding a terrifying aura.
“This must be the entrance to the core area.”
Chen Ping studied the demon head pattern, “The aura here is powerful, likely guarded by a restriction.”
Hu Mazi pressed the clan leader’s token against the gate. The token’s light clashed with the red glow of the demon head, producing a sizzling sound.
The stone gate trembled violently, the red light in the demon head’s eyes growing brighter, as if coming to life.
“It’s no use, the clan leader’s token can’t open this gate.”
Hu Mazi withdrew his hand, frowning, “The restriction on this gate was set by the demon clan, and it repels my ancestors’ talisman runes.”
