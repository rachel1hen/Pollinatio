At the moment the sword tip was about to touch Chen Ping’s clothing, he moved.
He did not draw his sword, merely tilting his body slightly, like a willow in the wind, appearing slow yet perfectly evading the fatal strike.
At the same time, he pressed his right index and middle fingers together, lightly flicking the spine of Wang Chong’s sword.
“Ding!”
After a crisp sound, Wang Chong felt a strange force travel through the sword, numbing his wrist. His long sword uncontrollably flicked upward.
This sudden change startled Wang Chong. He hurriedly withdrew his sword to defend, but Chen Ping’s figure closed in like a phantom, his fingertips glowing faintly with golden light, aiming for Wang Chong’s sword-holding wrist.
Wang Chong’s heart tightened. This seemingly ordinary finger sealed all possibilities for counter-moves.
He could only release the sword hilt, letting the blade fall to the ground, while retreating swiftly to create distance.
But would Chen Ping give him that chance?
Chen Ping stepped forward half a pace with his left foot, his right foot following smoothly, his entire body seeming to stick to Wang Chong’s back. His left hand lightly rested on Wang Chong’s shoulder.
“I concede.”
The calm voice sounded in Wang Chong’s ear. He felt a gentle yet irresistible force, causing his body to stumble forward a few steps, nearly falling off the stage.
Only when he steadied himself did he come to his senses. Looking at the Dragon-Slaying Sword still sheathed at Chen Ping’s waist, the colour drained from his face.
He had lost without even forcing his opponent to draw their sword?
The crowd below fell silent, stunned by this unbelievable scene.
Moments later, thunderous cheers erupted.
“Such swift movement!”
“What kind of finger technique is that? It deflected a sword move from an Earth Immortal realm?”
“This Chen Ping has some skill!”
Ling Xue and the others leapt up in excitement. Hu Mazi slapped his thigh, laughing, “I knew this kid had it in him!”
Mo Chen stood below the stage, a trace of surprise flashing in his eyes, soon turning to relief.
He recognised Chen Ping’s step as the Sword Sect’s “Snow Without Trace,” but Chen Ping had performed it with such finesse that it faintly carried the charm of the “Skyward Step.”
That finger technique had mastered “Sword Intent Manifestation” to perfection. Though it appeared as a finger, it contained sharp sword energy.
From the VIP platform, Zhao Jingfeng watched with a slight frown, saying to his junior brother beside him, “Interesting. This kid’s movement and finger techniques are decent, but his cultivation is too low.”
His junior brother nodded in agreement, “Senior Brother is right. It’s just some unorthodox tricks. Against Senior Brother’s ‘Sky-Splitting Sword Technique,’ he’d be exposed in an instant.”
Zhao Jingfeng gave a cold smile, saying no more, his gaze returning to the stage.
The following matches were uneventful, with the higher-cultivated generally winning. Only a few duels were particularly thrilling, drawing cheers from the crowd.
Soon, it was Zhao Jingfeng’s turn.
His opponent was a third-grade Earth Immortal disciple from the Iron Sword Sect. As soon as they clashed, Zhao Jingfeng unleashed the “Sky-Splitting Sword Technique.”
His long sword slashed with a piercing whistle that seemed to tear the air, each strike heavy and powerful, with faint lightning flickering in the sword shadows.
The Iron Sword Sect disciple’s moves were strong but lacked agility. Within three moves, Zhao Jingfeng knocked his sword away, then pressed the blade to his throat.
“I surrender!” the Iron Sword Sect disciple, pale-faced, shouted hastily.
Zhao Jingfeng sheathed his sword, scanning the crowd below, his gaze finally landing on Chen Ping with clear provocation.
Chen Ping merely returned a calm look, paying no heed.
The first round ended, and among the thirty-two advancing disciples, Chen Ping was the only one at the Loose Immortal realm.
This made many see him in a new light. To reach the second round at the eighth grade of the Loose Immortal realm was no fluke.
With this battle, Chen Ping’s name began to spread through Sword Saint City.
