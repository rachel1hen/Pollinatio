“Father, are you saying my sister really got it on with that Chen Ping?” Huo Shizi asked!
Huo Zhao fell silent, then nodded, “It seems to be true!”
“So, does that make Chen Ping my brother-in-law?” Huo Shizi’s thought process was bizarre.
“Shut up…” Huo Zhao glared, silencing his son.
Brother-in-law already? They didn’t even know the full story!
If Chen Ping had forced himself on his daughter, Huo Zhao would risk his life for revenge.
But if it was mutual, with both willing, Huo Zhao felt a bit at a loss.
While Huo Zhao’s mind raced, the battle raged on.
“Little beast, I’ll make you die!”
The Inspector went berserk, biting his tongue to spit out a mouthful of blood essence, his bone whip transforming into a hundred-metre blood dragon!
“Blood Dragon Devours the Heavens!”
The blood dragon roared towards Chen Ping, corroding the air with a sizzling sound!
“Child’s play!”
Chen Ping sneered, spiritual energy surging wildly as the Dragon-Slaying Sword appeared in his hand.
“Clang, clang, clang…”
Countless sword cries echoed through the heavens, and behind Chen Ping, ten thousand golden sword shadows emerged, shooting towards the blood dragon like a torrential storm!
“Boom! Boom! Boom!”
In deafening explosions, the blood dragon was pierced by the myriad swords, letting out a mournful wail before exploding into a sky of blood mist!
“Impossible!”
The Inspector’s face turned ashen, and he turned to Huo Zhao, “What are you standing there for? Help me!”
His words made Huo Zhao tremble slightly.
“Lord Inspector, you’re no match for Chen Ping. If I step in, I’d just be cannon fodder, wouldn’t I?”
Huo Zhao said!
“Insolent! You dare speak to me like that? I order you to stop Chen Ping at once!”
The Inspector turned to flee.
“Want to run?”
Chen Ping’s eyes blazed with killing intent. In a flash, he appeared behind the Inspector, his Dragon-Slaying Sword piercing through his chest!
“Splurt!”
Blood sprayed, and the Inspector looked down at the sword protruding from his chest, eyes filled with disbelief.
“You, you dare kill a Temple…”
“Too much nonsense!”
Chen Ping snorted coldly, swinging the Dragon-Slaying Sword!
“Slash!”
The Inspector’s body was cleaved in two, his spirit utterly destroyed!
At the same time, the two warrior statues finished off the last few Temple experts, and the battlefield fell silent.
“Gulp…”
Huo Zhao swallowed hard, his legs trembling uncontrollably.
Huo Shizi was even worse off, his crotch soaked, and as Chen Ping’s gaze swept over, he dropped to his knees with a thud, “Brother-in-law, spare me! I, I won’t do it again!”
Seeing this, Huo Jingjing rushed to Chen Ping’s side, grabbing his arm and pleading, “Chen Ping, for my sake, please spare my father and brother…”
Chen Ping glanced at Huo Jingjing, then at the ashen-faced Huo Zhao, and said lightly, “Father-in-law, can we have a proper talk now?”
Huo Zhao trembled, forcing a smile uglier than a grimace, “Dear, dear son-in-law, we’re family, what’s there we can’t discuss…”
Chen Ping’s lips curved slightly. The two ancient warriors turned into black light and returned to his body, while he wrapped an arm around Huo Jingjing’s slender waist and walked towards Huo Zhao, “In that case, from today, the Eight Halls will be under my command. Father-in-law, no objections, I presume?”
Huo Zhao didn’t dare object, nodding repeatedly, “No objections! Absolutely none! With your heaven-defying strength, dear son-in-law, the Eight Halls couldn’t be in better hands!”
Hu Mazi and the others couldn’t help but laugh.
Who could’ve imagined that Huo Zhao, who had come to kill Chen Ping with such bravado, was now quivering like a quail?
Where was the divine race’s pride? Their rule of never surrendering?
In truth, the divine race was self-proclaimed. These were just humans, with human emotions, desires, and fears.
Even the fear of death.
