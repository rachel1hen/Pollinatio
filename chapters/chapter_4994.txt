“Since you’re obedient, answer my question, or I have a hundred ways to kill you.”
Chen Ping asked Prince Huo.
“Alright, alright, ask away, I’ll tell you everything I know,” Prince Huo nodded repeatedly.
At this moment, Prince Huo was already scared out of his wits, ready to do whatever Chen Ping said.
“Since there’s a teleportation array in this city leading to the small city in the mountains, shouldn’t there also be arrays to other places?”
Chen Ping asked.
Since he needed to escape, Chen Ping couldn’t flee through the small mountain city. Huo Zhao was surely in that city, and it was likely filled with temple people, far stronger than the soldiers of Feihu City.
“I… I don’t know!” Prince Huo shook his head.
“Nonsense, how could you not know!”
Mad Immortal stepped forward and punched Prince Huo, making him scream in pain.
“I really, really don’t know.”
Prince Huo’s body trembled, veins bulging on his forehead, as he cried out in agony.
Mad Immortal threw several more punches.
Seeing Prince Huo spitting blood and barely clinging to life, Chen Ping waved a hand, “Stop, it seems this guy really doesn’t know.”
Mad Immortal stopped at that.
Prince Huo, crying, said, “I really don’t know. My father doesn’t let me wander around, only to teleport here for a bit. I truly don’t know about other arrays.”
“What a useless thing,” Mad Immortal glared at Prince Huo.
“Son-in-law, since he doesn’t know about the arrays, let’s just walk out boldly, all of us in soldiers’ armour, with Prince Huo leading. Who would dare stop us?”
Bai Yi said to Chen Ping.
“It’s the only way, though slower, it should be fine.”
Chen Ping nodded, and they all put on the soldiers’ armour again.
“Listen, take us out of here. If you try anything funny, you know the consequences.”
Chen Ping threatened Prince Huo.
“I wouldn’t dare, I absolutely wouldn’t…”
Prince Huo shook his head repeatedly.
Soon, under Prince Huo’s lead, Chen Ping and the others left the city smoothly, with no one daring to stop them.
But Chen Ping wouldn’t let Prince Huo go. They had only left one city, and to fully escape Feihu City’s territory, they still needed his identity.
…
Small mountain city!
After Huo Zhao brought the Temple’s Eight Halls here, the entire city was now filled with temple people.
Huo Zhao was in a secret chamber, recovering his body, a trip to the Heavenly Realm having taken a toll on him.
“Temple Master, Rhinoceros City suddenly attacked Feihu City, and it’s chaos now.”
“The prince has been away from the temple for a while, and we don’t know where he went.”
At this moment, an elder in a hemp robe walked in and said.
Huo Zhao opened his eyes, glanced at the elder, and said, “Great Elder, did Rhinoceros City start this fight for the treasure land?”
“Probably. Jie Zhong captured the son of Rhinoceros City’s lord, Niu Meng, to trade for the treasure land.”
“But Niu Meng didn’t save his son, instead launching an attack. It seems the treasure land is very important to Rhinoceros City.”
The Great Elder said.
“The treasure land’s opening time hasn’t come yet, let them fight it out, no rush.”
“Take some people and bring the prince back, don’t get involved in these beast clan disputes.”
Huo Zhao ordered.
“Yes!” The Great Elder nodded, but as he turned to leave, Huo Zhao’s face changed, “Damn it, he left the city?”
“That little brat, I told him not to leave the city, and he did it anyway. Take more people and make sure you drag the prince back.”
“Understood!” The Great Elder’s figure quickly vanished.
