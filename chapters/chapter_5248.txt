Chen Ping was momentarily stunned, not expecting Mo Chen to invite him to join the Sword Sect.
After a moment’s thought, he said, “I appreciate your kindness, Senior, but my heart is set on revenge. I’m afraid I don’t have time to stay and cultivate with the Sword Sect.”
Mo Chen, stroking his white beard, smiled undeterred, a glint of seriousness in his eyes, “Young man, I understand your concerns, fearing entanglement in the disputes between our Sword Sect and the Divine Sword Manor.
But you wield the Sword Sect’s swordsmanship, sharing a deep connection with us. How could I let such talent go to waste?”
He stepped aside, clearing the centre of the courtyard. In his hand appeared an ordinary wooden sword, its surface worn and mottled, clearly used for years.
“Come, let’s spar lightly, stopping at the first touch. If you can last a hundred moves against me or best me even slightly, I won’t mention joining the Sword Sect again and will let you leave at once.”
Chen Ping’s brows furrowed tightly. He had no desire to oppose the former Sword Sect leader, but Mo Chen’s resolute attitude showed he wouldn’t let them go easily.
Glancing at Hu Mazi, who looked equally helpless, Chen Ping steeled himself and said, “Senior, my skills are humble, likely unworthy of your notice.”
“No matter, just do your best.”
Mo Chen waved a hand, pointing the wooden sword casually at the ground, “Make your move.”
Chen Ping took a deep breath, channelling his spiritual energy. The Dragon-Slaying Sword hummed, glowing with golden light.
Knowing this fight was unavoidable, he resolved to give his all.
With a swift movement, he unleashed his swordsmanship, the blade flowing like gentle streams, carrying a relentless onslaught towards Mo Chen.
Mo Chen’s eyes lit up, and he praised, “Well done.”
With a light flick of his wooden sword, he moved slowly yet always managed to block the Dragon-Slaying Sword at the critical moment.
The clanging of metal rang out continuously. Though Chen Ping’s strikes were swift, he couldn’t breach Mo Chen’s defence.
In Mo Chen’s hands, the ordinary wooden sword seemed alive, at times steady as an ancient tree’s roots, immovable as a mountain; at others, swift as a striking snake.
After dozens of moves, sweat beaded on Chen Ping’s forehead, his heart filled with shock.
He could tell Mo Chen wasn’t using his full strength. Each block was perfectly measured, neutralizing Chen Ping’s attacks without harming him, as if guiding his swordsmanship.
“Senior, if you don’t use your full strength, I’ll concede now,” Chen Ping said, stepping back and sheathing his sword.
Mo Chen smiled, “Very well, I’ll show you the true essence of the Sword Sect’s swordsmanship.”
As his words fell, his figure blurred, and the wooden sword surged forward with overwhelming momentum.
The strike seemed unremarkable, yet it gave Chen Ping a sense of inescapability, forcing him to raise his sword to block.
“Clang!”
A loud crash echoed. Chen Ping felt an immense force, nearly losing his grip on the Dragon-Slaying Sword. He staggered back, his blood and qi churning.
At that moment, Mo Chen withdrew his left hand, holding the sword with only his right, and said calmly, “I’ll use one hand. Try again.”
A spark of defiance flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes. He raised his sword once more.
Combining the *Flowing Cloud Sword Technique* with his own sword intent, his moves grew sharper, the golden light dazzling.
Yet, even with just one hand, Mo Chen’s sword remained an impenetrable barrier. No matter how fiercely Chen Ping attacked, he couldn’t shake it. Instead, Mo Chen’s seemingly casual counters repeatedly put him in peril.
After dozens more moves, Mo Chen’s wooden sword flicked, striking precisely on the spine of the Dragon-Slaying Sword.
Chen Ping’s wrist went numb, unable to hold the sword any longer. It flew from his grasp, landing with a clang in the nearby vegetable patch.
Chen Ping stood frozen, staring at his empty hands, a mix of emotions swirling in his heart.
He had given everything, even burning some of his spiritual energy, yet he couldn’t match Mo Chen using just one hand. Was this the strength of a top-tier sword cultivator?
