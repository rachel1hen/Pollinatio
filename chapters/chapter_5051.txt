“You go and try again…”
Tianci said to the man in green robes.
The man in green robes had an extremely grim expression. If he could defeat Tianci, he would have already struck to kill this guy.
Unfortunately, he was not Tianci’s match at the moment.
He somewhat regretted coming in; it would have been better not to enter this place from the start.
Now, he had no chance to escape, as Tianci’s aura had long locked onto him, precisely to prevent him from fleeing.
If he dared to entertain the slightest thought of escape at this moment, Tianci would undoubtedly strike without hesitation.
This guy was bloody and cruel.
But if he continued to walk forward now, and the warrior statues suddenly attacked, he felt he might not be able to withstand it.
In his dilemma, Chen Ping shouted loudly, “You think you’re more handsome than me? Then come over here!”
“These two statues won’t attack handsome guys…”
“What are you waiting for?” Tianci asked the man in green robes coldly.
“Young Master Tianci, can’t someone else go? I’ve already tried once and got seriously injured,” the man in green robes said reluctantly.
“What? You’re not going to try, so I should try myself?” Tianci’s eyes narrowed.
“You could…”
The man in green robes scanned around, unable to let Elder Tong go, and then fixed his gaze on the black-robed elders behind the white-robed woman.
“Let them go…” the man in green robes said.
“What? You’re afraid of Tianyuan Pavilion, but not our Shura Hall?” The white-robed woman’s eyes flashed with killing intent instantly.
The man in green robes trembled, too scared to speak further.
“Sigh…”
The man in green robes sighed, his face ashen, but under pressure, he could only grit his teeth and walk towards the stone platform again.
With every step, he stared intently at the two warrior statues, fearing they might suddenly spring to life.
However, the moment he stepped onto the stone platform—
Boom! Boom!
The two statues suddenly opened their eyes, and their long blades slashed down fiercely!
“Damn it!”
The man in green robes roared, frantically channeling all his spiritual energy to resist.
But his defence was like paper before the statues’ attack, instantly shattered!
“Pfft—”
Blood sprayed wildly as the man in green robes was slashed and sent flying, crashing heavily to the ground with a gruesome wound across his chest, his aura weakened to the extreme.
“Why… why do they only attack me?” he roared in anger and frustration.
The crowd exchanged glances, all puzzled.
Why did the statues only attack the man in green robes and not Chen Ping?
Tianci frowned, his gaze shifting between Chen Ping and the statues, finally saying coldly, “It seems the attack mechanism of these two statues isn’t simply based on gender or strength.”
“Then what is it?” the white-robed woman asked, frowning.
“Perhaps… bloodline?” Tianci narrowed his eyes, staring at Chen Ping. “This kid might have something special about him.”
Chen Ping’s heart stirred, but he remained calm on the surface, shrugging, “Maybe I’m just lucky?”
“Hmph!” Tianci snorted coldly, clearly unconvinced.
But now, with the man in green robes gravely injured and others too wary to try, the only one who could approach the stone platform was Chen Ping!
“You, go open those three coffins!” Tianci ordered.
Chen Ping glanced at him and said lightly, “Why should I listen to you?”
“Defy me?” Tianci’s eyes surged with killing intent. “Then I’ll kill you right now!”
Mo Qingyun nervously grabbed Tianci’s sleeve, whispering, “Brother Tianci, don’t be rash…”
Mo Qingyun feared Tianci would really attack Chen Ping!
With Tianci and Elder Tong together, Chen Ping would surely be no match.
“I’ll try…” The white-robed woman glanced disdainfully at Tianci, then walked towards the stone platform.
Her steps were slow, each one causing ripples in the void.
