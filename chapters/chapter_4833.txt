Soon, two figures sped toward Chen Ping and Nan Batian, their bodies cloaked in flames, faces hidden behind masks!
When Chen Ping saw them, his brows furrowed instantly!
Especially the woman among them, at first glance, she gave him an oddly familiar feeling!
“Brother Ning…”
As the two reached Chen Ping, he clasped his fists in greeting toward Ning Zhi!
Ning Zhi, seeing Chen Ping alongside Nan Batian, was momentarily stunned, then returned the gesture, “Fellow Daoist Chen, have you already succeeded in the challenge?”
Chen Ping nodded, then glanced at Su Yuqi beside Ning Zhi, asking, “Brother Ning, who’s this beside you…?”
“Oh, this is my senior sister…”
Ning Zhi replied!
“Your senior sister feels strangely familiar somehow?”
Chen Ping stared intently at Su Yuqi, then extended his hand, “Hello…”
He wanted to make contact with Su Yuqi to get a better sense of her aura!
But Su Yuqi stepped back, eyeing Chen Ping warily!
“Sorry, my senior sister’s a bit peculiar, she doesn’t touch men.”
Ning Zhi quickly explained!
Chen Ping could only offer a helpless smile, never imagining that beneath that mask was Su Yuqi, the one he’d longed for day and night!
“Fellow Daoist Chen, since you’ve passed the challenge, you can head to the second tier, we still need to face ours!”
Ning Zhi finished, then turned a cold gaze toward Nan Batian, ready to make a move!
Nan Batian glanced at Chen Ping, saying nothing, and hid behind him!
“Brother Ning, you don’t need to challenge anymore, once you’re out, you can go straight to the second tier.”
“He’s been tamed by me, he’s my man now…”
Chen Ping said!
“What?” Ning Zhi was dumbfounded, sizing Chen Ping up in disbelief, “How could you tame him? That’s even possible?”
“Of course, they’re flesh-and-blood cultivators with thoughts, not robots!”
Chen Ping replied!
But after saying that, he gave a wry smile, realizing “robots” wouldn’t mean anything to them!
After all, only the secular world knew what robots were!
What Chen Ping didn’t know was that Ning Zhi, standing across from him, also came from the secular world and understood perfectly!
“Fellow Daoist Chen, you’re not tricking us, are you?”
Ning Zhi still didn’t believe it!
“Why would I trick you? If you don’t believe me, you’ll see once we’re out!”
Chen Ping grabbed Nan Batian, and with a flicker of thought, they instantly appeared outside the Heavenly Ladder!
Seeing Chen Ping and Nan Batian truly leave, Ning Zhi was floored!
“Damn it…”
Ning Zhi cursed, how was he supposed to kill Chen Ping now?
As Nan Batian exited the Heavenly Ladder, the first tier’s world began to glow with white light!
Every cultivator from the Heavenly Human Realm who’d entered the first tier felt a strange surge within them, followed by the appearance of a clearance mark!
Then, a tremendous force teleported all the Heavenly Human Realm cultivators out!
“What’s going on? Why am I out?”
“I haven’t even challenged yet, how did I get sent out?”
“A clearance mark, you can pass the first tier without fighting?”
The teleported cultivators were all bewildered!
Lin Keting, equally confused, scanned her surroundings blankly, then spotted Chen Ping and ran over!
Lin Chong, Wuji Daoist, and the others were also puzzled!
They couldn’t understand why, after entering the first tier for such a short time, everyone had been teleported out!
Even the glowing gate on the massive stone steps of the Heavenly Ladder’s first tier gradually faded away!
“Mr. Chen, what’s happening?”
Lin Chong, Wuji Daoist, and the others approached Chen Ping, asking!
“Don’t panic, it’s fine, it’s fine!” Chen Ping, seeing Lin Chong and Wuji Daoist’s nervous expressions, quickly reassured them!
