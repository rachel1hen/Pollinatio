“Can people from the Second Heaven come to this First Heaven?” Chen Ping asked.
“Of course they can, not just the Second Heaven, even the Supreme Saints from the Thirty-Sixth Heaven could come to the First Heaven, but they simply wouldn’t bother!”
“In their eyes, you’re not even an ant, so why would they come here?”
“Think about it, would you go to an ant’s world to show off? Stepping on dozens of ants at once, would that make you feel good?”
“And in an ant’s world, what could you possibly gain?”
“Nothing but a waste of time!” Hu Mazi said.
“That makes sense, but if people from the Second Heaven can come to the First Heaven without any restrictions, doesn’t that make the First Heaven very dangerous?” Chen Ping was puzzled, thinking how risky it would be without limits.
“That’s the Heavenly Realm for you, where you could lose your life at any moment. Right now, if a Heavenly Immortal from the Ninth Heaven came to the First Heaven, they could wipe out everyone here in an instant!”
“I remember many years ago, the Third Heaven was completely erased by a Golden Immortal, but as the river of time flowed, cultivators reappeared in the Third Heaven, and it remained the Third Heaven!”
“After that incident, that Golden Immortal was punished by the Heavenly Dao, and it seems they were utterly destroyed. The Heavenly Realm has its rules, even if you could easily annihilate a world, you’re not allowed to do so!” Hu Mazi explained to Chen Ping.
After all, Chen Ping knew very little about the Heavenly Realm.
Xiu Rui, listening on the side, also chimed in with some knowledge about the Heavenly Realm.
“Swish…”
Just as Chen Ping and the others were deep in conversation, a sharp arrow suddenly shot towards them, leaving a trail as it tore through the void!
“Bloody hell…”
The three of them were startled, caught off guard by a sneak attack!
Fortunately, though the arrow was incredibly sharp, its speed wasn’t particularly fast.
After narrowly dodging it, the trio immediately looked towards the direction the arrow came from.
At the same time, Chen Ping, wielding his Dragon-Slaying Sword, swung it with a single strike!
But as his sword struck, he noticed a child’s head poking out from where the arrow had been shot.
The child had a single horn on their head, and a pair of big, dark eyes were secretly watching them.
Chen Ping froze, then flicked his wrist, redirecting the sword’s energy to veer past the child, blasting a deep crater into the ground nearby.
The child was startled and shouted, “Big sister, there are humans trespassing in our territory…”
Seeing this, Chen Ping instantly realised this wasn’t a human domain but a beast clan’s territory!
So, Chen Ping released the beast clan aura within him.
Hu Mazi and Xiu Rui quickly slapped concealment talismans onto themselves.
Following the child’s shout, a girl who looked about eighteen or nineteen years old came rushing over.
When she saw Chen Ping and the others, she immediately smacked the child on the head and said, “Who told you to wander off? These three are clearly our people, and you called them humans?”
“I…” The child looked wronged, but upon sensing Chen Ping and the others, they indeed couldn’t detect any human aura.
“Dear friends, I’m terribly sorry. My little brother is still young and isn’t good at distinguishing auras. Please forgive him,” the girl said, stepping forward to apologise to Chen Ping and the others.
“It’s fine, but this sort of thing can’t happen again. Your brother just ambushed us, and if we hadn’t dodged in time, we could’ve been injured,” Chen Ping said to the girl.
Hearing this, the girl’s face turned stern as she pulled the child over and said, “Apologise now, you reckless little thing. If you’d hurt our own people and someone reported it to the city lord, we’d never be allowed into the city!”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…”
The child hurriedly apologised to Chen Ping and the others.
