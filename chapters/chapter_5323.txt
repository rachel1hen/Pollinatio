Chen Ping took the chance through dual cultivation to continually refine the power of the three clans within him together with his dragon power.
The meridian injuries he had suffered from using the Divine King Bow quickly healed under the dense immortal energy and Ling Xue’s gentle nourishment. The spiritual power in his dantian grew ever more condensed, faintly pressing toward the threshold of the Earth Immortal Realm.
However, this tranquillity was suddenly broken by Hu Mazi not far away.
That day, just as Chen Ping was guiding a surge of violent dragon power into Ling Xue’s body to help her impact the seventh rank of the Earth Immortal Realm, she could not hold back a muffled sound, fine beads of sweat forming on her forehead.
The moment her soft cry fell, a dull thud came from the stone platform opposite, Hu Mazi had fallen off it.
“Master Hu, what is the matter?”
Chen Ping quickly withdrew his power, ran over and asked with concern.
Hu Mazi rubbed the back of his head as he climbed up, glaring at Chen Ping with frustration. “Nothing! I just sat too long and my legs went numb!”
Yet his expression clearly carried unease, especially when his eyes flicked toward Ling Xue. He quickly looked away, but a suspicious flush had already spread across his cheeks.
The more he looked, the more shy Ling Xue felt. She lowered her head at once, her ears red to the point of dripping blood.
Chen Ping then realised. Though he and Ling Xue had hidden themselves in a secluded spot, others could not see them, but sound could not be blocked.
These days, whenever the two cultivated together, Ling Xue’s cries had risen wave after wave. Hu Mazi must have heard them all.
With his temperament, listening to such sounds, how could he not be affected.
Chen Ping gave a dry cough, awkwardly saying, “Master Hu, should I set up a sound barrier for you?”
“No, no need!”
Hu Mazi waved his hand quickly, stiffening his neck. “Do I look like that kind of vulgar man? You continue with your training, I will continue with my recovery, we will not disturb each other!”
Yet in truth, hearing Miss Ling Xue’s cries was rather stimulating…
After speaking, Hu Mazi turned back, jumped onto the stone platform and sat cross-legged with his back to them. But his faintly trembling shoulders betrayed his unsettled state of mind.
Ling Xue’s face burned as she looked at Chen Ping. “Senior Brother, you should be gentler next time, you do not even care about my life…”
“What can I do, you are too delicate…”
Chen Ping chuckled.
In the days that followed, Hu Mazi indeed kept quiet. Yet from time to time, dull thumps could be heard as his fists struck the stone platform.
Chen Ping and Ling Xue tried to restrain their aura, but when cultivation reached critical points, the reactions from the surging spiritual energy were impossible to suppress.
Whenever Ling Xue’s soft moans sounded, the movements from the opposite platform would falter, soon followed by heavier breathing.
Such awkward yet laughable days lasted for a long while. The immortal energy inside the tower grew thinner as the three of them absorbed it madly, but their cultivation rose at an astonishing pace.
Ling Xue was the first. With Chen Ping’s full support, she broke through one bottleneck after another, leaping from the fourth rank of the Earth Immortal Realm to the seventh. The spiritual power around her condensed into substance, faintly carrying a sharp sword intent.
Then came Chen Ping. In a key moment of dual cultivation, the spiritual power in his dantian erupted, the dragon power and the three clan powers merged completely. Golden scales instantly covered his body, and a dragon’s roar echoed through the tower. He had broken through to the Earth Immortal Realm.
Most astonishing of all was Hu Mazi. Perhaps because the immortal energy was too abundant, or because he had pent up too much frustration, not only did his damaged divine sense recover completely, his cultivation also skyrocketed, reaching the ninth rank.
This was the peak he had reached before his reincarnation, now fully restored.
That day, as the three of them finished cultivation together, the entire Demon Suppressing Tower trembled slightly. Three powerful auras shot skyward, intertwining into a brilliant glow.
Chen Ping looked at Ling Xue, his eyes full of warmth. “Congratulations, Junior Sister.”
