Chen Ping was struggling to cope amid the storm-like attacks, with more and more wounds appearing on his body.
The golden holy light clung to him like maggots on a bone; once it touched his body, it would burn his flesh and blood. If not for the evil qi barely suppressing it, he would have fallen long ago.
But the light in his eyes grew even firmer. Although Wang Shengguang’s attacks were fierce, they also gave him a deeper understanding of the operation of divine power. The counterattacks from the Dragon-Slaying Sword became increasingly precise.
“Chi!”
Chen Ping seized a flaw in Wang Shengguang’s attack. The Dragon-Slaying Sword struck like a venomous snake emerging from its hole, slicing through a gap in the golden armour. A wisp of evil qi invaded Wang Shengguang’s body through the wound.
Wang Shengguang let out a muffled groan; his aura instantly became disordered, and the golden light on his body dimmed slightly.
“Seeking death!”
Wang Shengguang was both shocked and furious. He never expected his holy body to be eroded by evil qi.
He suddenly slapped a palm onto Chen Ping’s chest, sending Chen Ping flying. At the same time, he circulated his spiritual power to force out the evil qi in his body; his face became even more sombre.
The two pulled apart once more, both panting heavily.
Chen Ping’s left arm was twisted unnaturally, clearly fractured. The clothes on his chest were stained red with blood, and blood trickled continuously from the corners of his mouth.
Wang Shengguang’s condition was slightly better, but his armour now had several sword marks. One of the light wings on his back was damaged, and his aura was noticeably less stable than before.
Outside the Holy Light Hall, all the disciples of the Holy Light Sect were dumbfounded.
The sect master, whom they regarded as a god in their hearts, had actually been beaten into this state by a Loose Immortal Realm cultivator?
Hu Mazi watched anxiously, unable to hold back any longer and about to rush in. But he was firmly held back by Mo Chen: “Don’t be impulsive! If you go in now, you’ll only drag Chen Ping down!”
“But if this continues, Chen Ping will be worn down to death!” Hu Mazi said urgently.
Mo Chen said nothing, just staring intently at the figures inside the hall. A flash of determination crossed his eyes; if Chen Ping truly couldn’t hold on, he would risk his life to buy Chen Ping a sliver of hope.
Inside the hall, Wang Shengguang felt the disordered spiritual power in his body and the evil qi that was constantly corroding his meridians. For the first time, a trace of wariness rose in his eyes.
He looked at Chen Ping and suddenly grinned: “Good! Very good! It’s been a long time since I’ve encountered an opponent who can make me so excited! As a reward, I’ll let you witness true power!”
As soon as the words fell, Wang Shengguang’s aura began to surge wildly.
The originally dim golden light brightened again, even more intense than before. The runes on the six pairs of light wings seemed to come alive, spinning frantically.
Ripples appeared in the space around him; a pressure far more terrifying than before spread out. The spiritual qi of the entire Holy Light Plain began to converge here.
“He… he’s about to break through?!” Mo Chen’s face changed drastically, his eyes filled with disbelief.
Wang Shengguang, who had been stuck at the peak of the eighth grade of the Earth Immortal Realm for decades, had actually touched the threshold of the ninth grade during his fierce battle with Chen Ping!
Chen Ping’s pupils also contracted sharply. He could clearly feel the power in Wang Shengguang’s body growing exponentially. That divine power became purer and more terrifying.
He gritted his teeth, enduring his injuries forcibly. He poured all his remaining spiritual power and evil qi into the Dragon-Slaying Sword, preparing to face the coming storm.
“Buzz…”
The golden light on Wang Shengguang reached its peak; the six pairs of light wings behind him fully unfolded, covering more than half of the Holy Light Hall.
He slowly opened his eyes; there was no longer any human emotion in them, only cold majesty.
“Earth Immortal Realm ninth grade… finally!”
Wang Shengguang felt the surging power in his body and let out a hearty long howl. “Chen Ping, to witness my breakthrough, you can die content!”
He took a step forward, and his figure instantly disappeared from the spot.
Chen Ping’s heart rang with alarm; he instinctively placed the Dragon-Slaying Sword horizontally behind him.
