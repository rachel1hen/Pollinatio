Chen Ping’s expression was grave, not daring to show the slightest negligence.
He could sense the terrifying spatial power within this sword strike; a single misstep could reduce him to dust.
Taking a deep breath, he pushed his internal spiritual energy to its limit, the Dragon-Slaying Sword tracing a perfect arc in his hand.
“Dragon-Warding Strike!”
A golden sword beam, like a colossal dragon, spiralled upwards, clashing with the space-rending sword shadow.
“Boom!”
Another deafening explosion rang out, and faint cracks appeared in the arena’s “Spirit-Locking Array.”
Both combatants staggered back three steps, their blood and qi churning.
A flicker of surprise crossed Zhao Jingfeng’s eyes; he hadn’t expected Chen Ping to withstand his “Stone-Cleaving Cloud-Piercer.”
“Interesting. Again!”
Zhao Jingfeng let out a long roar, his sword flashing even faster.
“Heaven-Splitting Sword Technique, Second Form: Aura Piercing the Rainbow!”
“Heaven-Splitting Sword Technique, Third Form: Heaven Collapsing, Earth Cracking!”
He unleashed two consecutive moves, each more domineering than the last, with spatial rifts multiplying in the sword shadows, as if the entire arena might be torn apart.
Chen Ping responded calmly, alternating between “Dragon-Slaying Strike” and “Dragon-Warding Strike,” at times fierce and domineering, at others agile and elusive. The golden sword beams clashed repeatedly with the space-rending shadows, producing ear-splitting roars.
The spectators below watched in stunned silence; this was no longer a sparring match but a fight to the death.
“Too thrilling! This is a true clash of elite swordsmanship!”
“Zhao Jingfeng’s ‘Heaven-Splitting Sword Technique’ lives up to its name, but Chen Ping is unbelievably tenacious!”
“Who will win in the end?”
On the VIP platform, Qin Fenglie stared intently at the arena, fists clenched. He knew Zhao Jingfeng had unleashed eighty percent of his strength yet still couldn’t defeat Chen Ping, filling him with unease.
Mo Chen, meanwhile, looked worried. Though Chen Ping was holding off Zhao Jingfeng’s onslaught for now, he was only an eighth-grade Loose Immortal; his spiritual energy would deplete faster than Zhao Jingfeng’s. If this continued, he might not hold out.
On the arena, the two collided once more, each retreating over ten steps.
Chen Ping’s face was pale, a trickle of blood seeping from his mouth, clearly injured. Yet his gaze remained resolute, his grip on the Dragon-Slaying Sword steady as a rock.
Zhao Jingfeng was no better off, his breathing erratic, sweat beading on his forehead. He hadn’t anticipated Chen Ping’s resilience; even with eighty percent of his strength, he couldn’t bring him down.
“Brat, you’re courting death!”
Enraged, Zhao Jingfeng let out a fierce roar, his spiritual energy erupting without restraint. His hair fluttered without wind, his eyes gleaming with madness.
“Heaven-Splitting Sword Technique, Fourth Form: Eternal Damnation!”
This sword strike, the most terrifying of the “Heaven-Splitting Sword Technique,” was filled with spatial rifts, like a massive black hole threatening to devour everything around it.
The crowd below was horrified; this strike’s power exceeded the sixth-grade Earth Immortal level, reaching the seventh-grade.
“Has Zhao Jingfeng lost his mind? To use such a move!”
“Chen Ping, concede! You’ll die if you keep fighting!”
Ling Xue and the others were pale with fear, wanting to rush the stage, but Mo Chen held them back. He knew intervening now would be futile and might disrupt Chen Ping.
Facing this apocalyptic strike, Chen Ping’s eyes were eerily calm.
He felt his spiritual energy nearly depleted, yet his sword intent surged to unprecedented heights.
“Dragon-Slaying Sword, fight with me!”
With a long roar, Chen Ping poured his last shred of spiritual energy into the Dragon-Slaying Sword.
In an instant, the sword blazed with unparalleled light, a faint dragon’s silhouette emerging within the golden beam.
“Dragon-Soaring Strike!”
This was a new move Chen Ping had comprehended during his clash with Li Hanjiang, blending the dominance of “Dragon-Slaying Strike” with the agility of “Dragon-Warding Strike,” its power surpassing both.
