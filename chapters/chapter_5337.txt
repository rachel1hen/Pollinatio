“We will find them eventually.”
Chen Ping patted his shoulder, his tone firm. “The main hall of the Evil Path Palace, we will go there sooner or later. This account must be settled clearly.”
The two of them scavenged all the resources from the branch hall of the Evil Path Palace, then without lingering, they turned and walked towards the outside of the valley.
Passing by the palace, Chen Ping could not help but glance at the depths. There it was a mess, vaguely a smear of scarlet blood could be seen, the air still lingered with You Yue’s desperate aura. Evidently, she had long perished in Hu Mazi’s fury.
Exiting the Blood Bone Valley, Hu Mazi looked back at this valley covered with white bones. A flash of severity passed through his eyes, he suddenly raised his hand and threw out several powerful explosive talismans and flame talismans. “Destroy it for me!”
The talismans exploded in the air, instantly detonating the remaining evil qi and spiritual power in the valley. Explosion sounds rose one after another, flames soared into the sky, the entire Blood Bone Valley gradually collapsed amid the rumbling.
Those white bones and corpses were incinerated completely by the flames, finally turning into a scorched black ruin, no longer showing the former appearance.
“Let’s go!” Hu Mazi turned around, without looking back, he walked towards the direction of the Sword Sect.
His back carried a trace of fatigue, yet it revealed an unyielding perseverance.
Chen Ping looked at that ruin, a trace of gravity flashed in his eyes.
Although the branch hall of the Evil Path Palace was destroyed, the main hall was still a huge threat, like a sharp sword hanging over their heads.
Not to mention, there was also that mysterious and unpredictable God Palace, similarly eyeing them covetously.
The road ahead was still full of thorns and unknowns.
But he knew he could not retreat.
Activating the Imperial Sky Technique to the extreme, two streaks of flowing light cut across the horizon of the Fifth Heaven, speeding towards the direction of Sword Saint City.
Chen Ping glanced sideways at Hu Mazi beside him. The latter’s hands were clenched into fists, knuckles turning white. The face that usually carried a bit of rugged smile now only had an irresolvable gloom.
In this trip to the Blood Bone Valley, they had flattened the branch hall of the Evil Path Palace, killed You Wuxie, You Wuji, and even the branch hall master. But the most crucial Hu clan’s divine souls, they only got the news that they had been sent to the main hall.
They did not even know if they had been refined.
“Master Hu,” Chen Ping slowed down, his voice steady. “Since the main hall of the Evil Path Palace dared to take in the Hu clan’s divine souls, it means they have not been completely refined yet. As long as the people are still there, there will always be a day to find them.”
Hu Mazi took a deep breath, his Adam’s apple bobbed twice, his voice carrying a bit of hoarseness. “I know… but thinking that the clan’s divine souls might still be suffering torture, my heart feels like it’s being scorched by fire.”
He raised his hand and pounded his chest, a trace of bloodshot flashed in his eyes. “Back then, if I hadn’t entered reincarnation, the Hu clan wouldn’t have fallen to this state…”
“Past matters, no need to blame yourself anymore.”
Chen Ping patted his shoulder, the Dragon-Slaying Sword buzzed at his side, as if echoing this firmness. “Next, we will search together. The main hall of the Evil Path Palace, the six halls of the God Palace, this account will be settled clearly sooner or later.”
Hu Mazi raised his eyes to look at Chen Ping, seeing no hesitation in his eyes. The knot in his heart slightly loosened, he nodded heavily. “Good! With your words, I am relieved!”
The two said no more, the spiritual power around them surged again, their figures turned into two faster streaks of flowing light, flying towards the outline of Sword Saint City.
Approaching Sword Saint City, from afar they saw dozens of figures standing at the city gate. The leader was precisely Mo Chen.
He was in a cyan-grey Taoist robe, standing with hands behind his back, his gaze fixed on the horizon. Until he saw the figures of Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, his tense brows slightly relaxed.
“You’re back.”
Mo Chen stepped forward to greet them, his gaze swept over the remaining bloodstains and evil qi on the two, a trace of concern flashed in his eyes. “How did the matter of the Evil Path Palace branch hall go?”
Chen Ping cupped his hands in salute, said solemnly. “Fortunately, we did not fail the mission. The branch hall of the Evil Path Palace has been completely destroyed, the branch hall master and the main cultivators have all been executed. It’s just that…”
