“There really is such a person. The Tenth Hall has fought against him!” Huò Qīng said.
“Young Master, have you ever fought against this expert?” Steward Lú asked.
Huò Qīng shook his head.
“Brother, have you seen this expert in action?” Huò Míng asked.
Huò Qīng still shook his head.
“Brother, when did you become so timid? No matter who this expert is, I’ll deal with him today.”
Huò Míng swung his spear, and the entire void trembled.
“Big Brother, this…”
Huò Qīng wanted to persuade him, but Huò Míng had already led his men into the territory of the Xiao Dynasty.
Huò Qīng wanted to follow, but fear held him back.
“Young Master, wait here. I’ll keep an eye on Big Brother.”
Steward Lú also rushed into the Xiao Dynasty.
The Tenth Hall Master hesitated, trying several times but not daring to enter. Huò Qīng’s words had made him cautious.
Ignorance breeds fearlessness. Huò Míng and Steward Lú simply didn’t believe that such a powerful cultivator existed in the Heavenly Realm.
Inside the Xiao Dynasty, Chen Ping led Lin Kefan and the others to the imperial city.
Xiao Yuanshan was shocked to see Chen Ping and his group arriving battered and bruised. For cultivators at the peak of the Mahayana Realm’s ninth level to be injured like this, their opponents must have been terrifyingly strong.
Fortunately, the Xiao Dynasty was protected by the aura of Mr. Shi. No matter how powerful the cultivators were, they wouldn’t dare cause trouble within the Xiao Dynasty.
“Everyone, recover quickly. The Tenth Hall likely won’t dare enter the Xiao Dynasty.”
Chen Ping urged everyone to regain their strength. The escape had taken a heavy toll.
“Your Majesty, someone has intruded…”
Just as Chen Ping finished speaking, a shout rang out.
Chen Ping and the others hurried out of the hall and looked up to see that the Tenth Hall had indeed chased them.
Over a dozen powerful figures arrived, their oppressive aura making it hard for the people of the Xiao Dynasty to lift their heads.
Huò Míng pointed his spear, and the void twisted. An invisible pressure spread over everyone, making it difficult to breathe.
“How does the Tenth Hall still have so many powerful experts?” Lin Kefan frowned.
“These aren’t from the Tenth Hall…”
At that moment, Yun Li appeared behind the group.
“Not from the Tenth Hall?” Chen Ping was surprised.
“These are people from the Huo family. Huò Qīng must have called them. The Tenth Hall isn’t this strong.”
As the son of the Tenth Hall Master, Yun Li knew the true strength of the Tenth Hall.
“The Huo family doesn’t seem ordinary either!”
Xuan Bin exclaimed.
Chen Ping stared at Huò Míng and the others, his expression calm.
Now that they were here, Chen Ping wasn’t afraid of anything. Even if an immortal showed up, Mr. Shi could probably slap them to death.
“I heard there’s an expert protecting this place. Where is he?”
Huò Míng looked at Chen Ping and asked.
“Someone like you isn’t worthy of Mr. Shi’s attention. If I hadn’t just fought a tough battle, I could take on two of you.”
Chen Ping snorted.
Huò Míng was stunned, then laughed. “You’re all talk. A mere second-level Mahayana cultivator dares to say such things. It seems all you can do is boast.”
“Whether I can back it up or not, you’ll find out soon enough. Come at me…” Chen Ping beckoned to Huò Míng.
“You think I won’t?”
Huò Míng took a step forward, his spear pointing at Chen Ping.
With that motion, a force capable of destroying heaven and earth shot toward Chen Ping.
Huò Míng had made his move.
Seeing Huò Míng attack, Chen Ping showed no panic, not even attempting to dodge.
“Die…”
Chen Ping uttered a single word.
Suddenly, a beam of white light descended from the sky, piercing through Huò Míng’s body in an instant.
The scene left Steward Lú and the others frozen in shock.
Huò Míng’s eyes widened in disbelief as he stared at the hole in his body.
