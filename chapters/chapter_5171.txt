He clutched his bleeding chest, horrified to find the flesh around the wound turning black and rotting at an eerie speed, the underworld energy carrying a terrifyingly corrosive power!
Chen Ping couldn’t believe it. His body was already so resilient, bolstered by the Unyielding Golden Body, yet it was still being eroded by the opponent’s underworld energy!
“Chen Ping!”
An anxious shout rang out. Hu Mazi, along with Huo Jingjing, Yun Wuya, Mo Qingyun, and others, led hundreds of Qingyun Sect disciples behind them.
They shielded Chen Ping, their faces grim as they gazed at the Two Elders of the Underworld hovering in the sky and the pervasive underworld energy on the ground.
These two old fiends were unexpectedly formidable, injuring Chen Ping in their first clash.
“Protect Chen Ping!”
Hu Mazi roared, flinging out hundreds of talismans from his sleeve. Golden light burst forth, forming a shield wall in front of Chen Ping.
Huo Jingjing, wielding an ancient sword, unleashed waves of sword energy aimed at Granny Ghostclaw’s soul beads.
“Hmph, more fools rushing to their deaths!”
Duke Drowned Souls swung his chain, the sickle arcing through the air, underworld flames transforming into a rain of fire crashing toward the Qingyun Sect disciples.
“Don’t be afraid…”
Yun Wuya bellowed, trying to steady his disciples.
However, dozens of dark figures suddenly materialized behind the Two Elders, their Underworld Shadow Guards.
Clad in black, their faces masked with ghostly visages, these shadow guards moved with eerie stealth. Their short blades glinted with venomous blue light, and upon appearing, they split into groups, surging toward the Qingyun Sect disciples like a tide.
“Watch out for the poisoned blades!”
A Qingyun Sect elder barely finished his warning when a disciple’s arm was slashed by a shadow guard. Black energy spread instantly, and the disciple fell, screaming.
The battlefield descended into chaos.
Hu Mazi’s golden talisman light clashed with the shadow guards’ venomous blades. Huo Jingjing’s ancient sword collided with Duke Drowned Souls’ underworld fire. Yun Wuya’s sword light met Granny Ghostclaw’s soul claws in a barrage, while Mo Qingyun’s aura contended with the pervasive wails of souls in the air.
“Pfft…”
A core Qingyun Sect disciple was caught in a pincer attack by two shadow guards. His long sword was shattered by a short blade, and a bone-deep gash was carved into his chest.
Another disciple attempted a rescue but was struck in the throat by a shadow guard’s poisoned needle, collapsing in a pool of blood with wide eyes.
“Kill!”
Huo Jingjing’s eyes blazed with fury. Her sword energy surged, bolstered by her ancient sword. She charged into the densest group of shadow guards but drew a heavy strike from Granny Ghostclaw’s soul bead. She endured it, spitting blood.
Yun Wuya’s swordplay grew faster, his sword net ensnaring several shadow guards, but Duke Drowned Souls’ chain entangled his blade. Granny Ghostclaw seized the moment, striking his back with a palm, making him stagger and cough up blood.
Hu Mazi pulled out his last trump card, a “Five Thunder Righteous Law Talisman.” Golden light flashed, and five thunderbolts as thick as buckets struck at the Two Elders, only to be blocked by their combined underworld shield.
Granny Ghostclaw sneered, her ten fingers flicking. Dozens of soul beads shot toward the densest group of Qingyun Sect disciples. Explosions rang out, blood and flesh splattered, and screams echoed through the ruins.
Chen Ping struggled to his feet, his eyes bloodshot as he took in the gruesome scene.
Suppressing the churning energy in his body, he took a deep breath, about to speak, when Crimson Cloud Demon Lord interjected, “Use me?”
Chen Ping nodded. “Yes.”
“Heh, I like it…”
Crimson Cloud Demon Lord chuckled, immediately taking control of Chen Ping’s body.
The Two Elders, seeing this, flashed cruel smiles, eyeing the young man with fury burning in his gaze.
The inky black clouds in the sky pressed lower, soul flames like countless vengeful eyes watching the carnage, staining the ruins in a hopeless blood-red hue.
As Crimson Cloud Demon Lord’s consciousness swept through Chen Ping’s limbs like wildfire, the atmosphere between heaven and earth turned violently turbulent.
