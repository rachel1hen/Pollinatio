Eighth Hall!
Huo Zhao, Huo Jingjing, and Huo Feng stood in the grand hall, their faces grim!
Huo Feng, in particular, was visibly gripped by fear and tension!
On the main seat of the Eighth Hall, a seemingly young cultivator sat calmly, holding a teacup, sipping tea lightly!
This was the Seventh Hall Master from the Third Heaven.
Huo Zhao and the others regarded the Seventh Hall Master with deep fear!
“Hall Master Huo, no need to be afraid, I’m merely here to observe, I heard you betrayed the Divine Hall, and the Fourth Hall Master sent me to take a look!”
“I’m quite curious, who could possibly make you so resolute in betraying the Divine Hall?”
The Seventh Hall Master asked indifferently!
“If we don’t betray the Divine Hall, we have no path to survival, peripheral forces like you and I receive fewer resources each time.”
“Moreover, we’re forbidden from dual cultivation or intermarriage with foreign clans, this is self-imposed stagnation, sooner or later, our Divine Hall, and even the entire Divine Clan, will decline!”
Huo Zhao said to the Seventh Hall Master!
“Impudent…”
The Seventh Hall Master frowned, with a slight wave of his hand, Huo Zhao was sent flying, crashing heavily to the ground!
With just that strike, Huo Zhao’s blood surged, nearly causing him to pass out!
The Seventh Hall Master, at the peak of the Loose Immortal Realm, was far beyond Huo Zhao’s ability to confront!
“Father…”
Huo Jingjing and Huo Feng rushed forward, helping Huo Zhao to his feet!
Seeing her father Huo Zhao coughing up blood, Huo Jingjing’s eyes blazed with crimson fury.
She drew her sword with a swift motion, its blade trembling as spiritual energy surged, pointing at the Seventh Hall Master seated above, her voice quivering with rage: “Seventh Hall Master! You dare harm my father! Disciples of the Eighth Hall, heed my command, today, even if it costs our lives, we’ll make him pay for his actions!”
Before her words faded, dozens of cultivators in the Eighth Hall responded with a roar, brandishing spiritual blades and treasures, their combined spiritual energy forming a searing wave that surged towards the Seventh Hall Master’s seat.
Huo Feng, pale-faced, gritted his teeth and tightly gripped his weapon, standing protectively in front of Huo Zhao.
The Seventh Hall Master set down his teacup, a cold, disdainful smirk curling his lips.
Without even rising, he merely flicked his fingertip, unleashing a golden beam of condensed energy that erupted like a devastating force, crashing into the oncoming crowd.
“Ants trying to shake a tree.”
He chuckled lightly, and wherever the beam passed, the Eighth Hall cultivators were flung back like broken kites, their artifacts shattered, blood spraying, collapsing in disarray across the hall.
“Jingjing! Stop!”
Huo Zhao struggled to stand, grabbing his daughter’s arm, “He’s at the peak of the Loose Immortal Realm, we… we’re no match for him!”
Huo Jingjing shook off her father’s hand, her hair in dishevelled strands, her eyes filled with defiance: “Are we just to watch him humiliate us?”
The Seventh Hall Master rose slowly, his gaze cutting through the crowd like a blade, his tone dripping with icy scorn: “A group of ants dares to speak of betrayal? Eighth Hall Master, is this Chen Ping you speak of the backing that emboldens you to defy the Divine Hall?”
He paused, his voice suddenly rising, echoing through the hall, “Chen Ping! If you don’t show yourself, I’ll clean house for the Divine Hall today, erasing the Eighth Hall from existence!”
“Seventh Hall Master, I said Chen Ping isn’t here, even if you wipe us out, Chen Ping won’t appear!”
Huo Zhao said to the Seventh Hall Master!
“Is that so? Since this Chen isn’t here, I’ll start by wiping you out.”
He Seventh Hall Master sneered coldly, “Once you’re gone, I’ll track down that Chen Ping, then I’ll see who he really is!”
As his words landed, two sets of hurried footsteps echoed from outside the hall.
Chen Ping, supporting Mo Qingyun’s shoulder, stepped slowly into the hall.
His face was slightly pale, a trace of blood lingered at the corner of his lips, clearly still wounded, his internal energy fluctuating faintly in disarray, his earlier battle had evidently taken a heavy toll on his strength greatly diminished.
