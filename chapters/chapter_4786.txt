“Brother, save me, save me…” Lin Keting panicked a bit, unsure how Chen Ping would punish her!
“Chen Ping, my little sister was just upset, she didn’t mean to disturb your cultivation, let her off this once, please!”
Lin Kefan hurriedly pleaded with Chen Ping!
But Chen Ping ignored him, slamming the door shut with a bang!
Soon, Lin Keting’s voice drifted out from the room, though the more everyone listened, the odder it sounded, it didn’t seem like she was being beaten, more like she was enjoying it!
Hua Yueying’s face flushed red, having just been through it herself, she knew exactly what those cries meant!
By now, Xuan Bin and the others caught on too, turning away awkwardly!
Lin Kefan, stuck between leaving and staying, didn’t know what to do…
No clue how long it went on, but the sky had darkened!
Chen Ping’s door opened, Lin Keting emerged nestled against his shoulder, smiling blissfully!
Seeing his little sister all lovey-dovey, Lin Kefan knew Chen Ping had fully won her over!
“Brother Chen, you’re incredible, from dawn to dusk, bloody enviable!”
Yun Li strolled into Chen Ping’s courtyard, oozing jealousy!
“You’re no slouch yourself, Brother Yun…” Chen Ping grinned faintly!
“Nah, I’m miles off!” Yun Li laughed, then added, “The Heaven Ladder’s set to pop up in the Lawless Land, there’s already weird stuff happening there, and a ton of cultivators are gathering, should we head over early to scope it out?”
“Sure, even if you hadn’t said it, I was itching to check it out!”
Chen Ping nodded eagerly!
“Great, we’ll set off tomorrow, but for your safety, we should split up.”
“With the Lawless Land being Huo family turf, all of us together would stick out like a sore thumb.”
Yun Li said!
“Fair enough, tomorrow I’ll go solo, you lot take the airship, bring plenty of resources, that Lawless Land’s got nothing to replenish with!”
Chen Ping still recalled the Tenth Hall Master’s words, no resources, not even spiritual energy in the Lawless Land, fighting there’d drain you dry with no way to recharge!
You’d have to haul heaps of resources to cultivate off your own stash!
Plans set, Chen Ping got Xing Daorong on the line that night, ordering him to ship over every immortal spirit stone from Beast City!
Then he grabbed Hua Yueying, heading back to the room!
This time, with both Hua Yueying and Lin Keting, it was Chen Ping’s way of patching things up between them!
Next morning!
Xing Daorong delivered ten thousand immortal spirit stones, while Chen Ping had Ji Yun prep the airship!
Ji Yun’s strength was still too low, no point in tagging along to the Lawless Land, without climbing the Heaven Ladder, a barren spot like that was useless!
Plus, with Yao Mei around, Ji Yun was knee-deep in bliss these days, not keen on roaming!
Chen Ping handed the airship to Xuan Bin to pilot, letting the crew cruise to the Lawless Land without burning energy, even cultivating onboard!
Chen Ping himself took to the skies, heading for the Lawless Land based on the Tenth Hall Master’s directions!
Xuan Bin, Zhou Tang, Cang Yue, Hua Yueying, Yun Li, Shi Lan, the Tenth Hall Master, Lin Kefan, Lin Keting.
They all piled into the airship, trailing Chen Ping at a safe distance!
Along the way, they crossed paths with plenty of cultivators bound for the Lawless Land!
And these folks were no slouches, the weakest clocking in at Eighth-Grade Mahayana Realm!
Chen Ping was gobsmacked, who knew the Celestial Human Realm hid so many heavy hitters!
While Chen Ping’s crew made for the Lawless Land, two figures in the far north of the Northern Domain were blazing toward it too!
They moved fast, flames licking around them, looking for all the world like a pair of burning meteors!
