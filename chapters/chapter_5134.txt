“If this thing is planted in the Demon Suppression Tower, wouldn’t there be immortal energy in the tower all the time?”
Chen Ping pondered, then brought the Chaos Spiritual Root along with the Chaos Stone into the Demon Suppression Tower!
Soon, the Chaos Spiritual Root began to grow at a visible speed right before Chen Ping’s eyes!
The flow of time inside the tower was a hundred times faster than outside, so the growth speed was much quicker!
Chen Ping smiled, collecting some immortal stones into the Demon Suppression Tower. From now on, when cultivating, Chen Ping would do so in the Demon Suppression Tower, as the speed would be much faster!
However, as Chen Ping’s realm improved, the consumption of resources was also immense!
If there were a few more plants like the Chaos Spiritual Root, which could continuously produce immortal energy, that would be ideal!
Leaving the treasury, Hu Mazi and the others gathered around!
Each of them was laden with spoils. Yun Wuya took out everything he had scavenged, not daring to keep a single thing for himself.
“I’m exhausted. If this continues, you won’t tire from killing, but we’ll be worn out from scavenging!”
Hu Mazi wiped the sweat from his forehead and said!
Chen Ping glanced at Mo Qingyun and Huo Jingjing. The two girls were slightly flushed, as scouring the vast Barbaric City with just a few of them was indeed too exhausting!
“Yun Wuya, send a signal to summon your Qingyun Sect disciples. There’ll be plenty more scavenging like this in the future, and relying on just a few of you is too tiring!”
After speaking, Chen Ping tossed over a thousand storage bags to Yun Wuya and said, “These resources are for you. Be obedient, and in the future, your Qingyun Sect will have a place in the Third Heaven!”
“Thank you, Mr. Chen, thank you, Mr. Chen! I’m willing to be your dog!” Yun Wuya was thrilled.
Yun Wuya hurriedly sent a message, notifying his Qingyun Sect disciples to come quickly!
“Let’s go…” Chen Ping knew it was time to head to the next destination!
But just as Chen Ping and the others were about to leave, the heavens and earth suddenly trembled violently. The blood-red setting sun was swallowed by dark clouds, and a grey-black mist rose from the ruins of the Barbarian King’s Palace.
Chen Ping felt a chilling, bone-piercing aura pierce through the clouds. The aura was not like the wildness of the ancient barbarian tribe but carried a precise, mechanical killing intent, as if countless lost souls were wailing in the mist.
“Be careful!”
Hu Mazi immediately shielded Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun behind him. The compass needle at his waist spun wildly, “This isn’t spiritual energy fluctuation… it’s soul malign Energy!”
Three black shadows coalesced from the mist, shaped like ink-stained human forms, their bodies wrapped in fine white chains of light, each chain tipped with a dim soul fire.
They didn’t glance at Chen Ping and the others, heading straight for the pile of barbarian ancient tribe cultivators’ corpses. Their withered fingers reached out into the air.
The lingering souls that had not yet dissipated were drawn as if by invisible threads, turning into specks of green light that flowed into the black gourds hanging from their sleeves.
Yun Wuya’s pupils shrank as he tugged at Chen Ping’s sleeve and whispered, “Mr. Chen, these three are probably from that mysterious organisation I told you about.”
The black-clad figures moved swiftly, collecting the souls from hundreds of corpses in the square in the blink of an eye.
One of them suddenly paused, his withered finger pointing towards the treasury deep within the Barbarian King’s Palace, “Residual soul aura is here.”
The three moved like shadows, entering the treasury, ignoring the scattered immortal stones and spiritual herbs, and heading straight to the stone tablet engraved with totems.
The leader in black pulled out a rusty bronze bell and gave it a gentle shake, “ding-ling.” The sound was soft, but it made the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord in Chen Ping’s consciousness curse loudly, “Damn it! It’s a ‘Soul-Locking Bell,’ an evil tool specifically for dealing with divine souls!”
The golden patterns on the stone tablet flickered violently, and the soul of the Barbarian Ancestor was forcibly pulled from the cracks in the stone by an invisible force, turning into a light orb struggling at the bell’s mouth.
