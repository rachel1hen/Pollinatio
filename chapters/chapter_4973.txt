Chen Ping was unaware that the person secretly controlling Feihu City was from the Temple, specifically the Temple’s Eighth Master, Huo Zhao.
Likewise, Huo Zhao had no idea that Chen Ping would be among those coming to negotiate. He might not even have guessed that Chen Ping could ascend the Heavenly Ladder so quickly to reach the Heavenly Realm.
At that moment, in the City Lord’s Mansion of Feihu City, Chen Ping, Bai Yi, and Mad Immortal did not rest. Instead, they gazed at the darkening night and quietly slipped out of their room.
“This City Lord’s Mansion is enormous. Where should we start looking for Niu Ben?” Bai Yi asked, frowning slightly.
“Father-in-law, I’ve already infused a trace of my aura into Niu Ben’s body. Now, I just need to sense that aura to locate him,” Chen Ping replied. He then slowly extended his divine sense, searching for the trace he had left in Niu Ben.
Soon, Chen Ping detected it and followed the aura’s guidance toward the mansion’s rear courtyard.
Although there were patrolling soldiers along the way, Chen Ping and his group managed to evade them.
Since the City Lord’s Mansion of Feihu City was situated among dozens of cities, no evildoers would dare infiltrate, and the patrolling soldiers had grown lax.
At a room in the rear courtyard, Chen Ping halted.
“Niu Ben is in there,” Chen Ping said, pointing at the room.
It seemed Niu Ben had not been mistreated. He wasn’t locked in a dungeon but confined in a room, which was relatively good treatment.
“I’ll go rescue him,” Mad Immortal said, eager to rush in and bring Niu Ben out.
But Chen Ping grabbed him, “Wait, let me check for any formations.”
Chen Ping crouched down slowly, drawing a strange rune on the ground with his hand. He then infused it with a burst of immortal energy.
Buzz…
As the rune glowed, the house in front of them began to shimmer as well.
Clearly, the room was enveloped by a formation. If Mad Immortal had recklessly charged in, it would have triggered the formation, and escape would have been impossible.
“Damn it, these guys are cautious. Setting up a formation in such a heavily guarded place!” Mad Immortal cursed.
Chen Ping said nothing. Observing the formation, he slowly pressed his palm against it.
He intended to forcefully break the formation rather than search for its core, as time was limited.
Golden light radiated from Chen Ping’s palm, and the formation around the house gradually dimmed until it vanished completely.
“Done,” Chen Ping said.
Mad Immortal rushed into the room and dragged Niu Ben out.
Niu Ben, startled and about to shout, immediately shut his mouth upon seeing Chen Ping.
“Don’t speak. Follow us, I’ll get you out,” Chen Ping said to Niu Ben.
Niu Ben’s eyes widened, and he nodded vigorously.
Chen Ping and his group began escorting Niu Ben out of the City Lord’s Mansion.
But just as they left the rear courtyard, they ran straight into Li Tianbao.
Li Tianbao had come to deliver supplies to Niu Ben, not wanting him to suffer.
After all, Li Tianbao had spent many years in Rhinoceros City, where Niu Ben had treated him well, even appointing him as the manager of Tianbao Pavilion.
However, as a native of Feihu City, Li Tianbao knew his duty and had no choice.
When Li Tianbao collided with Chen Ping’s group, both sides froze in shock.
Chen Ping, quick to react, struck at Li Tianbao with a palm.
He needed to knock Li Tianbao out before he could raise the alarm, or escaping with Niu Ben would be nearly impossible.
Li Tianbao instinctively moved to counter, but for some reason, he withdrew his hand, allowing Chen Ping’s palm to strike his chest heavily.
Li Tianbao was sent flying, his head lolling as he fell unconscious.
