But at that moment, the real Chen Ping appeared behind him, the Demon-Whipping Lash coiling around You Wuji’s neck!
“Get down!” Chen Ping shouted, yanking hard.
Caught off guard, You Wuji stumbled, a sharp pain and numbness shooting through his neck.
He hurriedly channelled his energy to shake off the Demon-Whipping Lash, only to find the righteous energy on the whip clinging like a parasite, eroding his meridians.
“Now’s the time!”
A glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes. He clenched his left fist, gathering all his strength into it, and smashed it fiercely into You Wuji’s back!
“Bang!”
The punch landed squarely, and You Wuji let out a muffled groan, his body trembling violently as he spat out a mouthful of black blood.
“Not bad, kid, that’s something!”
Nan Batian, watching from the side, nodded repeatedly, a smile of approval on his face.
He could tell that Chen Ping’s combat skills and control of power far surpassed monks of the same rank, even outshining some early-stage Earth Immortal cultivators.
Hit repeatedly, You Wuji was consumed by rage.
Abandoning defence, his black fiend demonic energy surged wildly, his entire body shrouded in thick black mist, with only a pair of blood-red eyes visible.
“You little bastard, I’ll make your soul vanish!”
From the black mist, countless black ghost claws extended, rushing towards Chen Ping like a tide.
This was You Wuji’s ultimate technique—Ten Thousand Ghosts Devouring Soul. Once caught by these claws, not only would the body be torn apart, but the soul would also be devoured.
Chen Ping’s expression changed; he could sense the terrifying power within these claws and knew he couldn’t take them head-on.
“Move!”
Deciding instantly, Chen Ping disengaged, retreating swiftly while shouting.
He knew he was just sparring, and getting injured by You Wuji would outweigh the gains!
With Nan Batian present, Chen Ping only needed to warm up!
“Been waiting for you to say that!”
Nan Batian laughed heartily, his figure appearing in front of Chen Ping like a phantom.
Without using any treasures, he casually raised his right hand and slapped towards the black mist.
The seemingly ordinary palm carried an irresistible pressure.
As the palm wind passed, the black ghost claws melted like snow in sunlight, and the thick black mist dissipated into nothing.
“Pfft!”
You Wuji’s figure was exposed. Looking at Nan Batian’s incoming palm, his eyes filled with fear and despair. He tried to dodge but found himself locked by an invisible force, unable to move.
“Thud!”
Nan Batian’s palm struck You Wuji’s chest squarely.
No earth-shattering roar, just a dull thud.
You Wuji’s body flew back like a broken kite, crashing heavily into a pillar in the hall and sliding to the ground.
A clear palm print marked his chest, the bones beneath his black robe shattered inch by inch, black blood pouring from his mouth, his eyes rapidly losing focus.
You Wuji, a fifth-rank Earth Immortal, couldn’t withstand even a single move from Nan Batian!
Nan Batian clapped his hands, sneering, “Fifth-rank Earth Immortal? Daring to act arrogant in front of me? Truly courting death.”
Despair flickered in You Wuji’s eyes; he knew he was defeated.
His opponent’s strength was far beyond his, leaving him no chance of victory!
At that moment, Chen Ping stepped forward, looking coldly at You Wuji and Youyue, “Now, it’s time to settle the score.”
“You Wuji, I ask you: was the extermination of the Hu Clan back then the work of your Black Fiend Demon Palace?” Chen Ping asked icily.
You Wuji was silent for a moment, then gave a bitter smile, “At this point, there’s no need to hide it. Yes, our Black Fiend Demon Palace was indeed involved in the Hu Clan’s destruction.”
Hearing this, Hu Mazi grew agitated, “Why? Our Hu Clan had no grudge with you; why did you do this?”
