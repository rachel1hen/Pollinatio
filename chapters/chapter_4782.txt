“Why did Mr. Shi only kill the Ninth Hall Master and spare you?”
Chen Ping asked curiously!
“That Ninth Hall Master talked too much, said he’d beat the shit out of the powerhouse behind you, that’s what ticked off Mr. Shi, so he snuffed him out.”
The Tenth Hall Master answered honestly!
Chen Ping burst out laughing, seems Mr. Shi’s got a bit of a temper!
“Are you genuinely submitting, or just scared stiff by Mr. Shi’s pressure?” Chen Ping pressed!
“Genuine, I’m dead serious, I hope Mr. Chen will give me a chance to serve!”
The Tenth Hall Master rushed to pledge his loyalty!
“Aren’t you godkin all high and mighty, looking down on other races? Submitting to me now, doesn’t that clash with your godkin pride?”
Chen Ping asked!
“Sigh…” The Tenth Hall Master gave an awkward chuckle, “Godkin? It’s just self-delusion, how’s our bloodline any nobler than others?”
“On the contrary, all those godkin rules hold us back, to boost my strength, I secretly fused beast clan blood, can’t just stagnate, can we?”
“If not for those bloody rules, my son Yun Li’d be married off by now, no need to end up dead and broken!”
Thinking of Yun Li, the Tenth Hall Master felt a pang of guilt, all thanks to godkin nonsense!
“My strength’s still below yours, you sure you want to follow me?”
Chen Ping eyed the Tenth Hall Master, asking again!
The Tenth Hall Master said, “I believe Mr. Chen will one day rule the Celestial Human Realm, after all, you’re a heaven-sent genius, brimming with talent, blessed beyond measure, always rising, sky’s the…”
Chen Ping cut him off with a wave, “Alright, enough flattery, just say you’re scared of dying.”
“But since you’re with me now, you’re my underling, I can’t just take all these resources for nothing, I’ll give you a gift too!”
“What gift?” The Tenth Hall Master’s face lit up with anticipation!
He wondered what rare treasure Chen Ping might offer!
“Come with me…” Chen Ping beckoned!
The Tenth Hall Master stepped forward, then hesitated, not daring to cross into Xiao Dynasty territory!
Chen Ping grinned, “Relax, it’s fine, as long as you’ve got no ill intent, you won’t get attacked!”
Only then did the Tenth Hall Master step in, following Chen Ping into the royal city!
Chen Ping took him straight to where Yun Li stayed!
Now that the Tenth Hall Master was his lackey, it was time for father and son to reunite!
Yun Li was dual-cultivating with Shi Lan in their room, Chen Ping called him out!
“Chen Ping, you git, why’re you interrupting my fun? I never bothered you during your sessions!”
Yun Li stormed out, dressing as he went, fuming!
But as he stepped out, he froze, seeing his father there too!
Yun Li stood stunned, the Tenth Hall Master’s face mirrored shock, then tears of joy!
“Yun Li, my boy, I thought you were dead…”
The Tenth Hall Master rushed forward, hugging him!
Yun Li resisted, his expression flustered, frowning at Chen Ping!
He couldn’t fathom why Chen Ping brought his father here, Yun Li had faked his death to escape the godkin and the Tenth Hall!
He’d finally tricked his dad, and now Chen Ping dragged him back!
“Brother Yun, your father knows he screwed up, he won’t stop you and Shi Lan cultivating anymore, and he’s my underling now.”
Chen Ping explained to Yun Li!
“What rubbish are you spouting, who’s your underling?”
Yun Li bristled, how could Chen Ping call his father that!
“Yun Li, don’t be rude to Mr. Chen, I’m truly following him now!”
The Tenth Hall Master quickly scolded his son!
