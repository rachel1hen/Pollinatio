“The power of the Heavenly Dao from a mere Golden Immortal is nothing to worry about…”
Chen Ping said calmly.
Li Chunfeng stared at Chen Ping in shock, unable to believe his ears, and exclaimed, “Fellow Daoist, you’re not just bragging, are you?”
For a cultivator at the third rank of the Great Ascension Realm to claim that the Heavenly Dao power of a Golden Immortal was no big deal—what else could this be but hot air?
“Old Li, what nonsense are you spouting? How could Mr. Chen possibly be bragging?”
“The Heavenly Dao power of a Golden Immortal doesn’t even need Mr. Chen to lift a finger. That little pet he keeps could shatter it with ease!”
Nan Batian declared.
“Is that really true?”
Li Chunfeng frowned, still struggling to believe it.
Chen Ping didn’t waste words. He moved straight to break the imprisonment seal on Li Chunfeng.
“Kid, have you thought this through? My Heaven-Devouring Beast doesn’t just pop out whenever I want it to.”
“If heavenly punishment comes down and the beast doesn’t show, can you handle it on your own?”
The Red Cloud Demon Lord asked.
Chen Ping paused at those words, hesitating for a moment.
“Mr. Chen, Old Li doesn’t believe you. Break it for him and show him…”
Nan Batian urged.
“I’m still not convinced…” Li Chunfeng muttered.
“Let’s take a chance!”
With that, Chen Ping pressed his palm to the ground. Instantly, the Great Dao imprisonment seal appeared, its crimson patterns flowing with Li Chunfeng’s blood.
Using the same method, Chen Ping shattered the seal binding Li Chunfeng.
Li Chunfeng felt a surge of power vanish from his body. Probing with his divine sense, he confirmed the seal within him was gone!
“It’s really broken, it’s really broken! I’m free too!”
Li Chunfeng leapt up in joy, like a child.
He’d thought he’d be trapped in this place for life, never imagining he’d break free.
To him, this was an incredible stroke of fortune!
“Thank you, Mr. Chen…”
Li Chunfeng bowed deeply to Chen Ping with utmost respect.
“No need to be so polite, Senior. I’ve given you freedom, and in return, you’ll serve me for three hundred years. It’s a fair trade!”
Chen Ping said.
Li Chunfeng shook his head, “Even serving Mr. Chen for three hundred years calls for gratitude. You’re practically like a second set of parents to me.”
“Senior, you’re too kind!” Chen Ping waved it off hastily, then asked, “Senior, are you like Senior Nan Batian, with your strength sealed away too?”
“Yes, my current strength is less than a third of what it was at my peak. Back in my prime, even with your exceptional talent, Mr. Chen, you wouldn’t have withstood a single strike of my sword.”
Li Chunfeng replied.
Chen Ping’s eyes lit up with excitement. These were some seriously impressive immortals! Once they regained their full power, he’d be able to strut through the Heavenly Realm without fear of being pushed around!
He couldn’t keep relying on Master Shi forever—he needed his own faction!
Though he hadn’t yet ascended to the Heavenly Realm, Chen Ping already had a solid lineup of allies and helpers there!
Several great demon lords, Wuji Daoist, the Divine Pattern Ancestor, the Array Demon, plus Nan Batian and Li Chunfeng…
These were all Heavenly Realm figures, set to return once the great Heaven-Earth Formation vanished!
The more Chen Ping thought about it, the more thrilled he became!
But just then, the earth trembled, and a terrifying force descended from the sky!
“Mr. Chen, watch out! Heavenly punishment is here…”
Li Chunfeng shouted in warning!
Everyone else scrambled back. This was the Heavenly Dao power of a Golden Immortal—none of them dared face it!
Seeing this, Chen Ping activated his Indestructible Golden Body, layers of spiritual energy shielding him as he silently chanted, “Come on, little Heaven-Devouring Beast, come out, Heaven-Devouring Beast…”
But the more anxious he grew, the less the beast stirred!
As the Heavenly Dao power bore down, about to strike him, Chen Ping shut his eyes tight, gritted his teeth, and braced himself for the gamble!
