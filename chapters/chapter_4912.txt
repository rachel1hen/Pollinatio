They hadn’t expected that these two were the princess and prince of Rhinoceros City!
Did that mean their parents were the city lords of Rhinoceros City?
Niu Li gently waved her hand, and a soft white light enveloped the guards.
“Thank you, Princess!”
The guards visibly became excited and happy, then quickly opened the city gates!
As Niu Li and Niu Ben entered the city, Chen Ping and his group followed behind but were stopped by a guard.
“Halt! Who are you three, and where are you from?” the guard asked cautiously, eyeing Chen Ping and his companions.
“We’re also from the Beast Clan, just here to have a look around,” Chen Ping replied.
“I know you’re from the Beast Clan, but without a passage token, you can’t enter!” the guard said, blocking their way.
Before Chen Ping could respond, Niu Li, who had already entered, turned back and said, “They’re my friends, let them in!”
Hearing this, the guard immediately stepped aside, his face full of apologies, “I’m terribly sorry, I didn’t know you were friends of the Princess!”
“Bloody hell, looking down on us!” Hu Mazi muttered under his breath, glaring at the guard.
The guard could only listen, maintaining a forced smile, as they didn’t dare offend the Princess’s friends!
Following Niu Li and her brother into the city, Niu Li handed Chen Ping a small token and said, “You can wander around the city for now. I need to take my brother home and let our parents know, or they’ll definitely worry!”
“This token can be used for communication and tracking. I’ll know where you are, and I’ll find you later!”
Chen Ping nodded, took the token, and examined it closely, noticing nothing particularly special about it.
The only difference was that the token contained a trace of immortal energy!
After Niu Li and her brother left, Chen Ping led Hu Mazi and Xiu Rui to explore the city!
Looking at the bustling streets, Chen Ping realised that the cities of the Heavenly Realm weren’t much different from those in the Human Realm. The streets were lined with various shops!
Sure enough, in the city, Chen Ping spotted several cultivators at the Immortal Transformation Realm, clearly those brought here by the Great Dao!
However, cultivators like Chen Ping, at the first rank of the Immortal Transformation Realm, were extremely rare!
The weakest cultivators they encountered were at the eighth rank of the Immortal Transformation Realm, as it took considerable strength to be brought here by the Great Dao!
“This Heavenly Realm doesn’t seem as great as I imagined,” Chen Ping remarked with a sigh.
Countless people had fought desperately to ascend to the Heavenly Realm, cultivating relentlessly, even abandoning their families and seizing resources!
All just to ascend to the Heavenly Realm!
But now that Chen Ping and his group were here, they found the Heavenly Realm wasn’t as wonderful as they’d thought!
While Chen Ping, Hu Mazi, and Xiu Rui were strolling around, they suddenly noticed a large stage ahead, surrounded by a crowd, with shouts and cheers filling the air!
“What’s going on up there? It’s not a circus, is it?” Hu Mazi asked curiously.
Chen Ping rolled his eyes at Hu Mazi and said, “Master Hu, can you use your brain? This is the Beast Realm, full of Beast Clan members. Would they set up a circus?”
The people here were all from the Beast Clan, originally various animals who had taken human form through cultivation!
Would they, now in human form, put on animal performances?
Was that even possible?
“Let’s go take a look. Maybe it’s a striptease!” Xiu Rui said, eyeing the lively crowd ahead.
“Friend Xiu, does your Wuxu Realm have stripteases too?” Chen Ping asked curiously.
“Of course! Those striptease dancers are quite impressive. After all, their way of earning resources is simple.”
“They dance, shake their hips, and they’ve got resources. I’m so jealous I almost want to turn into a woman!” Xiu Rui said.
Chen Ping chuckled at this. In some ways, women did have advantages over men!
“Come on, let’s go see what’s so exciting!” Chen Ping said, leading Hu Mazi and Xiu Rui towards the stage.
