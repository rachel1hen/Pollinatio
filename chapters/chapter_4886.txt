“Ancestor, Ancestor, save me, you’ve finally come!”
Seeing Wen Haotian, Wen Nanxing’s eyes instantly lit up, and he shouted loudly!
“My Ancestor is here, you’re all dead now…”
“Hahaha…”
Wen Nanxing laughed maniacally, the humiliation he’d just endured, he’d make them pay back double!
“Shut up, I can’t save you!”
Wen Haotian said calmly!
Wen Nanxing froze, his face full of disbelief, “Ancestor, why not?”
“Because I’m no match for him!”
Wen Haotian looked at Mr. Shi!
“You’ve got some self-awareness…” Mr. Shi smiled at Wen Haotian!
“If I’d had a bit more time, and this Heaven and Earth Array had activated, it’d be hard to say who’d come out on top.”
“Unfortunately, the timing isn’t right yet, I can only keep waiting!”
With that, Wen Haotian’s figure slowly faded, along with the bronze coffin!
Mr. Shi watched but didn’t pursue, letting Wen Haotian leave!
“Mr. Shi, why not chase him?”
Chen Ping couldn’t understand why Mr. Shi just let Wen Haotian go!
“Don’t pursue a desperate foe, even if I caught up to him, with the Heaven and Earth Array open now, he can slip away freely, it’d be pointless!”
Mr. Shi shook his head!
Wen Nanxing watched Wen Haotian vanish, and finally, his heart died, completely!
Even as Chen Ping took the storage pouch from him, Wen Nanxing didn’t react at all!
With his heart dead, it was no different from being reduced to ashes!
Looking at Wen Nanxing’s storage pouch, Chen Ping grinned ear to ear, what a haul!
“Mr. Shi, can you heal Senior Mu Sha?”
Chen Ping pointed at the gravely injured, barely breathing Mu Sha!
Mr. Shi didn’t speak, just brushed his hand lightly, and Mu Sha felt his body surge with strength, leaping up in an instant!
Seeing his body fully restored, Mu Sha was overjoyed, then dropped to his knees before Mr. Shi!
“Please, Senior, save my wife!”
Mu Sha brought out his wife’s body!
Preserved all this time, her form was lifelike, her flesh showing no signs of decay!
“Mr. Shi, Senior Mu Sha’s wife has been dead for a thousand years, can you still bring her back?”
Chen Ping asked Mr. Shi!
Mr. Shi looked at the corpse, frowning slightly, “Dead for a thousand years, she’s likely already reincarnated.”
“I can only check, if her soul hasn’t reincarnated yet, I can summon it back from the underworld!”
With that, Mr. Shi waved his hand over the body, and the heavens trembled as a strange passage opened before them!
From that passage came chilling wails, as if from the depths of hell!
Everyone stared, dumbfounded, they’d never seen such a sight, nor heard such haunting cries!
These were the true sounds of the underworld!
Soon, a soul form slowly emerged from the passage, Mu Sha looked at it, so overwhelmed with emotion he could barely speak!
It was his wife, her soul!
In just a few breaths, someone dead for a millennium slowly opened her eyes!
“Wife, wife…”
Mu Sha rushed forward, clutching her tightly!
“Husband, where are we?”
To Mu Sha’s wife, the thousand years felt like a nap!
Mu Sha was too choked up to speak!
“A thousand years without reincarnating, that’s true love!”
Mr. Shi looked at the couple, his eyes tinged with envy!
Seeing that look, Chen Ping curiously leaned in, “Mr. Shi, do… do you have a wife?”
Mr. Shi glared at him, “For a cultivator, how can one be bound by emotions? That’s called a dual cultivation partner, someone you join with to boost your cultivation!”
“You, on the other hand, leaving your charm everywhere, wasting your energy on women, no wonder your strength progresses so slowly!”
