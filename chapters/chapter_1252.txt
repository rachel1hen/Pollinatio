Although Ji Ru Xue was a little puzzled, she could not be rude when the other party was so polite.
“Elder Xiao is polite, it is a blessing for our Red Lotus Palace that you can come to us!”
“Look at the seats, serve tea ……”
Ji Ru Xue finished speaking and sat down on a chair.
Someone immediately brought a chair for Xiao Da and served a cup of tea!
“Palace Master Ji, let’s not speak in the dark, what about my coming here this time, I am here on the order of our Palace Master, for the matter of Xiang Chong.”
Xiao Da said straightforwardly.
Once Ji Ru Xue heard this, she knew that the other party had indeed come for this matter.
“Elder Xiao, that Xiang Chong was killed by our Red Lotus Palace, if you are here to take revenge for that Xiang Chong, just do it directly.”
Ji Ru Xue’s aura began to rise, ready to strike at any moment.
Seeing this, Xiao Da hurriedly waved his hand, “Palace Master Ji has misunderstood, I am not here to avenge that Xiang Chong.”
“That Xiang Chong has the nerve to plot against Palace Master Ji, he deserves to die ……”
“I have come this time to make amends to Palace Master Ji, our Palace Master has said that it was his poor discipline that allowed that Xiang Chong to do such a nasty thing.”
Xiao Da’s words caused Ji Ru Xue to freeze for a moment.
She didn’t even know what to say after that, it followed what she thought was completely different!
Ji Ru Xue knew too well what kind of person the Sacred Beast Palace Master Fei Qingping was, and would not even do something like taking the initiative to admit his mistakes and make amends.
Moreover, as the number one sect in the south, there was no need for Fei Qingping to make amends with anyone else.
But now he was actually looking for someone to come and make amends with the Red Lotus Palace.
This made Ji Ru Xue wonder what kind of medicine this Sacred Beast Palace was selling in its gourd.
“Elder Xiao, if you have something to say, just say it directly, you are making me a bit unsure of what to say by saying this.”
Ji Ru Xue felt that the Sacred Beast Palace must have something up its sleeve, so she hoped that Xiao Da would speak up.
Seeing Ji Ru Xue’s look, Xiao Da laughed, “Palace Master Ji, I am indeed here to make amends this time, but there is one more thing, and that is to invite Chen Ping, to the Sacred Beast Palace for a seat!”
“When our Palace Master knew that Chen Ping had come to the south and was in your Red Lotus Palace, he immediately sent me to invite him, our Palace Master admires Chen Ping very much.”
As soon as Ji Ru Xue heard this, she immediately understood that the Sacred Beast Palace had come over to make amends, so it was for Chen Ping.
If Chen Ping was not in the Red Lotus Palace, then the Sacred Beast Palace would definitely not be so polite.
It seemed that it should be because the Sacred Beast Palace was also a little afraid of Chen Ping’s reputation, and after knowing that Xiang Chong had been killed by Chen Ping, they did not dare to strike at Chen Ping.
After all, Chen Ping also had his own forces in Kyoto, and besides, the official Shi of Kyoto, who followed Chen Ping with a close relationship, had stepped in to help Chen Ping many times.
“Elder Xiao, you came too unfortunate, Mr. Chen is cultivating, it is not good for me to disturb ……”
Ji Ru Xue said somewhat apologetically.
“Cultivating?” Xiao Da frowned slightly, “Then I wonder how long it will take for Chen Ping to come out of his training?”
“I can’t say that, but it shouldn’t take more than a few days!”
The time Chen Ping had given Ji Ru Xue was ten days, and now it was three days later, so Chen Ping would come out in a few days.
“Alright then, I’ll come and invite him in a few days!”
Xiao Da got up and after giving a salute to Ji Ru Xue, he turned around and left.
With Xiao Da gone, everyone in the Red Lotus Palace became excited, as long as the Sacred Beast Palace did not make a move against them anymore, they could stay in the Red Lotus Palace in peace.
Ji Ruxue was also relieved and fell back to sleep.
This time, Ji Ru Xue slept for two days and two nights!
And during these two days and nights, Chen Ping kept on pounding and pounding.
But he just couldn’t break through that barrier, couldn’t reach the Martial Marquis realm, couldn’t form a YuanYing in his body! Ji Ru Xue was a little puzzled, but she could not be rude even though the other party was so polite.
