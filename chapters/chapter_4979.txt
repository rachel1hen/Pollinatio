Because Chen Ping discovered that this youth surprisingly lacked the aura of the beast clan.
Even Mad Immortal and Bai Yi were full of astonishment.
The youth actually carried the aura of the human clan. How could a human youth suddenly appear in the beast clan’s territory?
Moreover, it seemed his status was quite noble.
Could it be that Xie Zhong of Flying Tiger City had already submitted to the human clan?
“Just a few small fry, no need for interrogation, just kill them…”
The youth’s eyes were full of disdain, as if killing Chen Ping and the others was simpler than crushing ants.
“Yes!” The captain of the battle soldiers nodded, then ordered, “Kill them…”
But just as those battle soldiers were about to make a move against Chen Ping and his group!
Suddenly, a white light flashed beneath their feet!
Everyone felt their vision go dark, and when they looked again, they found that Chen Ping and the other three had vanished.
They were clearly right in front of them, surrounded on all sides, yet they had suddenly disappeared.
The captain’s face instantly turned extremely grim!
His divine sense spread out, but he could no longer detect any trace of Chen Ping and the others, as if they had vanished into thin air!
“Quickly, find them, go search…”
The captain, as if suffering a great humiliation, ordered the battle soldiers to search for Chen Ping and his group!
Meanwhile, the youth slightly furrowed his brow, a hint of surprise finally appearing in his eyes!
“No need to search…”
The youth walked to where Chen Ping had stood, looking down at the runes on the ground.
“They’ve already left through a teleportation array. I didn’t expect that among these unremarkable fellows, there was actually a master of arrays hidden.”
“He could silently set up a teleportation array without anyone noticing.”
The youth was now very interested in Chen Ping.
The captain stepped forward, took a look, and then said, “Young Master, this kind of small-scale teleportation array can’t transport them far. They must have already set up another teleportation array nearby. If we pursue them now, we might still catch up.”
“Hmm, go after them, but remember to capture them alive. Such talents might be useful to us!”
The youth nodded!
“Understood…” The captain immediately led tens of thousands of battle soldiers, beginning a massive search in the surrounding area.
Meanwhile, Chen Ping and his group had already returned to their original resting place. It turned out Chen Ping had set up a temporary teleportation array there in advance.
If they encountered real danger, they could activate this temporary array to teleport back.
Fortunately, Chen Ping had made thorough preparations, otherwise they might all have been captured by now!
“Big brother, you actually prepared a teleportation array in advance, truly foresightful!”
Mad Immortal praised Chen Ping!
Bai Yi, however, frowned, his face full of disbelief, “How could there be a human in Flying Tiger City? And it seems their status is quite high?”
“Could Flying Tiger City have defected to the human clan?” Chen Ping said!
“Absolutely impossible. In this First Heaven, the human clan’s forces are the weakest. How could Xie Zhong be foolish enough to defect to the human clan?”
Bai Yi shook his head.
“Who cares? Let’s just figure out how to get out of here!” Mad Immortal said!
“I’m afraid we have no way out now.” After scanning with his divine sense, Chen Ping said gravely!
He discovered that tens of thousands of battle soldiers were conducting a large-scale manhunt for them, and returning the way they came was impossible, as Xie Zhong was surely also searching for them with his troops.
Now, Chen Ping and his group were truly like fish trapped in a net…
“My son-in-law, I’ll go draw those battle soldiers away. You take the chance to escape. If we stay together, none of us will get away!”
Bai Yi said to Chen Ping!
“Father-in-law, no need to be so pessimistic yet. There might be other ways.”
Chen Ping said!
“What other ways could there be?” Bai Yi asked!
“There are tens of thousands of battle soldiers searching for us. We can blend into their ranks. As long as we hide our auras well, we won’t be discovered.”
Chen Ping said!
