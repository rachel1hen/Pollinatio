Chen Ping only then realised that the direction the two warrior statues were heading was indeed towards the Asura Hall!
But why the two warrior statues suddenly went to the Asura Hall, Chen Ping was somewhat baffled!
At that moment, a dishevelled figure suddenly burst out from the clouds ahead.
The person was dressed in blood-red attire, holding a short blade that continuously oozed blood, it was Sang Lan.
Her hair was disarrayed, blood stained the corner of her mouth, clearly having gone through a fierce battle, and now she was being pursued by several streaks of black light.
“Sang Lan!”
Chen Ping’s pupils contracted, and with a raise of his hand, he unleashed a cyan sword qi.
The sword qi tore through the void like a bolt of silk, precisely striking the wrist of a black-robed cultivator, who let out a scream as the bone whip in his hand shattered inch by inch.
“Chen… Mr. Chen?”
Sang Lan abruptly turned her head, and the moment she saw Chen Ping, her eyes burst with ecstatic light, but it was quickly overshadowed by despair, “Quick! The Asura Hall… Father, he…”
Before she could finish, three more black-robed cultivators surrounded her, their eyes gleaming with bloodthirsty red light, each move a killing strike.
Chen Ping let out a cold snort, and with a flash of the Dragon-Slaying Sword, golden sword qi swept out, instantly cutting down the three black-robed figures!
“Talk as we move!” Chen Ping grabbed Sang Lan, “What exactly happened?”
Gasping for breath, Sang Lan pointed to a distant area shrouded in blood-red mist, her voice trembling, “The Master of Tianyuan Pavilion… he’s been controlled by a blood corpse and is leading an attack on the Asura Hall! Father burned his essence blood to let me come find you…”
She choked back sobs, the blood threads on her Blood Weeping Blade pulsing even more violently, “They want to seize the Asura Blood Crystal, the protective array of the hall has already been broken!”
Chen Ping’s heart sank.
A blood corpse?
Chen Ping recalled the two coffins, it seemed the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion had opened them!
“Let’s go…”
Knowing there was no time to waste, Chen Ping immediately rushed towards the Asura Hall!
…
Asura Hall!
At this moment, all the protective arrays of the Asura Hall had been shattered, countless fragments of light screens fell from the sky, and blood qi permeated the surroundings as screams rose and fell!
The entire Asura Hall had truly become an infernal purgatory!
The Master of Tianyuan Pavilion hovered in mid-air, his eyes filled with disdain and arrogance!
In the scene, everyone from the Asura Hall was filled with despair!
Sang Tianyang, as the Hall Master of the Asura Hall, now stared blankly at the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion in the void!
Around him lay the corpses of countless Asura Hall powerhouses.
And Sang Tianyang himself had lost both arms, gravely injured.
The Asura Hall now was no match for Tianyuan Pavilion, even if the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion fought alone, the Asura Hall would still not stand a chance!
Sang Tianyang had burned his essence blood, reaching the eighth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, but in front of the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion, it was still not enough!
At this moment, the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion looked down at the Asura Hall and said coldly, “Hand over the Asura Blood Crystal, and I might spare your life!”
Sang Tianyang now finally understood why the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion wanted the Asura Blood Crystal!
Because the Asura Blood Crystal could replace a heart, allowing the blood corpse to be revived!
Now, controlled by the blood corpse, the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion’s first thought was to seize the Asura Blood Crystal.
“The Asura Blood Crystal is the foundation of our Asura Hall, if I give it to you, the Asura Hall will cease to exist!”
Though Sang Tianyang had lost both arms, his face was still filled with cold killing intent, showing no fear!
He could die, but the Asura Blood Crystal could not be handed over!
If he died, it would only mean the loss of a Hall Master, the Asura Hall could still elect a new one!
But if the Asura Blood Crystal was given up, the foundation of the Asura Hall would be gone, and the Asura Hall would dissolve!
“If you don’t hand over the Asura Blood Crystal, your Asura Hall will still disappear!”
The Master of Tianyuan Pavilion declared!
“I haven’t lost yet…”
After saying this, Sang Tianyang suddenly spat out a mouthful of essence blood, and an ancient token began to appear in the void, emitting a radiant light.
Under the illumination of the light, the earth began to tremble, then slowly cracked open with fissures!
