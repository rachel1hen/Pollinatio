“Get out of the way! I am Qin Feng, the young master of Divine Sword Manor, and I want to see Chen Ping of your Sword Sect!”
An arrogant voice rang out, accompanied by the angry shouts of disciples and the clashing of weapons.
Chen Ping’s eyes sharpened; he and Ling Xue stood up at the same time.
At the courtyard gate, a youth dressed in a brocade robe was kicking aside two Sword Sect disciples. This person was none other than Qin Feng, the young master of Divine Sword Manor.
Behind him followed more than ten black-clothed guards; each had a condensed aura, clearly all experts in the Earth Immortal Realm.
Qin Feng had heard that both Chen Ping and Mo Chen were seriously injured, so he dared to bring people to the Sword Sect’s residence to act arrogantly.
“Where is Chen Ping? Is he a shrinking turtle?”
Qin Feng scanned the surroundings; his gaze fell on Chen Ping who was hurrying over. The corner of his mouth curled into a mocking smile. “I thought you were already dead. I heard you were hurt badly this time?”
“You闯 into my Sword Sect’s residence; what is the matter?” Chen Ping blocked in front of Ling Xue; the spiritual power in his body quietly circulated.
He could feel that this Qin Feng seemingly only had the cultivation of the fourth grade of the Earth Immortal Realm, but the sword intent on his body was exceptionally sharp. Clearly, he had unique attainments in swordsmanship.
Qin Feng’s gaze passed over Chen Ping and landed on Ling Xue; a trace of coldness flashed in his eyes: “Ling Xue, you and I have never decided a winner. I wonder if you dare to compete with me today?”
“He will not compete with you!” Chen Ping said.
Qin Feng looked Chen Ping up and down, as if looking at an ant. “You are seriously injured and almost died; do you have the right to speak here? You killed Zhao Jingfeng of our Divine Sword Manor; I have not settled the score with you yet.”
“Zhao Jingfeng was killed by me; if you want to settle the score, come at me anytime.” Chen Ping’s tone was ice-cold. “As for whether you can kill me for revenge, that depends on your ability, kid.”
“What a sharp tongue!”
Qin Feng laughed in extreme anger. “Today, I will not argue with you verbally.”
“Today, no one from your Sword Sect can escape. However, if you want me not to make a move, Ling Xue can strip naked and dance for me; then I will let you go today.”
As soon as these words came out, all the Sword Sect disciples glared angrily; Mo Chen and Hu Mazi also hurried over with crutches.
“Qin Feng! You must not be so presumptuous!” Mo Chen trembled with anger all over. “Although my Sword Sect is weak, we will not tolerate such humiliation from you!”
“Humiliation?”
Qin Feng sneered. “If you know what is good for you, obediently let Ling Xue strip and dance; otherwise, today I will raze this dilapidated courtyard to the ground!”
The guards behind him simultaneously released their auras; the pressure of the Earth Immortal Realm enveloped like dark clouds. The Sword Sect disciples with weaker cultivation immediately turned pale.
Chen Ping stepped forward; the evil qi and divine dragon power in his body erupted simultaneously, forcibly tearing a gap in that pressure: “Do you want to die?”
“Just you?”
Murderous intent surged in Qin Feng’s eyes. “Zhao Jingfeng was careless and you got lucky; do you really think you are invincible?”
He slowly drew the long sword at his waist; the sword body flowed with a faint blue radiance. “Today, I will let you see what the true swordsmanship of Divine Sword Manor is!”
When the sword was not yet unsheathed, Qin Feng was still restrained. But the moment the long sword left the sheath, a sharp sword qi directly aimed at Chen Ping’s face.
This sword qi contained threads of chilling ice power; wherever it passed, the air condensed into fine ice crystals.
“Cold Ice Sword Technique?”
Mo Chen’s face changed slightly. “This is one of the ultimate arts of Divine Sword Manor; it is said that when cultivated to the extreme, it can freeze a cultivator’s spiritual power circulation!”
Chen Ping, however, remained unmoved; the Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand trembled slightly, as if already eager to drink blood.
He could feel that although the opponent’s sword technique was exquisite, it lacked a forward momentum. It was inferior even to Li Hanjiang, let alone compared to Zhao Jingfeng.
“If you want to fight, then fight; where does all this nonsense come from!” Chen Ping let out a low shout; the Dragon-Slaying Sword turned into a golden ray, stabbing straight at Qin Feng’s chest.
Qin Feng obviously did not expect Chen Ping to dare to take the initiative; in his haste, he raised his sword horizontally to block.
