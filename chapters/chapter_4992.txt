Upon hearing this, Prince Huo’s eyes widened, staring at Chen Ping in disbelief, “You… you’re from the Celestial Realm?”
“Correct,” Chen Ping nodded.
At this, Prince Huo’s expression turned utterly grim, likely because he had heard something from his father, Huo Zhao.
“You can leave, I’ll pretend I saw nothing,” Prince Huo said, swallowing his pride and actually offering to let Chen Ping and his group go.
“I suddenly don’t feel like leaving,” Chen Ping replied.
“What do you want?” Prince Huo asked, a hint of panic in his voice.
“With so many cities in Flying Tiger City, even if I leave this one, getting out of the Flying Tiger City region will still involve plenty of obstacles.”
“So, I want you to escort us out of Flying Tiger City,” Chen Ping stated.
“Hmph, in your dreams…” Prince Huo scoffed, then turned and fled!
“Trying to run?” Chen Ping sneered, pointing his right hand, a golden beam shooting straight at Prince Huo.
The Immortal Finger, now that Chen Ping had reached the Loose Immortal Realm and was filled with immortal energy, flowed far more smoothly.
With a scream, Prince Huo plummeted from mid-air, crashing heavily to the ground!
“Damn it…” Prince Huo gritted his teeth, summoning all his strength to fight Chen Ping.
But he suddenly realized his body felt bound, as if restrained.
Unbeknownst to him, Chen Ping’s seemingly casual finger strike was an immortal technique, infused with a hefty dose of time laws.
Pfft…
Because his body was restrained, Prince Huo forcibly tried to channel his immortal energy.
Unable to release it, the energy exploded within him!
His face contorted, blood spewed from his mouth.
Feces and urine flowed uncontrollably, his body no longer his own.
At that moment, Prince Huo’s eyes widened, staring at Chen Ping in terror.
“Bloody hell, that stinks…” Mad Immortal quickly covered his nose.
Even the soldiers accompanying Prince Huo shuffled a few steps away.
It was just too foul.
In that moment, Prince Huo felt the ultimate humiliation.
He was a God Clan member, the son of the Eighth Hall Master of the Temple.
“What are you lot standing there for? Get them, kill them…” Prince Huo roared at his soldiers.
The soldiers exchanged glances, then gritted their teeth and charged at Chen Ping’s group!
Chen Ping didn’t even glance at the soldiers, walking straight towards Prince Huo.
Mad Immortal and Bai Yi leaped into action, engaging the soldiers.
As Chen Ping approached, he looked down at Prince Huo, who had lost all traces of arrogance, his face now filled with fear.
“Too smelly, you’d better rinse off,” Zhao Yu said, with a light wave of his hand, Prince Huo’s body flew up and landed in a nearby pond!
Chen Ping waved his hand from afar, making Prince Huo flail in the water like a puppet!
By the time Chen Ping pulled him out, the man was a drenched mess.
His pathetic, comical appearance was both laughable and absurd.
“Who dares to be so bold?”
Just as Prince Huo was about to despair, a squad of over a dozen soldiers rushed in!
“Save me, save me…” Prince Huo shouted desperately upon seeing them.
The soldiers, recognizing Prince Huo, paled and yelled at Chen Ping, “How dare you, release Prince Huo at once!”
Chen Ping glanced at the dozen soldiers, none of whom were in the Loose Immortal Realm, mere ants in his eyes.
“Open your eyes and see if they can save you,” Chen Ping sneered, then swung a fierce punch at the soldiers.
“Holy Light Fist…”
A massive fist imprint descended from the sky, enveloping all dozen soldiers!
