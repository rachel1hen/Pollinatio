The demons varied in form, some with massive wings, others covered in sharp spines.
Their eyes glowed with an eerie green light, and black flames spewed from their mouths, scorching the ground into blackened pits wherever they went.
The lead demon was enormous, standing ten zhang tall, with three massive horns sprouting from its head. It wielded a giant battle-axe, its blade radiating a chilling gleam that sent shivers down the spine.
Faced with these demons, Chen Ping was bewildered. These creatures were neither fully human, beast, nor demon, their forms bizarrely grotesque.
“These aren’t true demons. Though they carry demon blood, they’re abominations, crossbreeds of demons and beasts,” explained the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord, observing the scene.
“They may look hideous, but they’ve inherited the strength of beasts and the ferocity of demons. They’re tough to deal with.”
Chen Ping, hearing this, felt a mix of exasperation, especially at the word “crossbreed.”
His father was a golden dragon, a beast, and his mother was undeniably human.
Did that make him a crossbreed too?
“Big Brother, what in the world are these things? They’re terrifying…” Gadfly stared at the demons, his face full of shock.
“They’re abominations, crossbreeds of beasts and demons,” Chen Ping said.
“Crossbreeds?” Gadfly froze at the term.
The demon leader, hearing “crossbreed,” roared with fury.
“None of you will leave here alive today!”
The demon leader bellowed, swinging its battle-axe towards Chen Ping and Gadfly.
Chen Ping swiftly pulled Gadfly aside, dodging as the axe crashed into the ground, sending sparks flying.
“Gadfly, you handle the small fry, leave this big one to me!” Chen Ping shouted.
Gadfly nodded, a long spear materialising in his hand as he charged at the lesser demons.
The spear danced, its tip glinting coldly, each thrust claiming a demon’s life.
But the demons were overwhelming in number, endlessly pouring from the depths of the vein, soon surrounding Gadfly.
Chen Ping faced the demon leader head-on, the Dragon-Slaying Sword drawn once more, its blade blazing with light.
“Come on!” Chen Ping roared, charging at the demon leader.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword clashed with the battle-axe, producing a deafening boom, the immense force distorting the surrounding air.
The demon leader’s strength was formidable, each strike carrying the weight of mountains.
Chen Ping, relying on his agile movements, dodged the leader’s attacks while seeking openings to counter.
But the demon leader seemed to sense Chen Ping’s threat, its attacks growing fiercer, occasionally spewing black flames to trap him.
Chen Ping’s clothes were singed with holes, and his body bore several burns from the flames.
Yet he showed no sign of retreat, his gaze growing ever more resolute.
Taking a deep breath, he channelled his spiritual energy furiously, the Dragon-Slaying Sword’s glow intensifying.
“Die!” Chen Ping roared, unleashing his most powerful attack.
A colossal sword aura soared skyward, slashing towards the demon leader.
The demon leader, undaunted, swung its battle-axe, a black axe beam meeting the sword aura.
The collision triggered a massive explosion, the shockwave hurling nearby demons away.
Chen Ping was thrown back by the blast, crashing into a massive boulder, blood trickling from his mouth.
At that moment, Gadfly’s scream pierced the air.
Chen Ping turned to see Gadfly surrounded by demons, his body riddled with wounds, his situation dire.
Heart tightening, Chen Ping ignored his own injuries and rushed towards Gadfly.
Brandishing the Dragon-Slaying Sword, he cut down the demons attacking Gadfly, pulling him to his side.
“Big Brother, these demons are too strong, we’re no match for them!” Gadfly gasped, his face etched with exhaustion and fear.
