Captain Zhou was a person of the City Lord’s Mansion, and Qiu Tint even killed without the slightest hesitation, so it was evident that this Qiu Tint was even more ruthless than Qiu Yu!
“Did you injure my brother?”
Qiu Tu asked as he coldly looked at Chen Ping after killing Captain Zhou!
“You guess ……” Chen Ping smiled faintly!
Although this Qiu Tui was a fifth grade of the Mahayana realm, Chen Ping was not afraid, even if this Qiu Tui really had any skills, Chen Ping would have absolutely no problem protecting himself!
“Big brother, it’s him, he’s the one who beat me up, he even took away the beast dan of the people in our mansion, and my legs were also wasted by him.”
“You have to give me revenge, you have to give me revenge ah ……”
Qiu Yu cried out loudly for his brother to take revenge!
“Don’t worry, I won’t be letting him leave alive, your broken legs, I will also find a way to connect you.”
Qiu Tu looked at Chen Ping coldly, the killing intent in his eyes was very strong!
“Spliced?”
Chen Ping laughed, and with a wave of his hand, a white light flashed directly, and Qiu Yu’s legs that had been cut off, directly turned into powder!
All turned into powder, let’s see what else can be used to connect them!
“You ……”
Qiu Tu did not expect Chen Ping to be so rampant, a Ferrying Realm cultivator only, in the end where did the bottom, facing directly this Mahayana Realm fifth grade, can be unbridled!
“Go to hell ……”
Qiu Tu angrily shouted, the long sword behind him steeply sheathed, the stern sword qi cut through the sky, instantly causing the void to stir and sword intent to shoot out in all directions!
“Spirit Sword? I didn’t expect you to have a spirit sword as well!”
Chen Ping was a little surprised, because the sword on this Qiu Tu’s back was actually a spirit sword as well, and it obviously possessed a sword spirit!
It was very difficult to know that a spirit sword possessed a sword spirit, even if it possessed a sword spirit, it was also very complicated to enlighten the sword spirit!
Otherwise, the sword spirit will be followed by a machine in general, is not the slightest feelings can be said!
The sword spirit Zhong Li in Chen Ping’s Dragon Beheading Sword now belonged to a complete person, not a spirit body anymore, and also possessed a complete mind!
“I didn’t expect you to recognise a spirit sword, today, letting you die under this spirit sword of mine, you’re not at a disadvantage!”
The long sword in Qiu Tu’s hand continued to stir, a sword intent streaking across!
Chen Ping’s eyes moved slightly, the Dragon Cutting Sword in his hand was also swung in a smooth manner, a sword aura similarly chopped through the void, followed by the two sword auras colliding together!
Accompanied by a deafening sound, the two sword awns disappeared at the same time!
The entire void returned to calmness, Chen Ping only felt his palms slightly tingling!
On the other hand, that Qiu Tu’s eyes were wide open, looking at Chen Ping with a face full of incredulity!
He didn’t expect that Chen Ping would be hardened under his own strike, and that he hadn’t lost the wind!
He had to know that the sword in his hand was a spirit sword, possessing a sword spirit, and the sword spirit had opened his mind!
“Could it be that the kid’s hand is also a spirit sword?”
Qiu Tu stared at the Dragon Sword in Chen Ping’s hand as if he wanted to see something!
Qiu Tu’s eyes were as sharp as a falcon’s, locked onto the Dragon Cutting Sword in Chen Ping’s hand, the shock in his heart surging like a tidal wave.
He had never thought that this seemingly ordinary Ferrying Realm cultivator in front of him would also possess a Spirit Sword, and judging from that strike just now, the power of this Spirit Sword was by no means inferior to his own.
“You …… you this sword, is also a spirit sword?”Qiu Tu’s voice carried a trace of incredulous trembling, he could not understand why a cultivator whose realm was far below his own could possess such a precious treasure.
Chen Ping smiled blandly, the Dragon Beheading Sword in his hand trembled gently, as if responding to his master’s pride, “Not bad, this is the Dragon Beheading Sword, it has accompanied me for many years, and the spirit of the sword in the sword has also opened up its mind.”
Before the words fell, a flash of brilliant light suddenly bloomed on the Dragon Beheading Sword, the figure of the sword spirit Zhong Li loomed, and an ancient and majestic aura filled the air.
