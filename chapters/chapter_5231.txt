Black Bear Daoist let out a scream, crashing heavily to the ground, spitting blood, clearly gravely injured.
He looked at Nan Batian, eyes filled with terror, scrambling to escape.
Nan Batian sneered, his figure flashing again, a foot pinning Black Bear Daoist to the ground.
“Nan… Nan Batian, spare me!” Black Bear Daoist, now terrified, pleaded desperately, “I was blind, I didn’t know this young brother was your benefactor. Please let me go this once!”
Nan Batian scoffed disdainfully, “Spare you? When you were trying to kill Mr. Chen, did you think of sparing him?”
He pressed down slightly, and with a “crack,” Black Bear Daoist’s chest bone shattered.
With a kick, Nan Batian sent him flying, crashing into a boulder, dead.
Having dealt with Black Bear Daoist, Nan Batian turned to Chen Ping with a warm smile, “Mr. Chen, sorry for the scare.”
Chen Ping said gratefully, “Nan Batian, I owe you one. If you hadn’t shown up, Master Hu and I would’ve been…”
Nan Batian waved it off, “You’re my benefactor, and I promised to be your servant. No need for formalities. If you hadn’t saved me in the Heavenly Ladder, I’d still be trapped there. This is nothing.”
Chen Ping quickly introduced, “This is Master Hu Mazi, my friend.”
Hu Mazi bowed, “Hu Mazi, thank you for saving us.”
Nan Batian laughed, “No need to be polite, Master Hu. Any friend of Mr. Chen is a friend of mine.”
“Mr. Chen, why did you come to the Fifth Heaven? With your current strength, it’s tough to survive here.”
Chen Ping recounted his experiences in the Fourth Heaven and the destruction of the Hu clan, telling Nan Batian everything.
Nan Batian grew angrier, slamming his thigh when he heard of Black Demon Palace and Fairy Chilian’s deeds, “Outrageous! These scum dare act so arrogantly! Mr. Chen, don’t worry, with me here, I’ll help you get justice!”
Hu Mazi, hearing this, said gratefully, “Thank you, friend! I was planning to take revenge on Black Demon Palace and Fairy Chilian. With you, we’ve nothing to fear!”
With Nan Batian, a peak seventh-rank Earth Immortal, Black Demon Palace and Fairy Chilian were nothing!
“Mere Black Demon Palace and Chilian Sect, no big deal,” Nan Batian said dismissively, “Mr. Chen, when do you want to settle the score? I’ll go with you!”
A glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes, “No time like the present. Let’s go now!”
Nan Batian laughed, “Great! I like decisive people! Let’s head to the Fourth Heaven and deal with those scum from Black Demon Palace and Chilian Sect!”
With a wave of his hand, Nan Batian tore open the void, and the three entered the Fourth Heaven.
With his strength, Nan Batian could travel freely between the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Heavens without any passage.
Once in the Fourth Heaven, they didn’t linger, heading straight for Jiupan Mountain’s Black Demon Palace, especially Hu Mazi, who could barely contain himself.
With a powerful ally, he was ready to vent his frustrations.
He wanted to see who’d dare attack them now, who’d dare chase them around.
A peak seventh-rank Loose Immortal could wipe out all of Jiupan Mountain’s forces in minutes!
Imagining Youyue’s shock at seeing Nan Batian, Hu Mazi couldn’t help but grin.
He’d make Youyue pay, tormenting her until she begged for mercy to ease his hatred.
