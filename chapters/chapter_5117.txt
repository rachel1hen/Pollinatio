The Tianyuan Pavilion Master’s mouth emitted the voices of both a man and a woman simultaneously!
Clearly, these two warriors were summoned to suppress the two blood corpses!
Before the words faded, the two warriors swung their battle axes in unison.
The left warrior’s axe struck with fierce power, the axe wind rippling through space like water, a pitch-black axe beam slashing straight at the Pavilion Master’s head.
The right warrior’s axe moved with a sinister grace, the runes on its blade glowing, forming a massive black net that spanned the heavens, attempting to trap the Pavilion Master’s form.
The two contrasting forces intertwined, creating a miniature energy storm that forcibly dispersed the surrounding blood-red mist.
The Tianyuan Pavilion Master snorted coldly, no longer underestimating his foes.
He pressed his palms together, and a blood-red vortex suddenly appeared before his chest, from which a scaly, azure-armoured arm extended, the arm of the blood corpse!
The arm moved with blinding speed, leaving dozens of afterimages in the air, first striking the left warrior’s axe beam with a palm.
“Bang!”
With a deafening explosion, the axe beam shattered inch by inch, the left warrior forced back repeatedly, the black aura around it dimming by a third.
Then, the arm’s five fingers spread open, directly grasping the right warrior’s black net, the sound of its nails scraping the runes like metal grinding, the net collapsing instantly, the right warrior letting out a silent roar as its form trembled violently.
“Mere war spirits dare to act arrogantly before this seat?”
The Tianyuan Pavilion Master’s voice carried a hint of mockery as the blood corpse’s arm clenched into a fist, two beams of dark energy shooting from its centre, striking the warriors’ foreheads with precision.
“Pfft…”
The warriors’ bodies deflated like punctured balloons, black aura gushing out wildly.
They tried to reform, but the runes on their axe blades eroded under the blood corpse’s energy, disintegrating inch by inch.
The left warrior cast a final glance toward Sang Tianyang, the ghostly flames in its eyes extinguishing completely, dissipating into a wisp of black aura.
The right warrior let out an unwilling roar as its body crumbled, leaving only the two black axes to fall to the ground, their runes vanished, now mere ordinary black iron weapons.
“No… even they…”
Sang Tianyang watched the warriors’ annihilation, the last shred of hope in his heart crumbling.
He knew these warriors were ancient war spirits subdued by Chen Ping in the ruins, and now, with even their effortless slaughter, they were destroyed so easily, the Asura Hall had truly reached the end of its rope.
“Still resisting, Sang Tianyang?”
The Tianyuan Pavilion Master descended slowly, the blood corpse’s arm retracting into his body. He gazed down at Sang Tianyang, greed glinting in his eyes. “Hand over the Asura Blood Crystal, and I’ll grant you a swift, painless death.”
Sang Tianyang gave a bitter laugh, blood froth from his mouth forming a bewitching blood flower on his chest.
Suddenly, he raised his head, his eyes bursting with unprecedented brilliance. “Asura Hall… still has one final trump card!”
He bit through his tongue, spraying a mouthful of blood essence containing his primal life force, the essence transforming mid-air into a crimson seal, imprinting toward the depths of the collapsed ancestral shrine ruins within the Hall of Asura Hall.
“Ancestors of the Hall of Asura, your unworthy descendant, Sang Tianyang, begs the Old Ancestor… to descend upon this world!”
The moment his words fell, a roar shook the heavens from beneath the ruins, an ancient, majestic aura soaring skyward, tearing through the blood-red mist shrouding the Asura Hall.
The earth quaked violently, and a colossal figure, formed of countless white bones, slowly rose from the ruins.
The bones were draped in tattered golden dragon robes, two golden flames the size of millstones burning within the hollow eye sockets of its skull, the remnant soul of the Asura Hall’s Old Ancestor, passed down through millennia!
The Old Ancestor’s voice resounded like a chorus of countless ghosts, echoing across the heavens and earth: “Who… dares… to trespass upon my Asura Hall?”
For the first time, the Tianyuan Pavilion Master’s eyes showed a trace of gravity. He could sense the terrifying energy within the bone giant, an ancient power nearly surpassing the Transcendent Immortal Realm.
