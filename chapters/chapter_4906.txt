“I’m in the ninth heaven of the Heavenly Realm, at the Heavenly Demon rank. This ‘Red Cloud Demon Lord’ is just a nickname I use to get by, I never said I was at the Demon Lord realm!”
“You’re the one who assumed it, don’t call me a poser…”
Red Cloud Demon Lord said, a bit sheepish!
“No, no, Heavenly Demon’s already bloody impressive!”
Chen Ping hurried to say!
No wonder Red Cloud Demon Lord dodged the question about his realm earlier, even getting testy!
He was worried about his bluff being called!
But even at the Heavenly Demon rank, in a place like the Mortal Realm, that’d be like ruling the heavens and earth!
“So ‘Red Cloud Demon Lord’ is just a title. The mate I know is a ninth-heaven Heavenly Demon.”
“My name’s Chen Ping now, but if I changed it to Chen Saint, would that mean I’m invincible in the Heavenly Realm?”
Chen Ping grinned at the masked figure!
“What proof you got that you know Wind Demon, Yin Demon, or Blood Demon?”
The masked figure demanded!
“Proof?” Chen Ping sneered, then swung a fist at the platform behind the figure!
“Holy Light Fist…”
*Boom!*
With a deafening roar, the platform inside the palace crumbled to dust!
Then Chen Ping waved his hand, and waves of dao-patterned killing aura poured out of him!
Feeling the killing aura from Chen Ping, the masked figure was stunned!
“You… how do you have demonic aura? Are you human or demon?”
The masked figure was gobsmacked!
“What do you think?”
Chen Ping gave a cold smirk, and his dragon crystal began to glow. Behind him, a massive golden dragon slowly took shape!
But in an instant, Chen Ping reeled the dragon aura back in, as if nothing had happened!
“Beast clan?” The masked figure was utterly baffled now!
“How can one person carry the aura of three clans? Which clan do you even belong to?”
The masked figure interrogated Chen Ping!
“You tell me which, and that’s what I am. So if you’re only locking up humans here, you’ve got the wrong guy!”
Chen Ping chuckled!
Only now did the masked figure grasp how formidable Chen Ping was!
Forget his strength, the fact he carried the aura of three clans wasn’t something just anyone could pull off!
“You’re the only person I’ve ever seen with the aura of all three clans. That makes you a hot commodity around here.”
“You can roam freely across the entire first heaven of the Heavenly Realm…”
“You’ve got to understand, this place has clan domains. Humans have their zones, demons have theirs, and beasts have theirs!”
“They usually don’t leave their domains. If they accidentally wander into another clan’s turf, it’s dangerous.”
“Resources are limited, so each clan guards their domain’s resources fiercely!”
“But with you carrying all three auras, you can go anywhere, and no one’ll stop you!”
The masked figure explained to Chen Ping!
“So, you’re saying I can leave this place, no problem?”
Chen Ping asked!
“Of course, you could be one of us demons, so I’ve got no reason to hold you!” The masked figure nodded!
“Then tell me, why do you lock up human monks but let demons and beasts go?”
Chen Ping asked, curious!
“This is a demon domain. The Great Path’s guidance drops you here randomly, so of course I keep the human monks.”
“My demon kin, I let go. As for beasts, they’ve paid resources, so I let them pass too!”
The masked figure clarified!
“So, in other clan domains, there’d be demon monks guided by the Great Path who get locked up?”
Chen Ping pressed!
The masked figure nodded, “Exactly. Every few centuries, we swap the trapped folks around!”
“Then let me ask, before we got here, did you come across a man and a woman guided by the Great Path?”
Chen Ping wanted to know if Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi were trapped here too!
“No idea. The Great Path’s guidance sends folks to different spots each time!” the masked figure answered honestly!
