But before he could escape, the ground trembled, and a dark mass of people charged forward!
Niu Meng had returned with his men, Feng Xian, Hu Mazi, Bai Yi, Xiu Rui, Nuo Qing…
They all came back, bringing all the soldiers of Xiniu City!
“How could we abandon Big Brother? Everyone, charge, kill them all!”
Niu Meng roared.
The soldiers of Xiniu City surged towards the soldiers of Feihu City.
The two sides clashed once again in a chaotic battle!
Seeing this, Xie Zhong frowned slightly. They had clearly escaped, yet were forced back.
But this time, he knew he couldn’t flee again, or he’d never escape the Divine Hall’s punishment.
“Everyone, charge, fight to the last moment!”
Xie Zhong bellowed!
The soldiers of Feihu City knew they had no choice but to fight to the death!
The battle reached a fever pitch the moment it began!
Seeing this, Chen Ping gripped his sword and charged forward, no longer thinking of escape.
Chen Ping, the white-clad girl, Feng Xian, Hu Mazi, all were experts, cutting through the soldiers like they were in an empty realm. Even a first-grade Loose Immortal soldier couldn’t last a single round against them!
Gradually, Xiniu City gained the upper hand. Xie Zhong watched the scene, his eyes filled with helplessness and fear.
When all his men were wiped out, Feihu City would cease to exist, and he, as its lord, would be finished.
Just as Xie Zhong felt helpless, countless black shadows fell from the sky like rain.
These were black-clad figures, each with immense strength!
After escorting the Inspector, Huo Zhao had sent a large number of Eight Halls members.
The arrival of these Eight Halls members instantly tipped the scales in Feihu City’s favour.
On Xiniu City’s side, only Chen Ping and a few others were truly powerful, but these black-clad Eight Halls members were all at least second-grade Loose Immortals.
It had to be said, the Divine Hall’s strength was absurdly formidable!
Otherwise, a single Eight Halls could control the entire Feihu City, treating its lord, Xie Zhong, like a subordinate!
“Hahaha, brothers, reinforcements are here, the Divine Hall’s men have arrived, charge…”
Xie Zhong suddenly gained confidence!
The soldiers of Feihu City instantly surged with fighting spirit!
Chen Ping’s brows furrowed tightly. He hadn’t expected the Eight Halls to have so many men, and with such formidable strength.
But now that the chaotic battle had begun, escaping would be difficult!
He could only grit his teeth and fight desperately!
Just as Chen Ping was wielding the Dragon-Slaying Sword in a desperate struggle, a figure suddenly fell in front of him!
Chen Ping froze, then his body vanished in an instant. With a flash of sword light, a black-clad Eight Halls member’s head was severed.
While slaying the Eight Halls member, Chen Ping swiftly caught the falling figure.
“Friend Xiu…” Chen Ping looked at Xiu Rui.
Xiu Rui was covered in wounds, his breathing growing weaker!
“Seeing you’re alright puts my mind at ease.”
Xiu Rui spat blood as he spoke.
When he heard Chen Ping had stayed behind alone in danger, he didn’t hesitate to come along!
Bai Yi had even brought all the members of his Linghu Faction.
“You’re too foolish. In a battle like this, coming along is just asking to die, isn’t it?”
Chen Ping gently placed Xiu Rui on the ground, utterly perplexed!
Xiu Rui’s strength wasn’t great, only at the peak of Immortal Transformation, not even reaching Loose Immortal. Coming here to save him was tantamount to suicide.
“You saved my life, I couldn’t just stand by and watch you in danger.”
“Even if I die, it’s worth it. Without you, I might still be trapped in that cage for who knows how many years.”
Xiu Rui’s breathing grew weaker.
“Don’t worry, I won’t let you die.”
With that, Chen Ping took out an immortal stone he’d obtained from the treasure ground and placed it in Xiu Rui’s hand, “This is an immortal stone, it’ll definitely save you.”
“And these pills, all refined from various immortal herbs…”
Chen Ping spared no expense, giving Xiu Rui all sorts of resources to heal!
