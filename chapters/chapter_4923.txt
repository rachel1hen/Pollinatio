Bang!
At that moment, a muffled groan rang out, and one of the fighters collapsed on the platform, while the one called Long Qi stood tall!
“Young Master Long is awesome…”
“Young Master Long will definitely win…”
“Young Master Long is amazing…”
In an instant, the crowd below erupted, shouting wildly. Even the middle-aged man from before was yelling at the top of his lungs, praising Long Qi.
“Knowing it’s fake, why are you still cheering?”
Chen Ping saw the middle-aged man shouting and asked, puzzled.
Since they knew it was rigged, why bother praising and calling it awesome?
“What do you know? Just shout along, you’ll see soon enough.”
The middle-aged man urged Chen Ping and the others to join in.
On the platform, Long Qi, facing the crowd’s cheers, looked smug, his eyes brimming with arrogance.
“Reward…”
With Long Qi’s command, someone from the side of the crowd pulled out a storage pouch and began tossing out immortal coins.
The crowd went wild, frantically scrambling for the coins.
Chen Ping watched, utterly dumbfounded.
What the hell was this?
Risking everything to ascend to the heavenly realm, only to grovel and flatter others?
They had less backbone than ordinary folk.
Everyone bent down to pick up the coins. Caught off guard, even Xiu Rui crouched and joined the mad scramble.
The big man and the blue-eyed fellow also bent over. At that moment, everyone except Chen Ping was desperately grabbing coins from the ground.
Chen Ping stood out like a crane among chickens, showing no interest in the scattered coins.
Long Qi, up on the platform, noticed Chen Ping, who was looking up at him!
Their eyes met, and Long Qi felt a strange unease.
As the platform’s formation deactivated, the defeated fighter leapt down.
“Who’s next?” Long Qi shouted.
“Who’s next?” Long Qi shouted again.
Immediately, someone leapt onto the platform.
Without a word, it was fists and kicks again, and Long Qi won. The crowd resumed their flattery, some even calling Long Qi “grandpa.”
After all, the Long family was powerful and wealthy, a bit of flattery could earn some scraps.
Long Qi revelled in the adulation, having his men toss coins after each victory.
But every time, Chen Ping stood upright, never once bending down.
Long Qi grew increasingly curious about Chen Ping, though his gaze sharpened.
His rewards, ignored by Chen Ping, were a slap in the face, a sign of disrespect.
So, Long Qi had already decided that after the matches, he’d find out who this Chen Ping was and what background he had.
Like this, Long Qi defeated eight opponents in a row, nearing the ten-match challenge without stepping down.
But in the ninth match, Long Qi scanned the crowd below and said, “Who’s next?”
Someone was about to speak, but Chen Ping cut in first.
“I’ll give it a try…”
With that, Chen Ping leapt onto the platform.
Long Qi’s brows furrowed slightly, staring intently at Chen Ping.
The others were stunned, looking at Chen Ping on the platform, saying, “Who’s this kid? Doesn’t he know the rules?”
“Daring to disrupt Young Master Long’s match, is he tired of living?”
“This guy, is he trying to take advantage, seeing Young Master Long has fought eight matches?”
The crowd buzzed with talk about Chen Ping’s sudden appearance.
The middle-aged man turned to Xiu Rui, “Are you two together?”
“Yes!” Xiu Rui nodded.
“Then you’d better find a new companion. This kid’s done for, offending the Long family, he’s as good as dead.”
The middle-aged man advised Xiu Rui.
“Maybe not. Perhaps Friend Chen’s background is even bigger than that so-called Young Master Long.”
Xiu Rui smiled faintly.
