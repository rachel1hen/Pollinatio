Especially those two sword strikes just now, their speed was beyond imagination.
How could someone with a sixth-grade Loose Immortal cultivation possess such terrifying speed and attack power?
It simply defied reason! He even wondered if his eyes were playing tricks on him; this human cultivator before him was likely hiding his true strength.
The anger in the old man’s eyes gradually gave way to wariness, his tightly gripped bone staff slowly lowering, and the surging demonic aura around him subsided slightly.
He knew he was no match for this young man before him; fighting head-on would only lead to the same fate as those five others.
At that moment, Youyue’s voice rang out, laced with cold fury: “Elder Gui, what are you doing?”
She took a step forward, her purple eyes fixed on the old man, her aura radiating displeasure: “I’ve already said they are guests I invited to the Demon Palace. Why did you suddenly attack them? And you even deployed the Black Fiend Guards!”
The four cultivators in black armour were none other than the Black Fiend Guards, responsible for protecting the core areas of the Black Fiend Demon Palace. They answered directly to the Council of Elders, and even she, the Demoness, could not command them at will.
Elder Gui’s actions clearly showed he did not take her seriously.
Turning around, the wariness on Elder Gui’s face was instantly replaced by anger. He pointed at Youyue, his voice trembling with agitation: “Guests? Youyue, don’t forget your position! You are the Demoness of the Black Fiend Demon Palace, the future leader of the demon race. How can you treat two human cultivators as guests?”
“These two humans killed our Demon Palace disciples and tarnished our reputation. Not only did you not seek vengeance, but you’re bringing them into the main hall? Are you worthy of the ancestors of the Demon Palace?”
“Black Fiend Guards, where are you…”
With Elder Gui’s loud shout, dozens of Black Fiend Guards surged forward!
He abruptly turned to the newly summoned guards, barking sharply: “What are you all standing there for? Seize these two humans! I’ll take full responsibility for whatever happens!”
The Black Fiend Guards, emerging from both sides of the palace, immediately gripped their weapons, their gazes darting between Youyue and Elder Gui.
Numbering in the dozens, each exuded a formidable aura, including several second-grade Earth Immortal experts. They formed a dark, oppressive circle around Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, the tension in the air palpable.
“Stand down!”
Youyue’s cold command rang out, a flash of menace in her purple eyes. “I am the Demoness of the Black Fiend Demon Palace, and it’s not your place to give orders here!”
Yet, the Black Fiend Guards seemed deaf to her words, their eyes locked on Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, hands resting on their weapons, ready to strike at any moment.
Their gazes occasionally flicked to Elder Gui, clearly awaiting his next command.
Youyue’s expression turned exceptionally grim, her hand trembling slightly within her sleeve.
She knew Elder Gui held significant influence in the Demon Palace and that the Council of Elders had long been dissatisfied with her as the young Demoness. But she hadn’t expected them to openly defy her orders in public.
At that moment, Chen Ping suddenly chuckled, his gaze towards Youyue carrying a hint of amusement: “It seems, Demoness Youyue, your position in the Black Fiend Demon Palace isn’t all that secure.”
His words were like a needle, piercing straight into Youyue’s sore spot.
Her face shifted from pale to livid, then to a shade of purple, her gaze towards Chen Ping filled with complex emotions—anger, embarrassment, and a trace of barely concealed helplessness.
Seeing this, Elder Gui’s face lit up with a smug smile: “Did you hear that? Even an outsider can see you’re unfit to lead the Black Fiend Demon Palace!”
He turned to Chen Ping, his tone dripping with self-assured arrogance: “Boy, you’ve killed so many of my subordinates. Scared now? If you surrender quietly, I might let you die a quicker death…”
