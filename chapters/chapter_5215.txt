Hu Mazi, having expended a vast amount of spiritual energy, was pale and staggered back a few steps.
Chen Ping seized the opportunity, swinging his Dragon-Slaying Sword towards the chest of the Black Wind Demon.
Distracted by the old man’s plight, the Black Wind Demon failed to dodge in time, was struck by the sword, spat blood, and was sent flying backwards.
“Let’s go!”
Chen Ping shouted, grabbing Hu Mazi and rushing towards the secret chamber’s exit.
The Black Wind Demon and the old man wanted to pursue, but their severe injuries left them immobile, only able to watch as Chen Ping and Hu Mazi escaped.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi fled Black Wind Stronghold, heading west towards Jiupan Mountain.
They knew the stronghold’s people would soon give chase, so they had to leave quickly.
After escaping dozens of miles from Black Wind Stronghold, they stopped to rest in a hidden cave.
Hu Mazi’s face was ashen, his excessive use of talismans having drained his spiritual energy, making even lifting his hand difficult.
“You recover, I’ll keep watch.”
Chen Ping handed Hu Mazi a Qi-Replenishing Pill, then stood at the cave entrance, extending his divine sense to monitor the surroundings.
The strength of the Black Wind Demon and the mysterious old man far exceeded expectations, especially the latter, whose aura nearly reached the fifth rank of the Earthly Immortal Realm. Had Hu Mazi not used the ancestral talisman unexpectedly, their escape would have been unlikely.
“Chen Ping, that old man was bloody formidable. If not for my ancestral talisman and my strength gradually recovering, we’d probably be dead.”
Hu Mazi swallowed the pill, circulating spiritual energy to recover, his voice tinged with weakness.
“Likely the Black Wind Demon’s master, his cultivation is unfathomably deep.”
Chen Ping frowned, “For a mere stronghold on Jiupan Mountain’s outskirts to have such a powerhouse, this place is far more complex than we thought.”
He recalled the wolf demon’s words: the Black Wind Demon was involved in the attack on the Hu Clan, and the old man, as his master, was likely complicit.
More concerning was the old man’s mention of the Black Evil Demon Palace’s involvement, suggesting the Hu Clan’s extermination was a joint effort by multiple forces.
“Once I regain some strength, we’ll investigate the next faction.”
Hu Mazi’s eyes flashed with determination, “No matter how many are involved, I’ll uncover the truth.”
Chen Ping nodded, about to speak, when his expression sharpened, “Someone’s coming!”
No sooner had he spoken than a whooshing sound came from outside, and three shadowy figures landed like spectres at the cave entrance, blocking their path.
The leader wore a black robe, face hidden by a hood, revealing only a pair of glowing red eyes, unmistakably from the Black Evil Demon Palace.
“Mr. Chen, Master Hu, long time no see.”
The black-robed figure let out a hoarse laugh, his voice grating like sandpaper, “Her Highness the Demoness invites you to return with us.”
“Youyue’s finally lost patience.” Chen Ping gripped his Dragon-Slaying Sword, spiritual energy quietly circulating, “How many did she send?”
“For you two, three of us are enough.”
The two figures behind the leader stepped forward, their auras comparable to Youyue’s, clearly top experts of the Demon Palace.
Hu Mazi forced himself to stand, clutching the clan leader’s token, its white light resonating with his spiritual energy, slightly boosting his spirit, “Want us to go back? First ask if my talisman agrees!”
“Foolish.”
The black-robed figure on the left sneered, his form flickering as he lunged forward, fingers claw-like, enveloped in dense demonic energy, aiming for Hu Mazi’s throat.
The claw was lightning-fast, its foul demonic energy thickening the cave’s air before it even struck.
Hu Mazi didn’t dare hesitate, channelling his remaining spiritual energy into the clan leader’s token, which erupted in dazzling white light, forming a protective light curtain before him.
