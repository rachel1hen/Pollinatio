Chen Ping immediately clasped his fists, showing a respectful demeanour. “Young Master Tianci’s reputation is renowned. How could I not know you? I’m just new here and didn’t react in time.”
A wise man doesn’t court trouble, and Tianci’s displayed strength clearly defied norms, capable of fighting beyond his level. Chen Ping knew he had to tread carefully.
Until he understood Tianci’s true power, Chen Ping felt it best to keep a low profile.
Tianci nodded, satisfied, then turned to Mo Qingyun with a chilling smile. “Sister Qingyun, you didn’t even tell me you returned from the First Heaven. How did you end up here?”
Mo Qingyun, still shaken by Tianci’s earlier act of killing on a whim, was unnerved by his recklessness.
Biting her lip, she said softly, “I… I came here from the First Heaven.”
“The First Heaven?” Tianci sneered. “Sister Qingyun, you must be joking. How could there be an entrance to these ruins in the First Heaven?”
“We…” Mo Qingyun tried to insist she came from the First Heaven, but Chen Ping stopped her.
“Young Master Tianci, we were just curious and came to explore, hoping to find some treasures,” Chen Ping said, unwilling to reveal that there was an entrance in the First Heaven.
If that got out, Cangxuan Continent would be in danger, swarmed by Second Heaven cultivators.
“Who are you? Why are you with Sister Qingyun?” Tianci’s expression turned cold as he interrogated Chen Ping.
“I…” Chen Ping struggled to explain his relationship with Mo Qingyun.
“Brother Tianci, who’s that woman by your side?” Mo Qingyun quickly changed the subject, worried Tianci might harm Chen Ping.
“Oh, just a maidservant attending to me. If Sister Qingyun doesn’t like her, I’ll make her leave.” Tianci smiled faintly and casually struck the woman beside him.
The blow killed her instantly, her head exploding.
Mo Qingyun trembled, her face paling in horror.
Chen Ping was stunned, his gaze growing wary and cautious.
Facing a master wasn’t frightening, but dealing with a madman like this was a real headache.
The man in green was practically trembling with fear.
“Who are you to Sister Qingyun?” Tianci pressed, undeterred even after killing the woman.
“Brother Tianci, he’s just a servant of mine. I saw he was of humble origin and low cultivation, so I took him on to carry my things,” Mo Qingyun hurriedly explained.
Tianci eyed Chen Ping, smirking. “A first-grade Loose Immortal making it to the Second Heaven? You must have some skill.”
“What’s your background?”
Chen Ping quickly shook his head. “I’m from a poor background, living in the First Heaven. I don’t know why, but a black hole suddenly sucked me in, and I ended up in the Second Heaven.”
“Compared to Young Master Tianci, I’m only fit to be a servant…”
Tianci, pleased by the flattery, smiled faintly. “The space between the First and Second Heavens does often warp, creating black holes. You’re quite unlucky. If you hadn’t met my kind-hearted Sister Qingyun, you’d be dead by now.”
“A mere first-grade Loose Immortal dreaming of surviving in the Second Heaven? That’s just delusional…”
The man in green remained silent. Though he didn’t know Chen Ping’s true identity, he knew Chen Ping wasn’t as powerless as he claimed.
He had seen the power of Chen Ping’s sword strike firsthand.
If Chen Ping, a mere first-grade Loose Immortal, reached the third grade, his strength might even surpass Tianci’s.
