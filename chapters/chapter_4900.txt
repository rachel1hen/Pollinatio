With Chen Ping’s body now restored to peak condition, he could allow the Red Cloud Demon Lord to unleash even greater strength!
“I’m not bragging, but this’ll be done in a jiffy…”
The Red Cloud Demon Lord declared!
“Alright then, Senior, take control of my body!”
Chen Ping handed over control to the Red Cloud Demon Lord. He had no intention of being trapped here forever!
A golden light erupted around Chen Ping’s body!
As the Red Cloud Demon Lord took over, the unleashed power left Xiu Rui utterly stunned!
“This… is this really the kind of power a first-tier Immortal Transformation monk can unleash?”
Xiu Rui stared at Chen Ping in disbelief.
“Break!”
Chen Ping threw a punch at the cage!
A terrifying force surged forth!
The cage holding Chen Ping shuddered violently, and the black chains binding it shattered instantly!
The cage itself collapsed, crumbling into dust and vanishing completely!
Chen Ping hovered in the void, surrounded by countless other cages!
“Mate, you’re incredible! Can you get me out too?”
Xiu Rui asked, his face full of shock!
He’d been trapped for over five hundred years. If someone could break his cage and set him free, he’d be ready to pledge his life in gratitude!
Being stuck in a cage with no resources to cultivate, no one to talk to—it was mind-numbingly dull!
“No problem…”
Chen Ping nodded. It was a small matter, hardly any trouble at all!
*Boom!*
Chen Ping launched a punch at the cage holding Xiu Rui, and the moment it met his terrifying force, the cage disintegrated into powder!
As the cage vanished, Xiu Rui’s body began to plummet. After so long without flying, he’d probably forgotten how!
Chen Ping reached out, grabbing Xiu Rui, and channelled a stream of spiritual energy into him. It revived Xiu Rui somewhat, bringing colour back to his face!
Xiu Rui clung tightly to Chen Ping’s hand, his face brimming with excitement and joy!
After all these years, he was finally free from his torment…
And it was all thanks to Chen Ping. Without him, another five hundred years might not have been enough to escape!
“Friend Chen, thank you, truly, thank you!”
Xiu Rui’s eyes welled up, tears streaming down his face!
“Just a small favour…” Chen Ping said with a faint smile!
At that moment, Xiu Rui’s face flushed, and he apologised, “I’m really sorry, I underestimated you earlier. Who’d have thought a first-tier Immortal Transformation monk could unleash power stronger than me, someone at the peak of the realm!”
Chen Ping merely smiled, keeping quiet about the Red Cloud Demon Lord’s possession.
“Friend Xiu, you’re at the peak of Immortal Transformation. One step, one insight, and you could ascend to the Heavenly Realm. Why bother with the Ladder to Heaven’s guidance?”
Chen Ping was genuinely curious about Xiu Rui’s reasoning!
“Well, I’ve been stuck at the peak of Immortal Transformation for centuries, never able to ascend. Out of options, I took the Ladder to Heaven to reach the Celestial Realm.”
“Who could’ve guessed the Ladder’s guidance would be such a trap? Eyes open, and bam, straight into a cage!”
“If I’d known, I’d never have bothered with that blasted Ladder!”
Xiu Rui sighed, clearly regretting it deeply!
Wasting centuries in that cage for nothing!
“Friend Xiu, have you seen anyone who came with me?”
Chen Ping wanted to know where Hu Mazi had ended up!
“No, it seems like it was just you. I didn’t see any companions!”
“Is your companion a human monk too? If they’re from another race, they might not be locked up here!”
Xiu Rui asked!
Chen Ping nodded, “He is!”
Though Hu Mazi had immortal bones, he was indeed a human monk!
“That’s tricky then. There are thousands upon thousands of cages here. I’ve no idea which one your companion might be in, unless the master of these cages knows!”
Xiu Rui shook his head, looking helpless!
