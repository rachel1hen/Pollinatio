The door to the secret chamber was made of black stone, carved with intricate runes that emitted a faint glow, clearly protected by a ward.
“How do we get past this warded door?” Hu Mazi asked.
“Let me try,” Chen Ping replied, pulling a ward-breaking talisman from his robes and placing it on the door.
The talisman’s runes flickered briefly, and the glow of the door’s runes gradually faded as the ward was dispelled.
The two quietly pushed open the door and stepped into the chamber.
Inside, Black Wind Demon and an old man were conversing.
“Master, do you think Black Evil Demon Palace knows we were involved in the attack on the Hu clan back then?” Black Wind Demon asked.
“Unlikely,” the old man said. “We covered our tracks well, and Black Evil Demon Palace was involved too. They won’t expose themselves.”
“Good,” Black Wind Demon sighed in relief. “I was worried they’d use it as an excuse to attack Black Wind Stronghold.”
“Don’t worry, Black Evil Demon Palace has its own troubles now. They won’t move against us lightly,” the old man said. “Still, we should prepare, just in case.”
“Yes, Master,” Black Wind Demon replied.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, hiding by the door, overheard the conversation, their eyes flashing with anger.
To think Black Evil Demon Palace and Black Wind Stronghold were both involved in the Hu clan’s extermination, colluding together, truly deserving of death!
Suddenly, the old man opened his eyes, glaring at the door and shouting, “Who’s there?”
Realising they’d been spotted, Chen Ping and Hu Mazi dropped their concealment and charged out.
“It’s you two!” Black Wind Demon glared at Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, his face a mix of shock and rage. “You dare eavesdrop on us?”
“Black Wind Demon, you despicable scum!” Hu Mazi roared. “I never imagined you were part of the attack on my Hu clan. Today, I’ll avenge my people!”
“Avenge them? With just the two of you?” Black Wind Demon sneered. “Since you heard what you shouldn’t, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”
Black Wind Demon and the old man attacked simultaneously, lunging at Chen Ping and Hu Mazi.
Prepared, Chen Ping and Hu Mazi fought back.
Chen Ping summoned his Dragon-Slaying Sword, clashing with Black Wind Demon, while Hu Mazi pulled out talisman papers to confront the old man.
The battle in the chamber was fierce, spiritual energy collisions shattering tables and chairs into dust.
Black Wind Demon’s strength was formidable, equivalent to a peak third-grade Earth Immortal. Though Chen Ping was strong, he couldn’t gain the upper hand quickly.
The old man’s power was even more unfathomable. Hu Mazi was no match, quickly falling into a precarious position.
“Master Hu, watch out!” Chen Ping saw Hu Mazi in danger and grew anxious, but Black Wind Demon kept him pinned, unable to assist.
In this critical moment, Hu Mazi recalled an ancestral talisman technique. He swiftly drew a powerful talisman on several sheets of paper.
“Ancestral power, aid me in vanquishing the enemy!” Hu Mazi shouted, hurling the talisman at the old man.
The talisman exploded with dazzling light, forming a massive golden palm that struck towards the old man.
Caught off guard by the talisman’s power, the old man hurriedly channelled his spiritual energy, forming a black shield in front of him.
With a deafening “bang,” the golden palm collided with the black shield, unleashing a thunderous roar.
The black shield shattered instantly, and the old man, struck by the golden palm, was sent flying, coughing up blood.
