Chen Ping looked at him without the slightest trace of pity.
Back when Qin Feng had used an aphrodisiac to trap Ling Xue, had he ever thought of mercy?
“You have committed too many evils, you cannot be spared.”
Chen Ping swung his sword down, completely ending Qin Feng’s life.
With the deaths of Qin Lie and his son, the once glorious Divine Sword Manor was destroyed.
When the dust settled, the Sword Sect’s stronghold was left in ruins, yet the air carried the relief of survival after disaster.
Daoist Wuji stepped forward and handed Chen Ping a jade bottle. “This is our Thunder Sound Temple’s sacred healing medicine, the Nine Revolutions Soul Returning Pill. It has remarkable effects on damage to the meridians in your body.”
“Many thanks, Daoist.” Chen Ping accepted it with solemn respect and bowed deeply.
If they had not arrived in time today, the consequences would have been unimaginable.
Daoist Wuwei smiled. “Between us, there is no need for thanks. Only now that your dragon bloodline and the Fire Qilin have been revealed, I fear your days will not be peaceful.”
“I understand.” Chen Ping nodded. He had already been prepared.
“We still have other matters to attend to, so we will take our leave first.”
Daoist Wuji glanced at Ling Xue, a trace of amusement in his eyes. “Miss Ling, Chen Ping is a man worthy of trust, but you may need to get used to having more sisters in the future.”
Ling Xue blushed and lowered her head without speaking.
Daoist Wuji and Daoist Wuwei exchanged a smile, then left with the disciples of Thunder Sound Temple in two streaks of golden light.
Nan Batian walked forward and patted Chen Ping on the shoulder. “Brother, take care and recover. If anything happens, you can always come to me.” With that, he too departed with the people of the Information Tower.
Chen Ping watched the figures leaving, a warmth rising in his heart.
He turned to Mo Chen. “Master, please first lead the disciples to tend their wounds and reinforce the stronghold.”
“Very well.” Mo Chen nodded, his eyes full of relief.
Li Chunfeng came to Chen Ping’s side, his tone heavy. “Although the Divine Sword Manor is gone, the Divine Palace and the Evil Path Hall will not let this rest. You must be very careful.”
“I know.” Chen Ping paused. “City Lord Li, as for the affairs of Sword Saint City…”
“Leave it to me.”
A fierce light flashed in Li Chunfeng’s eyes. “Manager Zhang and those traitors who colluded with foreign powers must also be purged.”
With that, Li Chunfeng turned and left. His snow-white robe carried a chilling aura of killing intent.
In the following days Sword Saint City was full of upheaval.
Li Chunfeng launched a sweeping purge with thunderous methods. Manager Zhang and his faction were captured in one net, and those high-ranking figures who had once colluded with Qin Lie were all stripped of power.
The city went through a storm of change, but finally returned to Li Chunfeng’s control, its order restored.
Meanwhile, Chen Ping quietly recuperated at the Sword Sect stronghold.
The Nine Revolutions Soul Returning Pill truly lived up to its name. His broken meridians healed at a speed visible to the naked eye, and the power of the Divine Dragon and the three races gradually stabilised.
Ling Xue brought him medicine every day. After experiencing life and death together, their bond had become even closer. Only when the subject of that night was brought up did Ling Xue still blush crimson.
One day Chen Ping was finally able to get out of bed. He walked into the courtyard and watched the Sword Sect disciples cultivating, a look of determination flashing in his eyes.
The fall of the Divine Sword Manor was only the beginning. Greater challenges still awaited him.
The Divine Palace, the Evil Path Hall, and enemies hiding in the shadows, he had to improve his strength quickly to protect those around him.
“Senior Brother Chen Ping.”
Ling Xue walked over with a bowl of medicine, her face carrying a gentle smile.
Chen Ping accepted it and drank it all in one go. Then he held her hand. “Ling Xue, when my wounds heal, we will go to the Black Wind Mountains together and destroy the Evil Path Hall’s branch once and for all.”
Ling Xue nodded firmly. “Yes, I will go with you.”
“To go against the Evil Path Hall, my strength is not yet enough. I must increase my cultivation quickly.”
“I will take you into the Demon Suppression Tower for dual cultivation. Together we will grow stronger.”
Chen Ping took Ling Xue into the Demon Suppression Tower.
Ling Xue’s face turned crimson. She knew that in the days to come she might not even have the strength to stand.
