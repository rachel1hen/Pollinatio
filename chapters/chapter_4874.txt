Chen Ping emerged from the third level with Li Chunfeng and Shen Zhiyan in tow!
He noticed that not many cultivators had followed them out. Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi weren’t among them, likely having already passed the third level and reached the fourth!
Without pausing, Chen Ping glanced at the fourth level of the Ladder to Heaven and resolutely stepped up!
Li Chunfeng and Shen Zhiyan followed closely behind, after all, they were now Chen Ping’s servants!
Though the fourth-level guardian was said to be difficult, Chen Ping had to give it a shot!
He couldn’t just get stuck on the fourth level and never progress, right?
Just as Chen Ping entered the fourth level, a voice rang out, “Chen Ping, you’ve made it to the fourth level too?”
Chen Ping froze, “Yun Li, didn’t you leave already?”
“I did, but I can come back anytime! As long as the Ladder to Heaven still stands, I can enter the fourth level whenever I want!”
“But this time I came in, I noticed the fourth-level world has changed again!”
“Look at that palace up ahead, that’s where the guardian is. It’s surrounded by nothingness, as if this fourth-level world only has this one palace left!”
“Before I left, this was still a complete world, I don’t know why it’s like the world just vanished!”
Yun Li pointed at the palace not far off!
Chen Ping took a look, his face full of confusion, though he had no idea why it had turned out this way!
Each level was supposed to be its own world, where entering cultivators had to search for the guardian to challenge!
They could even gather resources within the Ladder to Heaven’s worlds!
But now, they were teleported straight to the guardian’s location upon entry, and the surrounding world seemed to have disappeared!
Forget resources, it looked like entering here meant only challenging the guardian, cultivating with the level’s resources was no longer an option!
“Who cares what’s going on, let’s go check it out and we’ll know!”
With that, Chen Ping strode straight toward the palace!
“Be careful, not many can pass this fourth-level guardian!”
Yun Li warned Chen Ping!
Chen Ping nodded.
As the group approached the palace, they saw it was pitch black all over, exuding an eerie aura like the underworld!
When Chen Ping and the others reached the entrance, gusts of chilling wind blew around them, bitterly cold. Above the palace, a dark cloud loomed, with lightning flashing through it constantly!
And from within the palace, sounds of combat echoed, suggesting someone was already challenging the guardian!
Then, with a scream, a tall cultivator flew out of the palace.
Midair, his body disintegrated into dust, his soul and form utterly destroyed!
Seeing this, Chen Ping’s expression darkened. He hadn’t expected the fourth-level guardian to kill so ruthlessly. It was just a challenge, if you couldn’t win, getting injured was fine, but to be annihilated like that?
Yun Li’s face paled too, swallowing hard, “Chen Ping, I think we should leave, this fourth-level guardian’s a bit unhinged!”
Li Chunfeng and Shen Zhiyan’s expressions shifted as well!
Imprisoned here, they had no grudges with the Celestial Realm’s cultivators. Normally, they’d just injure them and call it a day, sometimes even letting them pass after a light spar!
In all their time, they’d never killed a Celestial Realm cultivator so brutally!
But this fourth-level guardian, wiping someone out completely, was downright cruel!
“Since we’re here, let’s go in and take a look. We don’t have to challenge him.”
“Surely he wouldn’t attack and kill us just for not challenging him, right?”
With that, Chen Ping stepped inside!
