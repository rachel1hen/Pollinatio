“This can’t be an illusion, can it? I clearly didn’t see a mountain just now, this mountain must be fake.”
After Gadfly finished speaking, he suddenly swung a palm towards the mountain in front of him.
If this mountain was fake, an illusion, then this palm would surely miss.
Rumble…
With a deafening roar, followed by flying sand and scattered stones, rocks flew everywhere.
This palm had actually struck the mountain.
“Real?”
Gadfly’s face was full of shock!
“This mountain is real, not an illusion. If it were an illusion, it wouldn’t escape my eyes.”
Chen Ping was someone who possessed the origin of illusion; if it was an illusion, it couldn’t possibly deceive him.
At that moment, a terrifying aura suddenly burst from the mountain wall!
Boom!
Before Gadfly could react, he was directly blasted backwards.
“Damn, this mountain can fight back? Is it alive?”
Gadfly was stunned.
He had struck the mountain with a palm, but the mountain had hit him back.
Could this mountain hold a grudge?
“There’s a formation on this mountain. That palm of yours just triggered the formation’s backlash!”
Chen Ping said, staring at the mountain in front of him.
Chen Ping noticed golden light flickering on the mountain wall, and the aura it emitted was extremely powerful.
“A formation?” Gadfly seemed a bit speechless, “What now? I never knew there was a mountain in this treasure land, let alone one with a formation.”
“A mere formation can’t stop me!”
Chen Ping, acting quite arrogantly, walked to the foot of the mountain. Looking at the towering peak, he opened his palm, and the Dragon-Slaying Sword appeared instantly.
Boom!
Chen Ping swung a single sword strike at the mountain wall, and the golden light shattered, the formation instantly broken.
After the formation was dispelled, a winding stone staircase appeared at the foot of the mountain, leading straight into the belly of the mountain, giving off an eerie vibe.
“Big brother, you’re awesome…”
Seeing this, Gadfly couldn’t help but give Chen Ping a thumbs-up.
Gadfly’s cultivation level was much higher than Chen Ping’s, but he was genuinely impressed.
Chen Ping’s repeated displays had left Gadfly in complete awe.
“Let’s go, we’ll head inside. You follow behind me, don’t get yourself killed if we run into danger…”
Chen Ping said to Gadfly.
“Got it!” Gadfly nodded obediently and followed behind Chen Ping.
The two of them climbed the stone steps, heading into the mountain’s core. Chen Ping led the way, while Gadfly followed nervously.
Even with Chen Ping in front, Gadfly was still extremely tense. The terrifying aura from the formation’s outburst earlier still left him shaken.
As they continued forward, the eerie atmosphere grew stronger, and the sinister energy began to invade their bodies.
Gadfly felt his body turn ice-cold, extremely uncomfortable, and could only use his inner strength to resist the sinister energy’s intrusion.
Chen Ping, however, seemed completely at ease. Not only did he not block the sinister energy, but he also activated the Heart-Calming Technique, absorbing the surrounding sinister energy.
To Gadfly, this sinister energy was like poison, but to Chen Ping, it was a cultivation resource.
After walking for some time, they suddenly noticed the stone steps had vanished, and a stone wall blocked their path!
Chen Ping and Gadfly stared at the stone wall in front of them. The wall was covered with densely packed runes, glowing with an eerie light.
The arrangement of the runes was completely beyond their understanding, neither resembling common formation patterns nor relating to any known writing system.
“What the hell is this?”
Gadfly frowned, unable to hold back his complaints.
He reached out to touch the stone wall, but the moment his fingertips nearly made contact, a sharp, stinging pain shot through him.
It felt like countless tiny needles pricking him. He quickly pulled his hand back, shaking it, “Damn, you can’t even touch it!”
