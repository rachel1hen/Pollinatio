Ling Xue looked at the figure inside the barrier, her eyes sparkling continuously. “He not only wasn’t devoured by the baleful qi, but instead used the momentum to break through… This kind of comprehension and disposition is truly terrifying.”
Mo Chen let out a long breath, a gratified smile appearing on his face. “Sword Sect has picked up a treasure.”
At this moment, Chen Ping slowly sheathed his sword and stood.
His aura was several times stronger than before. Although faint black qi still lingered around his body, his eyes were clear and bright, without the slightest sign of qi deviation.
He lowered his head to look at his hands, feeling the perfect fusion of spiritual power and baleful qi within his body. Every gesture carried a sharp edge.
The stone tablet of the sword tomb lit up again, the ancient characters on it flowing faster, as if praising his comprehension.
And as the baleful qi calmed, the sword domain barrier isolating inside and outside gradually became thinner.
“Master, we should go to the Black Wind Mountain Range now,” Chen Ping said to Mo Chen.
Mo Chen nodded. “Alright. Your strength has already risen to the ninth grade of the Loose Immortal Realm. Plus the ‘Sword Saint Inheritance’, dealing with the eighth grade of the Earth Immortal Realm should not be a problem.”
Hu Mazi also excitedly said, “Chen Ping, with this breakthrough of yours, we can finally go settle accounts with the Evil Path Hall! This time, we must rescue the divine souls of my Hu clan!”
Hu Mazi knew that the stronger Chen Ping’s strength, the greater the chance of rescuing the divine souls of their Hu clan!
“Chen Ping, although your strength is not weak now, I feel you should seclude yourself and cultivate for a period. Even if you are now at the ninth grade of the Loose Immortal Realm, wanting to deal with the Evil Path Hall is still like an egg striking a rock!” Mo Chen advised!
“Master, I…”
“Don’t call me Master anymore. Your current strength probably surpasses mine already…” Mo Chen hurriedly waved his hand!
It wasn’t that Mo Chen didn’t want to accept Chen Ping, but Chen Ping was too monstrous. He wasn’t worthy to be Chen Ping’s master!
In such a short time, Chen Ping’s strength had risen like a rocket.
“Master, much of my sword intent was taught by you. Calling you Master is only right.”
“This time going to the Black Wind Mountain Range, I’m just going to scout the situation, so there won’t be any danger.”
Chen Ping said!
Mo Chen pondered for a moment, then gritted his teeth. “I’ll accompany you there.”
“Ling Xue, you take the junior brothers back to Sword Saint City. Don’t run around during this time. That Divine Sword Manor won’t let it go.”
Mo Chen had Ling Xue take the people back, while he followed Chen Ping and the others towards the Black Wind Mountain Range!
Black Wind Mountain Range, Evil Path Hall branch hall.
In a sinister great hall, a black-robed elder was sitting cross-legged. On the altar in front of him were placed dozens of black soul urns, in which countless wronged souls could vaguely be seen struggling.
“Hehe, Chen Ping, are you finally coming?” The black-robed elder opened his eyes, a strange red light flashing in them. “I’ve been waiting for you for a long time…”
The Black Wind Mountain Range was perennially shrouded in black baleful qi, with demonic beasts rampant in the mountains, and countless weird formation traps. Ordinary cultivators fundamentally dared not venture deep.
Chen Ping, Mo Chen, and Hu Mazi, the three of them cautiously traversed the mountain range. Hu Mazi from time to time took out pathfinding talismans and clear baleful talismans to dispel the surrounding baleful qi.
“This Black Wind Mountain Range’s baleful qi is heavier than I imagined.”
Hu Mazi frowned as he said, “My clear baleful talismans can only barely protect a three-zhang range around us. If we go further in, I’m afraid they won’t work.”
Mo Chen said, “The Evil Path Hall’s branch hall is definitely in the core area of the mountain range, where the baleful qi is the densest and most dangerous. We must act carefully.”
Chen Ping nodded, circulating the Heart Condensing Art, desperately absorbing the baleful qi, reducing the concentration of baleful qi around them.
In cooperation with Hu Mazi’s clear baleful talismans, forming a double protection.
Chen Ping had no way to absorb and refine all the baleful qi here. That required time, but Chen Ping had no time.
They had to rescue Hu Mazi’s clansmen’s divine souls as soon as possible, and moreover, it was not certain that Hu Mazi’s clansmen’s divine souls still existed.
