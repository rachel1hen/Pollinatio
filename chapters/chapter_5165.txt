Chen Ping slowly paced through the hall, each step sparking new insights in his mind. The Nine Shadows Sword Technique was continuously refined in his understanding, already bearing a trace of the stone man’s sword charm.
The cool moonlight spilled over the forest, and the sky had darkened.
“Damn it, why hasn’t that Chen Ping come out yet? Could he be in some danger?”
Hu Mazi rubbed his goatee, pacing back and forth, the talisman pouch at his waist jingling with his movements.
“Master Hu, please stay calm. Chen Ping is blessed with good fortune, he’ll be fine,”
Mo Qingyun, dressed in a green robe, had a trace of worry between his brows but remained composed.
Huo Jingjing tightly gripped her sword, its blade reflecting the moonlight, illuminating her tense profile, “We’ll wait another half hour. If there’s still no sign of him, I’m going in to find him!”
Before her words had fully landed, two figures slowly emerged. Chen Ping and Yun Wuya walked out side by side, the Dragon-Slaying Sword in Chen Ping’s hand gleaming brightly.
“Chen Ping!”
Huo Jingjing’s eyes lit up. She rushed forward with her sword, looking him up and down, “Are you alright? The sword intent on you… why does it feel different?”
Hu Mazi squinted, calculating with his fingers, then exclaimed in shock, “Good heavens! You brat, have you made a breakthrough inside? This sword intent, it’s far stronger than before!”
Mo Qingyun also stepped forward, carefully observing Chen Ping, then nodded, “Indeed, Chen Ping’s sword intent has reached a transformative state, faintly resonating with the heavens and earth. It seems he didn’t encounter danger, but rather gained an opportunity.”
Chen Ping smiled and briefly explained that the stone man was a sword spirit, guiding him to comprehend a higher level of sword intent.
Everyone was amazed at the story.
“So, this ancient sword in your hand is what the sword spirit transformed into?”
Hu Mazi pointed at the ancient sword in Chen Ping’s hand. The sword was pitch black, with a faint totem carved on its hilt, emanating a subtle chill.
“Exactly.”
Chen Ping picked up the ancient sword, its coolness sinking into his hand, resonating faintly with the Dragon-Slaying Sword, “Though this sword has no name, its sword intent is vast, complementing the Dragon-Slaying Sword perfectly.”
“Jingjing, this sword is for you…” Chen Ping handed the ancient sword to Huo Jingjing.
Huo Jingjing looked at the dark ancient sword Chen Ping offered. Before her fingers even touched the blade, she could already sense its sword intent, akin to the Dragon-Slaying Sword’s yet deeper and more profound.
She instinctively stepped back half a pace, her delicate brows furrowing, “Chen Ping, this sword is the embodiment of the sword spirit, greatly beneficial to your cultivation. I…”
“My woman uses my sword, that’s only natural.”
Chen Ping’s tone left no room for argument as he pressed the ancient sword into Huo Jingjing’s hand.
The sword felt slightly heavy in her grip, a cool stream flowing through her meridians, faintly resonating with the sword essence in her body.
Huo Jingjing froze, looking down at the ancient sword. The faint totem seemed to shimmer with light, subtly aligning with the sword techniques she cultivated.
“But this sword…”
“No buts.”
Chen Ping took her hand, making her grip the hilt tightly, his gaze intense under the moonlight, carrying an unmistakable seriousness.
Huo Jingjing’s cheeks warmed. Catching Yun Wuya’s half-smiling glance, Hu Mazi chuckling while stroking his beard, and Mo Qingyun’s calm nod, her fleeting thought of refusal vanished.
She took a deep breath, tightly grasping the ancient sword, feeling its vast sword intent, and nodded firmly, “Alright, I’ll accept it. If one day I’m unworthy of it, I’ll return it to you.”
“Silly words.” Chen Ping ruffled her hair.
“Chen Ping, you can’t play favourites. You should give something to Miss Mo too, she’s your woman as well.”
“You can’t just have your fun and then ignore her!” Hu Mazi said with a laugh.
“Of course, the next good thing goes to Qingyun.” Chen Ping smiled faintly, “Let’s head to the Seventh Hall, see if there’s anything good there.”
The group set off toward the Seventh Hall.
