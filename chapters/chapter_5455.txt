Chen Ping knew that he was no match for the Soul Devouring Venerable at all.
The only thing he could do now was to run away.
“Imperial Fire Step!”
Chen Ping shouted softly, and the spiritual power in his body erupted instantly, with a ball of golden flame appearing under his feet.
Chen Ping’s figure instantly turned into a streak of golden light, rushing towards the outside of the palace.
The Soul Devouring Venerable did not expect Chen Ping to suddenly use such a fast movement technique. By the time he reacted, Chen Ping had already rushed out of the palace.
“Want to run? No way!”
The Soul Devouring Venerable snorted coldly, his figure flashed, and he chased after Chen Ping.
The two of them, one in front and one behind, shuttled quickly through the streets of the Divine Capital City. The golden light and the black demonic shadow intertwined on the streets, forming a weird yet beautiful scenery.
Chen Ping exerted all his strength to perform the Imperial Fire Step, and his speed had reached the limit.
But the Soul Devouring Venerable’s speed was really too fast, and the distance between the two was constantly shrinking.
“Kid, you can’t escape!”
The Soul Devouring Venerable sneered, his hands already gathering powerful energy, preparing to deliver a fatal blow to Chen Ping.
Chen Ping glanced back at the approaching Soul Devouring Venerable, his heart full of anxiety.
He knew that if this continued, he would eventually be caught by the Soul Devouring Venerable.
“Kid, it seems I really have to disappear…”
The voice of the Red Cloud Demon Lord sounded again in Chen Ping’s sea of consciousness, the voice already becoming extremely weak. “This is the last thing I can help you with…”
After saying that, the faint strand of soul in Chen Ping’s sea of consciousness suddenly burst out with a strong light, followed by a powerful force erupting from Chen Ping’s body.
“What?”
The Soul Devouring Venerable’s expression changed. He could feel that Chen Ping’s speed suddenly became faster, even a bit faster than his own.
It turned out that at the last moment of disappearance, the Red Cloud Demon Lord injected all his remaining power into Chen Ping’s body, helping Chen Ping to instantly increase his speed.
Chen Ping’s figure turned into a golden lightning bolt, disappearing at the end of the street in an instant.
The Soul Devouring Venerable looked at the disappearing Chen Ping, his face showing unwillingness. “Damn it! He escaped again!”
He knew that it was too late to chase now.
Although the last burst of power from the Red Cloud Demon Lord was strong, it could not last long.
When that power dissipated, Chen Ping’s speed would return to normal.
But by then, Chen Ping would have run away without a trace.
“Kid, you wait for me!”
The Soul Devouring Venerable roared angrily. “Next time I meet you, I will definitely make your soul scatter!”
After saying that, the Soul Devouring Venerable turned and walked towards the palace.
He needed to restore his complete physical body as soon as possible, and then go find Chen Ping for revenge.
At this moment, Chen Ping had already run out of the Divine Capital City and arrived at a wilderness outside the city.
He stopped, panting heavily. The escape just now had almost exhausted all his strength.
“Senior Red Cloud, are you still there?”
Chen Ping called out in his sea of consciousness, his heart full of worry.
However, the sea of consciousness was silent, with no response at all.
That faint strand of soul had completely disappeared, leaving only a faint trace to prove that it had once existed.
Chen Ping knew that the Red Cloud Demon Lord had completely vanished.
To save him, the Red Cloud Demon Lord had paid the price of his soul scattering.
“Senior, senior…”
Chen Ping continued to call out, trying hard to search in his sea of consciousness, but there was no trace of Red Cloud’s aura at all.
Chen Ping suddenly fell to the ground. The disappearance of the Red Cloud Demon Lord was too big a blow to him.
He had promised the Red Cloud Demon Lord to help him restore his physical body.
For such a long time, the Red Cloud Demon Lord had helped him time and time again, but in the end, Chen Ping had not fulfilled his promise.
“Senior, how could you just disappear like this? I haven’t restored your physical body yet.”
“I, Chen Ping, have lived an upright life and never owed anyone, but I have let you down…”
Chen Ping wailed and cried, he was truly heartbroken.
