“Young Master Tianci is absolutely right, I just got lucky, saved by Miss Mo.”
Chen Ping said with a sycophantic smile.
“Brother Tianci, can you open this stone gate?”
Mo Qingyun asked Tianci.
“Of course, a mere stone gate can’t possibly block my path!”
Tianci gave a cold smile, then walked to the stone gate. Without any hesitation, a pitch-black short blade appeared in his hand.
Clang!
A flash of cold light shot into the stone gate, but the gate showed no change.
Immediately after, a terrifying force surged forward. Tianci, unable to dodge, was forced back a hundred zhang.
Seeing this, everyone was utterly shocked!
Even Tianci couldn’t budge the stone gate in the slightest!
Chen Ping closely examined the runes on the stone gate. These runes were highly unusual. When the force rebounded just now, the runes seemed to come alive, shifting in different ways, emitting that terrifying power.
Chen Ping’s expression grew serious; this ruin was clearly not easy to explore.
Tianci, pushed back, felt humiliated, his face dark as he approached again.
He gently touched the stone gate with his hand, but it showed no reaction.
“It seems the formation on this stone gate is quite formidable. We need Elder Tong from Tianyuan Pavilion to take a look; he’s well-versed in formations.”
Tianci said calmly.
Chen Ping remained silent. Given time, he could break the stone gate himself. Though the formation was unique, finding the formation’s core and cracking it was no great challenge for him.
However, he was only at the first rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, so he couldn’t afford to reveal too much of his strength in front of others.
A first-rank Loose Immortal who understood the art of formations would surely draw Tianci’s suspicion.
For now, Chen Ping needed to disguise himself as a weakling to dull Tianci’s vigilance.
If there were treasures in this ruin, Chen Ping could seize them unexpectedly.
But if Tianci became wary of him, it would complicate things.
Tianci took out a token and crushed it forcefully.
As the token shattered, a drop of refined blood was forced out by Tianci. The blood spread in the air, turning into a mist of blood.
Soon, the void within the blood mist began to tremble.
Then, an old man with white hair slowly emerged, stepping out of the blood mist.
This was Elder Tong of Tianyuan Pavilion.
“Tianci, why have you summoned me? I was playing chess with the Pavilion Master.”
Elder Tong said.
“Elder Tong, I was exploring this ruin, but there’s a formation on this stone gate that I can’t break.”
“I know you’re skilled in formations, so I’d like to ask for your help to open this stone gate.”
Tianci said to Elder Tong.
Tianci’s attitude towards Elder Tong was far more polite, devoid of his usual arrogance.
Elder Tong nodded slightly, then approached the stone gate and carefully studied the runes on it.
With a wave of his hand, a light curtain appeared, and the runes from the stone gate were projected onto it.
As Elder Tong’s fingers moved, the runes on the light curtain began to shift, rearranging themselves.
Chen Ping could tell at a glance that Elder Tong was searching for the formation’s core.
To forcibly break such an ancient formation required immense strength. But if the formation was cracked by finding its core, it would be much easier.
Chen Ping watched quietly, intrigued by Elder Tong’s method of locating the core.
“This formation is indeed quite tricky!”
Elder Tong frowned slightly, and the light curtain slowly faded.
Then, a mysterious circular glow appeared on the stone gate, spinning continuously, as if gathering some enigmatic power.
