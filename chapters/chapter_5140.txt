Seeing the head of the white-robed youth fall, dozens of cultivators were all shocked, then glared angrily at Chen Ping!
These people wanted to attack Chen Ping, but they were desperately stopped by the girl!
“No one is allowed to move, he brought this upon himself, this fellow daoist did nothing wrong.”
The girl loudly reprimanded these people!
Chen Ping merely cast a cold glance, “Your lives were saved by me, I can take them back anytime, if you don’t want to live, then take back your storage bags!”
Chen Ping’s words made the dozens of cultivators lower their heads in silence, not one daring to move!
They had witnessed Chen Ping’s capabilities, how could they dare!
“Fellow daoist, you saved our lives, we are deeply grateful, someone actually failed to show gratitude and even tried to morally blackmail you, he deserved to die!”
The girl eagerly tried to please Chen Ping, “May I ask your name, fellow daoist, could we follow you?”
The girl knew that relying solely on their group to rebuild the Wuyou Clan would be extremely difficult, and they might all slowly be killed!
Thus, they needed a backer, with a backer, everything would become much smoother!
Now, she wanted Chen Ping to be that backer.
Chen Ping had long seen through the girl’s intentions and snorted coldly, “Fend for yourselves, from now on, we owe each other nothing!”
With that, Chen Ping led Hu Mazi and the others and turned to leave!
Watching Chen Ping’s disappearing figure, the girl sighed helplessly, only able to lead the remaining clan members away, unsure if they could ever revive the Wuyou Clan!
After travelling another thousand miles with Hu Mazi and the others, Chen Ping found a secluded place, instructing Hu Mazi and a few others to guard him while he entered the Demon-Suppressing Tower to recover!
In his current state, it would be impossible to destroy the Tianyan Sect.
Inside the Demon-Suppressing Tower, Chen Ping continuously recovered, no longer needing to worry about resources!
The resources obtained from the Barbaric Ancient Clan and these Wuyou Clan members were enough to sustain him for a while.
While recovering, Chen Ping also began practising the Barbaric Body Refining Technique!
In the Demon-Suppressing Tower, Chen Ping lost track of time, and when he opened his eyes, he found a faint halo enveloping his body!
Taking a deep breath, Chen Ping realised the strength of his physical body was now countless times greater than before!
It had to be said, this Barbaric Body Refining Technique was truly remarkable, greatly aiding in tempering the body!
As his physical strength increased, Chen Ping’s power also grew imperceptibly!
Emerging from the Demon-Suppressing Tower, Chen Ping looked at the sky and said, “Master Hu, how much time has passed?”
“Only three days!” Hu Mazi replied!
Chen Ping knew he had been recovering in the Demon-Suppressing Tower for a full year!
“Chen Ping, how are you, fully recovered?” Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun asked with concern!
“I’m fine, we can set off now, to the Tianyan Sect!” Chen Ping said with a slight smile!
Yun Wuya led the way, and the group headed straight for the Tianyan Sect!
The Tianyan Sect was located at Tianyan Peak, perpetually shrouded in ethereal immortal mist.
The sect’s entrance arch was carved from ten-thousand-year-old mysterious ice, inscribed with the ancient seal characters, “Tianyan Orthodoxy, Eternal Prosperity,” exuding an unquestionable majesty.
When Chen Ping and his group appeared at the Inquiry Platform at the foot of the mountain, they were immediately stopped by two gatekeeping disciples in moon-white robes.
“Who are you cultivators, daring to trespass on Tianyan Sect’s territory?”
The leading disciple glanced at Chen Ping, his gaze sweeping over him.
Seeing that Chen Ping’s aura was restrained, showing no terrifying cultivation fluctuations, his tone carried a hint of contempt, “Our Tianyan Sect is a great sect, we don’t entertain stray cats and dogs, no entry without invitation, leave quickly.”
