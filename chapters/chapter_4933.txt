The excruciating pain seemed to jolt Little Tiger’s nerves, making this punch even fiercer than the last.
Everyone held their breath, watching Little Tiger’s fist, hoping it would knock Chen Ping out cold, as this punch determined their entire fortunes.
“Die!” Little Tiger roared, his fist aiming straight for Chen Ping’s face.
This time, it looked like he wanted Chen Ping dead.
Chen Ping, facing the enraged Little Tiger, gave a cold smirk and casually raised a hand.
With ease, Chen Ping blocked Little Tiger’s fist, stopping it dead in its tracks.
Little Tiger’s massive fist was held back by Chen Ping’s small palm, the stark contrast leaving the crowd breathless, almost frozen in shock.
“Piss off,” Chen Ping said, releasing his grip.
Little Tiger’s towering frame was sent flying, arcing through the air before crashing heavily into the ground, leaving a deep crater.
Silence fell. Everyone stared dumbfounded at Little Tiger, who was spitting blood.
“Anyone else?” Chen Ping scanned the crowd, striking a cocky pose as he asked.
Bai Yi erupted with excitement, “Hahaha, my son-in-law’s a bloody legend, a beast!”
“Nuo Qing, collect the coins!”
Nuo Qing and her team began gathering the immortal coins. The crowd watched their money being taken, hearts aching, but they had no choice—losers pay up.
No one dared cause trouble in the black market. It was an illegal operation, and any fighting would leak energy, quickly attracting the Battle Corps.
“Useless sod!” Bao Hu, furious at the blood-spitting Little Tiger, smashed a fist down, reducing him to a pulp, sending him straight to the underworld.
Seeing Bao Hu’s ruthless act, the crowd instinctively stepped back.
“Bao Hu, it’s just a match, win or lose. Why kill your own man?” Bai Yi asked.
“Mind your own business. Dare to go another round?” Bao Hu demanded, seething.
“Of course I dare. I’m just worried you won’t,” Bai Yi replied with a faint smile.
“Big Tiger!” Bao Hu bellowed.
A massive iron gate creaked open, and out stepped a man nearly ten metres tall, impossibly burly, with a face full of whiskers. Each step he took made the entire Bao Hu House tremble.
At the sight of Big Tiger, Bai Yi’s expression grew serious. The man’s hand was larger than Chen Ping’s entire body.
Noticing Bai Yi’s look, Bao Hu snorted, “Scared now? Let me tell you, Big Tiger’s strength is unmatched. He can move mountains and fill seas with raw power alone. One punch from him carries ten thousand pounds of force.”
“Forget fighting, one stomp from him, and your son-in-law will be nothing but dust.”
Bai Yi looked gravely at Chen Ping, “Son-in-law, can you handle this? If not, we can stop now. We haven’t fully recouped our losses, but we’ve made a decent haul.”
Bai Yi feared Chen Ping couldn’t handle Big Tiger, whose sheer size was daunting. In a contest of raw physical strength, bigger was better.
“Don’t worry, Father-in-law. Let alone a mere ten-metre giant, I’ve never feared even those as big as mountains,” Chen Ping said confidently.
“You’re not just talking big, are you?” Bai Yi worried Chen Ping was bluffing to save face. This was a matter of life and death—no room for posturing.
“I trust my strength. This isn’t bravado,” Chen Ping declared loudly.
“Good. I don’t want my daughter arriving in the Heavenly Realm only to find you dead, leaving her a widow. She’d have my head,” Bai Yi said, dreading the thought of explaining Chen Ping’s death to Bai Qian.
