The man, of course, knew Chen Ping couldn’t possibly be doing this just to “do a good deed.” As the saying goes, no reward without merit, since Chen Ping wanted to save him, he’d have to offer something in return!
Right now, as a prisoner, he had no resources or treasures to give, the only thing he could offer was to serve Chen Ping and work for him!
“Senior, since you’re so sincere, it’d be hard for me to refuse, but could you tell me how to break your prisoner’s mark, and why exactly were you imprisoned here?”
Chen Ping asked!
“Can I not say? It’s embarrassing…” The man’s face turned red!
“If you don’t tell me, how am I supposed to help you?” Chen Ping shrugged!
“Fine!” The man took a deep breath, “Back in the Heavenly Realm, I came across an exceptionally beautiful female immortal, and then…”
“And then what? You took her?” Chen Ping pressed!
“No, no, I didn’t have the guts for that, she was the daughter of a Golden Immortal, how could I dare, I just… secretly watched her bathe…”
By the end, the man’s face was even redder!
“And for that, you got branded with a prisoner’s mark and locked up here?”
Chen Ping said!
The man nodded, his expression full of awkwardness!
“Not worth it, totally not worth it!” Chen Ping shook his head!
“Sigh, in the Heavenly Realm, rogue immortals like me who clawed our way up step by step have the lowest status, finding a dual cultivation partner is near impossible.”
“I couldn’t help myself and did something so ridiculous, you won’t laugh at me, right?”
The man looked at Chen Ping and asked!
“No way, how could I, I’m a man of high morals, I’d never mock others.”
“Unless I can’t hold it in…”
“Hahaha…”
Chen Ping couldn’t help but burst into laughter!
“Damn it!” Seeing Chen Ping laugh, the man’s face turned green, “You’re laughing at me, what, do you have a dual cultivation partner or something?”
“Of course I do, I’ve got over twenty of them, I can barely keep count!”
Chen Ping kept laughing.
Getting locked up in a place like this just for peeking at a woman bathing, it was genuinely hilarious.
“Bragging…” The man shot Chen Ping a skeptical glance!
Chen Ping didn’t say a word, just lightly swung the Dragon-Slaying Sword, and the sword spirit Zhong Li appeared before them!
“A sword spirit…” The man gasped!
“Master!” Zhong Li snuggled into Chen Ping’s arms!
“Senior, want me to put on a little show for you right here?”
Chen Ping asked!
“I’m not watching, you’re so young yet you’ve got a spiritual sword like that, and at third-grade Transcendence Realm, you’ve got the strength to leap an entire realm, there’s definitely someone backing you, you’re just some rich second-generation kid, I’m not comparing myself to you!”
The man turned his head away, refusing to look at Chen Ping!
He’d struggled for thousands of years to finally reach the Heavenly Realm, only to pale in comparison to some privileged kid who effortlessly reached such heights!
Man compared to man is death, goods compared to goods get tossed…
Some people toil their whole lives to reach the Heavenly Realm, while others are born there!
That’s fate, set in stone the moment you’re born!
Chen Ping patted Zhong Li, sending her back into the Dragon-Slaying Sword, then asked the man, “Senior, how do I break your prisoner’s mark, and has your strength been heavily suppressed?”
The man nodded, “I’m down to a third of my strength now, otherwise none of you would’ve passed my first gate.”
“As for breaking the prisoner’s mark, that depends on your skill!”
With that, the man slammed his axe hard into the ground!
The earth instantly glowed with red light, and soon a blood-red seal slowly emerged, covering the entire wasteland, with crimson liquid flowing through every line of the pattern!
“This is the prisoner’s mark, the red liquid inside is my blood, now you need to strip this seal from my body!”
The man said!
“Easy, a seal like this, I can break it with a wave of my hand!”
Chen Ping smiled faintly!
“You’re not bluffing, are you?” The man asked!
