“Miss Hua, thank…”
Chen Ping turned to Hua Yueying, but before he could finish his words of gratitude, he saw her body rapidly falling toward the ground, visibly aging before his eyes!
“Miss Hua…”
Chen Ping was shocked. His body vanished in an instant, and then he caught Hua Yueying in his arms!
Hua Yueying’s face was pale, and her breathing was extremely weak.
“Mr. Chen, I can’t help you anymore after this. You’ll have to rely on yourself. Since I’ve put in so much effort, can you give me a bit more spirit stones?”
Hua Yueying opened her eyes, forcing a faint smile.
“Don’t worry, I’ll give you 100,000, no, 200,000 spirit stones. I will definitely help you break through to the peak of the Great Ascension Realm and reach the Immortal Realm!” Chen Ping said with utmost seriousness.
“That’s good. It’s worth it, even if I had to sacrifice half my lifespan to cast this ‘Heavenly Rain Descent.'”
Hua Yueying smiled. She had taken a gamble by doing this, and now it seemed she had gambled correctly.
“Who dares to cause chaos here and cast the ‘Heavenly Rain Descent’?”
At that moment, a beam of light descended from above, and an old man appeared. He was dressed in a purple Taoist robe, wearing a Taoist crown, and holding a black iron sword that seemed out of place with his attire.
As soon as the old man appeared, the spatial array Chen Ping had set up instantly shattered, and Elder Qian’s divination technique was restored in an instant.
Everyone was stunned and confused by the sudden appearance of the old man.
Lin Kefan, however, brightened up and quickly stepped forward, saying, “Uncle North Domain Lord…”
The old man glanced at Lin Kefan and frowned slightly, “Who are you?”
“Uncle North Domain Lord, I’m Lin Kefan, the fourth prince of Sun Moon City!” Lin Kefan hurriedly introduced himself.
“Oh, so you’re Daoist Lin’s son. No wonder you look familiar.”
“How is your father doing? It’s been a while since I last saw him.”
The North Domain Lord smiled as he asked.
“My father is doing well. Uncle, you should visit Sun Moon City sometime to see him,” Lin Kefan replied.
“Why are you fighting in my North Domain, destroying my mountains and disturbing my peace?”
The North Domain Lord asked.
“Uncle, these people were trying to kill us. We had no choice but to fight back. They were bullying the weak, and it’s utterly shameless. I hope Uncle can uphold justice for us!”
Lin Kefan said with a pitiful expression.
The Ten Hall Masters were furious, their faces turning red.
This was outrageous!
They were the ones who had been chased and attacked in their own territory!
Now, they were being portrayed as the victims!
Was there no justice anymore?
The North Domain Lord glanced at the Ten Hall Masters but didn’t say anything. Instead, he looked at Hua Yueying in Chen Ping’s arms and took out a pill, placing it in her mouth.
Hua Yueying visibly recovered, her face slightly red as she broke free from Chen Ping’s embrace.
“Thank you, Lord North Domain…”
Hua Yueying quickly expressed her gratitude.
“Don’t thank me yet. What’s your name? Why do you know the ‘Heavenly Rain Descent’?”
The North Domain Lord asked with a serious expression.
“My name is Hua Yueying. The ‘Heavenly Rain Descent’ is my mother’s unique skill…”
Hua Yueying replied.
Hearing this, the North Domain Lord became visibly excited. He stepped forward and grabbed Hua Yueying’s shoulders, asking, “Is your mother named Hua Liandie?”
“How does the Domain Lord know my mother’s name?”
Hua Yueying was very surprised.
“How is your mother? Is she doing well?” The North Domain Lord asked eagerly.
“My mother… she has already passed away. She was troubled by inner demons and was consumed during her cultivation.”
Hua Yueying’s eyes welled up with tears.
“What?” The North Domain Lord was shocked, his body trembling uncontrollably. “It’s my fault… I caused her death…”
Seeing this, Chen Ping instantly understood that the North Domain Lord must have had a close relationship with Hua Yueying’s mother.
