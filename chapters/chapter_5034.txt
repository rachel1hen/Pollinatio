Mo Qingyun’s face darkened: “It must be that Huo Zhao. It seems this Eighth Hall Master really won’t let things go easily!”
A cold glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes: “It looks like he’s trying to use others to do his dirty work.”
Lan Lianhua gritted her teeth: “Let’s go! We must head to support immediately!”
The group stood up, ready to leave the floating island.
Chen Ping glanced back at the mysterious island, feeling a pang of reluctance, but with the situation so dire, he could only set aside his exploration for now.
“Once the demon clan is dealt with, I’ll come back to investigate!” he thought to himself.
However, just as they were about to leave, a faint golden light flickered quietly in the depths of the floating island, as if responding to something…
When Chen Ping and the others arrived at the border of Cangxuan Continent, tens of thousands of cultivators from the continent had already gathered there!
The King of Dongmeng Kingdom, the King of Chelie Kingdom, and Ashinu were all leading their respective citizens to resist the Bone-Eroding King’s attack!
When Chen Ping and his group arrived, they saw an endless aura of darkness surging fiercely. The sky was filled with dark clouds, and the air was thick with the stench of slaughter.
“Has the Bone-Eroding King gone mad? Why is he so desperate to fight us?”
Ashinu, full of confusion, gripped his battle axe tightly, awaiting the coming war.
Many cultivators of Cangxuan Continent stood with wide eyes, holding their breath, weapons in hand.
Though the battlefield held tens of thousands of cultivators, it was eerily silent, the atmosphere oppressively heavy. Chen Ping hovered in mid-air, gazing at the darkness before him, even catching a whiff of decay.
A great battle was on the verge of erupting…
Cangxuan Continent had endured the attack of Feihu City, the assault of the Eighth Hall, and now faced the Bone-Eroding City’s invasion…
Each time was a devastating blow to Cangxuan Continent. Once home to hundreds of thousands of cultivators, it could now barely muster tens of thousands.
The cultivators of Cangxuan Continent felt the aura of death around them, their expressions grave, some even trembling unconsciously.
Aisha, though a princess of her nation, stood among the crowd. In this moment of the continent’s survival, even the Mysterious Lady had stepped forward—what was a mere princess?
Rumble…
Finally, movement stirred in the darkness. The ground began to tremble, a terrifying aura rising from the distance as black mist surged like a flood.
“Prepare…”
Lan Lianhua roared, and all the cultivators of Cangxuan Continent readied themselves!
Chen Ping drew his Dragon-Slaying Sword, watching the approaching black mist, which seemed like a massive black wave ready to engulf the entire Cangxuan Continent.
Mo Qingyun and Hu Mazi also prepared themselves. This battle concerned the survival of Cangxuan Continent.
The black mist churned as if alive, tearing the sky into a thick, inky blackness.
Chen Ping’s Dragon-Slaying Sword grew hot in his palm, the ancient runes etched on its spine glowing faintly, as if warning of the impending disaster.
The mysterious golden light from the floating island was long forgotten. At this moment, the fate of the entire Cangxuan Continent hung on this border line about to be swallowed by the black mist.
“Your Majesty, the spiritual energy fluctuations at the northwest defence line have weakened!”
The voice of the Dongmeng Kingdom’s Grand Tutor trembled as the spirit-measuring disc in his hand spun wildly, its needle nearly cracking the dial.
King Che Wuji of Chelie Kingdom tightly gripped the gilded soft sword at his waist, his knuckles whitening from the force: “Pass down the order, have the Shield Armour Battalion retreat three li and form the Tortoise Shell Formation!”
Before his words could settle, the ground suddenly split into web-like cracks, from which oozed a foul-smelling black liquid. The moment it touched a cultivator’s robe, it corroded blackened holes.
A faint blue defensive glow shimmered on Princess Aisha’s silver armour, but her hand gripping the long spear trembled slightly.
