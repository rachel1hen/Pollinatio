Boom! Boom! Boom!
Suddenly, everyone felt a series of terrifying shockwaves erupting from the center of the battle, forcing everyone to stagger backward!
The Tenth Hall Master’s dharma manifestation exploded, transforming into waves of shockwaves!
Chen Ping was also sent flying by the shockwaves, his body feeling as if it were being crushed by a massive mountain.
Seeing this, Hua Yueying continuously cast spells to stabilize Chen Ping’s body. By now, she was already drenched in cold sweat.
As soon as Chen Ping steadied himself, he swung the Dragon-Slaying Sword once more!
Bang!
The sword’s light shattered, and Chen Ping was sent flying again. In front of the Tenth Hall Master, even with all his strength, Chen Ping couldn’t defeat him.
As Chen Ping was sent flying, a gentle force enveloped him, instantly stabilizing his body.
Chen Ping knew this was Hua Yueying’s doing.
Without her assistance, Chen Ping wouldn’t have been able to hold out against the Tenth Hall Master for this long.
The Tenth Hall Master’s expression turned grave, and all traces of his earlier disdain vanished. His right hand was now cracked, blood continuously flowing from it.
The Tenth Hall Master glared coldly at Hua Yueying, his eyes filled with disgust and killing intent.
If it weren’t for Hua Yueying’s assistance, Chen Ping would have already been defeated.
“What is your relationship with Chen Ping? Why are you helping him so much?” the Tenth Hall Master demanded of Hua Yueying.
Hua Yueying smiled faintly. “He pays, I risk my life. That’s the extent of our relationship.”
“Paid mercenaries?”
The Tenth Hall Master was stunned, then glanced at the others. “All of you?”
The others didn’t speak, but they all nodded.
Every one of them had taken Chen Ping’s spirit stones!
“How much did Chen Ping pay to hire you all to come after my Tenth Hall?” the Tenth Hall Master asked.
He was curious. What kind of benefits could have driven these people to risk their lives and oppose his Tenth Hall?
“Ten thousand spirit stones…” Cang Yue raised a finger and said.
“Ten thousand spirit stones?” The Tenth Hall Master was momentarily stunned, then burst into laughter. “Hahaha, how ridiculous! Ten thousand spirit stones, and you’re willing to risk your lives for him?”
“I can give each of you twenty thousand spirit stones. Just leave the Tenth Hall, and the spirit stones will be yours immediately.”
Hearing the Tenth Hall Master’s words, Xuan Bin and the others were all slightly shaken.
“Don’t bother trying to sow discord. No matter how much you offer, it won’t work. We won’t abandon our brother-in-law,” Lin Kefan said quickly, knowing that the Tenth Hall Master was trying to use the spirit stones to break their unity.
This guy, who kept calling Chen Ping his brother-in-law, certainly wouldn’t leave for twenty thousand spirit stones.
The Tenth Hall Master ignored Lin Kefan and turned his gaze to Hua Yueying. “Think about it. If you stop helping Chen Ping, I’ll give you twenty thousand spirit stones right now. If you help me instead, I’ll give you thirty thousand…”
The Tenth Hall Master knew that Hua Yueying, as a formation master, was a significant obstacle to his plans.
Chen Ping glanced at Hua Yueying, curious about what she would choose.
After all, they hadn’t known each other for long, and their alliance was purely based on mutual benefit.
“I’m a person of principle. Since I’ve accepted Mr. Chen’s spirit stones, I must see this through to the end,” Hua Yueying said coldly.
Hearing this, Chen Ping was instantly filled with gratitude toward Hua Yueying. He gave her a thumbs-up and said, “Miss Hua, you’re truly remarkable…”
The Tenth Hall Master frowned, his teeth grinding audibly.
“Tenth Hall Master, are you serious about what you said?” At this moment, the three black-robed cultivators turned to the Tenth Hall Master and asked.
“Of course! I always keep my word. As long as you stop helping Chen Ping and leave the Tenth Hall, twenty thousand spirit stones will be yours immediately,” the Tenth Hall Master declared, pounding his chest in assurance.
“You just said thirty thousand earlier?” one of the black-robed cultivators asked.
“Thirty thousand is for helping me kill Chen Ping,” the Tenth Hall Master clarified.
“Hand over the spirit stones first, and we’ll act,” one of the black-robed cultivators demanded, insisting on receiving the spirit stones upfront.
