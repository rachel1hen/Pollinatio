“They’re here.”
Chen Ping’s voice was low, yet it struck like a thunderclap in everyone’s ears.
Before his words faded, the entire Seventh Hall began to tremble violently, as if a thousand cavalry were charging forward.
From outside the cave came a piercing sound of air being torn apart. Countless black shadows descended like a sudden storm onto the plaza of the Seventh Hall, their dense figures blotting out the sky, surrounding the hall impenetrably.
At the forefront, a black-robed figure hovered in mid-air, nine soul banners flapping fiercely behind him.
The faces on the banners roared with increasing frenzy, a thick miasma of corpse energy and blood mixing together, forming a visible grey wave that surged towards the Seventh Hall.
“Chen Ping, come out and face your death!”
You Wuxie’s voice scraped like a chilling wind from the netherworld, laced with venomous resentment. The green stone ground of the plaza instantly froze with a thick layer of frost, and the few resilient spirit grasses withered in an instant.
The Seventh Hall’s protective mountain array flickered violently under this pressure, countless cracks appearing on the light curtain, as if it would shatter at any moment.
The low-ranking disciples inside the hall were already paralysed with fear, lacking even the courage to raise their heads.
The Seventh Hall Master’s face was ashen, instinctively inching closer to Chen Ping, his voice trembling with a sob, “Chen… Chen Ping, this… this is You Wuxie, with the cultivation of the Earth Immortal Realm, we…”
Chen Ping raised a hand to cut him off, his gaze sharp as a sword, “Stay back, I’ll handle this.”
With that, he stepped forward, and the stone gate slammed shut behind him.
On the plaza, You Wuxie looked down at the figure below, a cruel smile curling under his black robe, “Just you? A mere ant at the sixth level of the Loose Immortal Realm, daring to kill members of my Evil Path Hall?”
The Eight Great Consecrators and Twelve Blood Guards fanned out, encircling Chen Ping completely.
The Eight Consecrators exuded a heavy aura, their pressure that of those half a step into the Earth Immortal Realm, while the Twelve Blood Guards radiated surging bloodlust, their eyes crimson, like bloodthirsty beasts.
“You Wuxie, is it?”
Chen Ping had no patience for idle talk. With a flick of his fingers, the Dragon-Slaying Sword hummed as it left its sheath. A brilliant golden sword aura shot skyward, tearing a rift through the dark clouds above, “The two Nether Elders and Ghost Face, I killed them. If you want revenge, come at me.”
“Arrogant!”
A tall Consecrator roared in anger, a massive bone hammer materialising in his hand, its surface covered in barbs and emanating a thick aura of death, “Kid, let this old man send you to your grave!”
Before his words finished, he leapt forward, the bone hammer crashing towards Chen Ping with the force of a mountain, creating a vacuum in the air with a piercing sonic boom.
Chen Ping’s eyes narrowed, but instead of retreating, he advanced. The Dragon-Slaying Sword traced a sword flower, golden sword aura surging like a tide, colliding with the bone hammer.
“Clang!”
A deafening clash rang out, and at the point where the golden sword aura met the bone hammer, a blinding light erupted. The powerful shockwave sent the surrounding shadow guards flying, and the green stone ground of the plaza shattered instantly, forming a crater dozens of metres wide.
The Consecrator let out a muffled grunt, forced back repeatedly, his palm splitting open, blood streaming down, his face etched with disbelief, “You… how could your strength possibly…”
Before he could finish, Chen Ping appeared before him like a phantom, the Dragon-Slaying Sword flashing like lightning, piercing his throat in a single strike.
“Pfft!”
Blood sprayed out, the light in the Consecrator’s eyes rapidly fading as his body collapsed limply, his face frozen in shock even in death.
One move!
Just one move to slay a Consecrator half a step into the Earth Immortal Realm!
The plaza fell into dead silence, as if even the wind had stopped.
The smile on You Wuxie’s face froze, the pupils beneath his black robe contracting sharply.
The Twelve Blood Guards and the remaining seven Consecrators stood as if struck by lightning, their faces filled with terror.
