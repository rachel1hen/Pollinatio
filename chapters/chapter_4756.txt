Chen Ping was momentarily stunned, then laughed, “Is it just for the reward? If that’s the case, once we leave this place, I’ll reward you with five thousand spirit stones!”
“Only five thousand?” Cang Yue asked.
“What? Don’t want it?” Chen Ping smiled.
“I do, I do, even five hundred would be fine!” Cang Yue nodded repeatedly.
Meanwhile, Xuan Bin and the others looked grave; the strength of the Tenth Hall Master was somewhat beyond their expectations.
“You little trash, do you really think you’re worthy to fight me?”
The Tenth Hall Master swept his gaze over everyone, full of disdain.
Chen Ping coldly stared at the Tenth Hall Master, the Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand emitting continuous dragon roars.
“Whether we’re worthy or not, we’ll only know after trying…”
Various powers surged within Chen Ping’s body.
“Brother-in-law, you didn’t even inform me about such a good thing, I’ve been searching for you so hard!”
At this moment, Lin Kefan’s voice rang out, and then he slowly walked over.
“Why are you here?” Chen Ping was somewhat surprised.
“I was afraid you’d… I was afraid you’d kill this guy too quickly, so I thought I’d better come!”
Lin Kefan laughed.
“Fourth brother-in-law, be careful, this guy’s level is above yours!”
Chen Ping reminded Lin Kefan.
“I know, but if you can fight above your level, why can’t I?”
Lin Kefan had a boastful look.
Seeing this, Chen Ping helplessly rolled his eyes; even at this moment, this guy was still showing off.
The Tenth Hall Master looked at Lin Kefan with a cold expression, “Fourth Prince, does your Sun and Moon City intend to make an enemy of my Divine Hall?”
“Don’t keep mentioning the Divine Hall, you’re just the lowest of the Ten Hall Masters, can you even represent the Ten Halls?”
Lin Kefan sneered.
“Don’t think I’m afraid of your Sun and Moon City, if you provoke me, I’ll kill even you!”
Humiliated, the Tenth Hall Master was full of anger.
“Kill me? Let’s see if you have the ability!”
After saying this, Lin Kefan opened his palm.
A bolt of lightning formed in Lin Kefan’s palm, then shot towards the sky.
The great hall instantly collapsed under this lightning.
Fortunately, these people were all experts and were not injured by the collapsing palace.
In just a moment, Lin Kefan’s body was surrounded by lightning, with terrifying electric currents spreading around.
Seeing this, all the members of the Tenth Hall looked grave.
“Lightning essence, it seems the fourth brother-in-law has some tricks up his sleeve!”
Chen Ping was somewhat surprised to see the lightning essence around Lin Kefan.
No wonder Lin Kefan dared to confront the Tenth Hall Master.
“Mr. Chen, what the Fourth Prince has is Heavenly Thunder, likely obtained from within the Ascension Ladder, not ordinary lightning essence.”
Xuan Bin whispered from the side.
“Heavenly Thunder? Does the Ascension Ladder also have thunder tribulations?” Chen Ping was astonished.
Chen Ping thought that the Ascension Ladder was meant for reaching the heavenly realm without breaking through levels, so how could there be thunder tribulations?
“Mr. Chen, this Heavenly Thunder is even more terrifying than thunder tribulations. Each level of the Ascension Ladder ends with Heavenly Thunder.”
“Only after being tempered by the Heavenly Thunder can one proceed to the next level. Judging by the Heavenly Thunder on the Fourth Prince, it should be from the fifth level.”
“In all these years, I’ve never seen anyone bring out the Heavenly Thunder from the Ascension Ladder. I don’t know what method the Fourth Prince used!”
Xuan Bin was very surprised.
Hearing this, Chen Ping became very interested. If this Heavenly Thunder is more terrifying than thunder tribulations, then if I enter the Ascension Ladder, could I also transform this Heavenly Thunder into my own essence power?
Chen Ping watched as Lin Kefan’s body surged with lightning, then suddenly said to the Tenth Hall Master, “The rolling Heavenly Thunder makes you so scared, it’ll blast you into bits…”
“Scared my foot!”
The Tenth Hall Master snorted coldly, his expression unchanged, as if he wasn’t afraid at all of the so-called Heavenly Thunder on Lin Kefan.
