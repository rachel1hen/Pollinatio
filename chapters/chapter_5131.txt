Following Chen Ping, the two were gradually getting used to it.
At this pace and method, why would they worry about resources? It wouldn’t take long for them to conquer the entire Third Heaven.
Chen Ping gave a slight smile, “No use keeping them, finish them off.”
“Got it!”
Hu Mazi laughed heartily, charging into the fray like a tiger among sheep.
Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun unleashed their divine abilities, and for a moment, screams echoed through Barbarian City, blood flowing like rivers.
“My Barbarian Blood Clan has no grudge against you, why must you wipe us out?”
Faced with the massacre, the Grand Elder couldn’t fathom why Chen Ping wanted to eradicate their Barbarian Clan.
“No grudge?” Chen Ping sneered coldly, “Your Barbarian King, along with Tianyan Sect’s Xuanzhi Zi and Blood Shadow Palace’s Lady Meixin, conspired to seize the ancient relic treasures from me. I nearly died at their hands.”
“If I weren’t strong enough, they’d have succeeded. Though they’re dead now, I’ll make sure their sects are all destroyed!”
Chen Ping’s words left the Grand Elder’s face ashen.
Tianyan Sect, Blood Shadow Palace, and their Barbarian Clan had joined forces and still couldn’t defeat Chen Ping. His strength was unimaginable!
The Grand Elder slowly closed his eyes, knowing the Barbarian Clan was finished, and Tianyan Sect and Blood Shadow Palace would soon follow.
Chen Ping stood with his hands behind his back on the city wall, overlooking the one-sided slaughter with an expression devoid of any ripple, as if watching an inconsequential farce.
For him, wiping out a top-tier Third Heaven force was as easy as crushing a nest of ants.
This was the thrill of power, the exhilaration of being unmatched!
It felt damn good to show off…
Half an hour later, the bustling Barbarian City fell completely silent.
Aside from Chen Ping’s group, not a single living soul remained in the city.
The ground was littered with corpses and blood, turning the ancient city into a scene from hell.
Yun Wuya, standing nearby, was practically scared witless, watching Chen Ping with his hands behind his back, acting like a mere attendant.
Recalling how he once thought to trouble Chen Ping, Yun Wuya felt his scalp tingle!
“Chen Ping, it’s done!”
Hu Mazi wiped the blood from his face, grinning, “These barbarians were quite wealthy, we found plenty of good stuff!”
Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun eagerly presented thousands of storage bags to Chen Ping, “Chen Ping, look! There are loads of immortal stones, herbs, and even some secret technique manuals!”
Chen Ping waved his hand, consolidating all the storage bags. With a sweep of his divine sense, a glint of satisfaction flashed in his eyes.
As one of the top forces in the Third Heaven, the Barbarian Clan’s wealth was indeed substantial. The storage bags contained not only vast quantities of immortal stones but also rare natural treasures and several late-stage Loose Immortal Realm technique manuals.
These manuals would be highly useful for the Mo Family and the Eight Halls!
Without the support of the Divine Hall, the Eight Halls had to rely on themselves, making these manuals and immortal stones all the more necessary!
“Scour this place clean, including their treasury and immortal mines,” Chen Ping said, glancing at Barbarian City.
If these cultivators carried such treasures, the city itself must be hiding even more!
“No problem, I love hunting for treasure!”
Hu Mazi chuckled, leading Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun to methodically search Barbarian City.
Yun Wuya joined in, helping with the search, though he didn’t dare pocket even a single immortal stone!
Chen Ping, meanwhile, headed alone to the core of the Barbarian Clan, the Barbarian King Hall.
The hall was ruggedly decorated, filled with beast bones and furs, and a faint trace of blood lingered on the central throne.
Chen Ping released his divine sense, instantly enveloping the entire Barbarian King Hall, and soon located the true treasury of the Barbarian Clan.
