“Lord Xie, you know these things can’t be gathered in a moment. Allow me to inform Lord Niu to prepare everything within three days and deliver them here.”
“Of course, during these three days, we won’t leave Flying Tiger City, but you must ensure our safety, as well as Niu Ben’s.”
Chen Ping said.
“No problem. As I said, I want territory and resources. Your lives are worthless to me.”
Xie Zhong replied, extending his hand to shake Chen Ping’s.
This negotiation, for Xie Zhong, had gone far too smoothly…
As Chen Ping exited the room, Bai Yi and Mad Immortal immediately approached.
“Big brother, how did it go?” Mad Immortal asked.
“Very smoothly!” Chen Ping smiled.
“Smooth is good. That guy didn’t make outrageous demands, did he?” Mad Immortal said.
Chen Ping shook his head, “It felt reasonable. He only asked for a million immortal coins, a hundred years’ resources from Rhino City’s three southern territories, and the treasure land…”
“What?” Bai Yi was stunned, “And that’s not an outrageous demand? Did you agree to it all?”
“Of course. Even if he asked for the entire Rhino City, I’d agree, since I have no intention of actually giving him anything.”
Chen Ping smirked faintly.
“You’re not planning to give him anything?” Bai Yi blinked in surprise.
“Exactly. I’m just buying time to find a chance to rescue Niu Ben. We won’t give Flying Tiger City a single thing.”
Chen Ping said.
“Big brother, we passed through so many city checkpoints on the way here. Rescuing Niu Ben won’t be easy, will it?”
Mad Immortal frowned slightly.
“There’s always a way to overcome difficulties. We still have time to figure it out!”
Chen Ping said optimistically.
At that moment, Xie Zhong’s men arrived to escort Chen Ping and his group to rest. For the next three days, they were confined to the city lord’s mansion in Flying Tiger City.
After Chen Ping and his group were settled, Xie Zhong gazed toward the western mountain range, his figure slowly vanishing.
When he reappeared, he was already in the small city atop the mountains.
In this city, a group of red-robed cultivators roamed, yet none saluted Xie Zhong, and he seemed accustomed to it.
Xie Zhong then entered a lavishly decorated house, where a masked man sat. The man’s complexion was poor, and upon seeing Xie Zhong, he asked coldly, “Is there a result?”
“Sir, there is. A million immortal coins, a hundred years’ resources, and the treasure land—Rhino City agreed to it all.”
Xie Zhong said excitedly.
“Oh?” The man was visibly surprised, “They agreed that readily?”
“Yes, very readily, and they’ll have everything prepared in three days!”
Xie Zhong nodded.
“I have a feeling that agreeing so quickly isn’t a good sign. You must not let your guard down these three days,” the man said.
“I understand!” Xie Zhong nodded.
The man waved his hand, and Xie Zhong turned to leave.
After Xie Zhong departed, the man coughed violently, his black veil falling away.
If Chen Ping were here, he would surely recognise the man.
It was none other than Huo Zhao, the Eighth Hall Master of the Divine Temple.
Back then, Huo Zhao’s soul had been summoned by Huo Zhenfeng, the Huo family head, using a token. He fought Chen Ping for a long time, with Chen Ping using the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord’s possession to overwhelm him, forcing Huo Zhao to flee in disgrace.
Since escaping, Huo Zhao had been physically weak, requiring vast resources to nourish his body.
Thus, Huo Zhao led the Eighth Hall’s forces to seize control of Flying Tiger City. The current city lord, Xie Zhong, was merely a puppet.
The demand for such immense immortal coins and resources from Rhino City was also Huo Zhao’s idea.
Chen Ping’s guess was correct: the true decision-maker was indeed not in Flying Tiger City’s lord mansion!
