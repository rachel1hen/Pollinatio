The Fourth Hall Master’s eyes turned cold, “Third Hall Master, please mind your words.”
“I am the Fourth Hall Master of the Divine Hall, everything I do is for the future of the Divine Hall!”
“If the Third Hall Master insists on acting alone, don’t blame me for… bringing out the ‘Divine King Token’!”
“You!” The golden-robed old man’s face changed drastically.
The Divine King Token was the highest symbol of authority in the Divine Hall, equivalent to the presence of the Divine King himself!
The Divine King was the highest existence in the Divine Hall, even the First Hall Master would have to bow before him.
The Divine Hall was founded by the Divine King.
Moreover, the Divine King held a revered status among the entire Divine Clan.
If the Fourth Hall Master truly brought out the Divine King Token, even if he could summon the First Hall Master, he would have to yield!
The reason the Fourth Hall Master dared to speak to him in such a tone was precisely because she held the Divine King Token.
“Fine! Very well!”
The golden-robed old man gritted his teeth, “Fourth Hall Master, I hope you won’t regret this!”
With that, he stormed off.
The Fourth Hall Master watched his retreating figure, a trace of coldness flashing in her eyes.
“Chen Ping… I’m curious to see what makes you so special…”
“Hall Master, that Chen Ping seems to be below the Third Heaven, we have no way of meeting him!” a maid beside the Fourth Hall Master said.
“Don’t worry, it won’t be long before he breaks through to the Third Heaven.”
“You inform the Seventh Hall Master to thoroughly investigate Chen Ping’s background, but avoid any conflict!” the Fourth Hall Master instructed.
“Understood!” The maid nodded.
…
In the Second Heaven, Chen Ping stood atop a high peak, where more than a dozen palaces of varying sizes stood, the location of the Eight Halls.
Chen Ping overlooked the mountains and rivers below, feeling a sense of awe, hardly believing he had reached the Second Heaven so quickly!
At this moment, Huo Feng came running over eagerly, fawning, “Brother-in-law, what are you looking at?”
“This boring place, I’m sick of looking at it, nothing worth seeing!”
Chen Ping glanced at him, “I’m thinking… about how to throw you off this mountain.”
Huo Feng’s face stiffened, and he gave an awkward laugh, “Brother-in-law, you sure know how to joke…”
Chen Ping couldn’t be bothered with him, carefully inspecting the defensive arrays of the Eight Halls before vanishing in a flash, reappearing in the main hall, “Father-in-law, the defensive arrays of the Eight Halls need strengthening.”
Chen Ping knew that after the Eight Halls followed him, the rest of the Divine Hall would not let it go easily.
Huo Zhao nodded, “I’ve already ordered people to work on it, but… we don’t have many skilled in array techniques, I’m afraid…”
Chen Ping said calmly, “No matter, I’ll handle it.”
With a flip of his palm, divine patterns instantly appeared between heaven and earth.
Chen Ping had, after all, studied under the Divine Pattern Ancestor and the Array Demon, his array techniques far surpassing others!
“This is…” Huo Zhao looked puzzled.
Chen Ping smiled faintly, “These are divine patterns, far stronger than ordinary array patterns!”
“Once I set up the Nine Heavens Thunder Array, it will protect the entire Eight Halls.”
“When this array is activated, it can summon divine thunder from the nine heavens, even a fifth-grade Loose Immortal would struggle to survive!”
Huo Zhao gasped, “Son-in-law, where did you learn this divine pattern array technique?”
Chen Ping smiled without answering.
He couldn’t possibly say he learned it from the Divine Pattern Ancestor and the Array Demon.
After all, those two were celestial immortals, and Huo Zhao might not even have heard of them!
“Brother-in-law! You’re too amazing!” Huo Feng’s eyes gleamed, “Can you teach me?”
Chen Ping smiled faintly, “Sure, go run a hundred laps around the mountain first.”
Huo Feng, “…”
At that moment, Mo Qingyun hurried over, her expression grave, “Chen Ping, I just received news, my parents are in conflict with the clan!”
“Oh?” Chen Ping raised an eyebrow, “Tell me more.”
Mo Qingyun lowered her voice, “Tianyuan Pavilion has been exerting pressure, and many clan members can’t hold out, so they’re pressuring my parents, now they’re in conflict with the clan.”
“Especially that Mo Qingchen, he’s the most vocal, he’s always wanted to rally the clan to overthrow my father’s position as clan leader.”
