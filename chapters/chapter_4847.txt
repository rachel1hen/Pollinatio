At this moment, Chen Ping descended slowly from midair, steadying himself before looking at Fusheng and saying calmly, “So, got any fight left in you?”
Fusheng gritted his teeth. Though reluctant, he knew full well the gap between them.
Sheathing his sword, he clasped his fists and said, “Chen Ping, your strength is impressive. I, Fusheng, concede. My skills fell short today, I’ve lost this duel.”
With that, he turned and rejoined the ranks of the Eight Swords of Demon Mountain.
The other seven, witnessing Fusheng’s defeat, were stunned beyond belief.
They exchanged glances, a flicker of hesitation in their eyes.
Yet their pride as sword cultivators wouldn’t let them back down, especially with Ming Shao watching from behind.
In unison, the seven drew their swords, encircling Chen Ping, their auras surging to their peak.
“Chen Ping, since you’re so formidable, the seven of us will challenge you together!”
One of them spoke, his voice resolute, tinged with a do-or-die resolve.
Chen Ping eyed the seven surrounding him, showing no trace of fear. Instead, a thrilled grin spread across his face.
“Alright then, let’s see what the rest of you Eight Swords of Demon Mountain, besides Fusheng, are made of!”
His sword intent flared once more, white light enveloping him, making him look like a war god descended to earth. A fiercer battle was on the brink…
“Chen Ping, don’t fall for it! These shameless sods want to gang up on you, don’t take them on!”
Lin Kefan stepped in front of Chen Ping, glaring at the seven sword cultivators with disdain, “Have you lot got no bloody shame? Chen Ping just fought a round, he hasn’t even recovered, and you want seven against one?”
“If you’ve got the guts, fight me! Riyue City’s not short of people, we’ll take you on…”
With Lin Kefan’s words, a bunch of Riyue City cultivators stepped up too!
This left the seven from the Eight Swords squirming awkwardly, at a loss for words!
Ming Shao, watching this unfold, turned to the red-haired old man, “Old Ghost, go have a go at Chen Ping…”
The red-haired old man nodded, “I’ll have Chen Ping’s head off in no time!”
With that, he flickered into motion, transforming into a streak of black light hurtling straight for Chen Ping!
Chen Ping’s face hardened, sensing the terrifying aura closing in fast, his eyes thick with worry!
He’d just fought a big battle, if another高手 came at him now, he’d be outmatched!
“Wheel tactics, is that all the Four Nether Mansions have got? Pathetic…”
A voice boomed across the sky, followed by a fearsome aura sweeping in, instantly suppressing the red-haired old man’s momentum!
Wuji Daoist appeared, whisk in hand, exuding an immortal air as he hovered midair!
Chen Ping had barely finished fighting and hadn’t recovered, yet they struck again. Wuji Daoist couldn’t stand by any longer!
The red-haired old man glared at Wuji Daoist, his voice icy, “Old sod, stay out of this…”
“I’ll shove my foot up your gran’s arse! I’ll do what I bloody well please, come have a go if you’re not happy!”
Wuji Daoist snapped back!
“Let’s have it then!” The red-haired old man didn’t back down, charging at Wuji Daoist.
The two clashed in the void, deafening booms erupting with each strike!
“Your turn…”
Ming Shao glanced at Qian Xiao Han and Huo Zhenfeng!
They nodded, each leading their family’s experts straight for Chen Ping!
“Riyue City cultivators, heed my command, kill…”
Lin Kefan led his Riyue City crew into the fray against them!
Xuan Bin and the others joined in too, diving into the fight!
With blow after blow, both sides packed Ascension Realm heavyweights, so once it kicked off, the whole Wuwang Lands trembled, teetering on the edge of collapse!
Fusheng, seeing everyone else jump in, knew he couldn’t sit it out. With a swing of his longsword, he barked, “Move…”
The other seven sword cultivators unsheathed their blades in unison, slashing towards Chen Ping!
