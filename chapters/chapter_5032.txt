“Today, I will properly entertain our distinguished guests of Cangxuan Continent,” Blue Lotus said!
“To the Floating Island?” Mo Qingyun asked!
“I knew you’d want to go there, I’ve already had it prepared!” Blue Lotus smiled!
“Miss Mo, what is the Floating Island?” Chen Ping asked curiously!
“You’ll see when you get there, it’s very beautiful,” Mo Qingyun replied!
Soon, everyone left the hall, and Blue Lotus noticed three women outside!
One of them was Huo Jingjing, guarded by Hu Mazi’s two women!
To prevent the arrogant Huo Jingjing from self-destructing, Chen Ping had sealed her meridians.
Now, Huo Jingjing was like an ordinary person, unable to self-destruct.
“Who are these three?” Blue Lotus asked curiously!
Mo Qingyun gave a brief introduction, but when Blue Lotus learned Huo Jingjing was Huo Zhao’s daughter, her eyes burned with anger.
Huo Zhao had killed so many people in Cangxuan Continent and plundered so many resources, how could she not be furious?
However, in front of Chen Ping and the others, Blue Lotus refrained from doing anything to Huo Jingjing, as she was their captive.
Moreover, with Huo Jingjing in hand, they could threaten Huo Zhao to stop troubling Cangxuan Continent.
The group flew toward the Floating Island!
While Chen Ping and the others headed to the Floating Island, Huo Zhao, the Eighth Hall Master, led his people to the Demon Clan’s territory.
Before a blood-red city, Huo Zhao paused.
This was the territory of the Bone-Eroding King. Huo Zhao looked at the blood-colored skeleton soldiers on the city walls, waved his hand lightly, and instantly turned them to dust.
“Who dares cause trouble in my Bone-Eroding City?” a furious shout rang out, followed by a burly, imposing demon cultivator appearing on the wall.
Behind him stood thousands of skeleton soldiers, each wielding curved blades, their eyes glowing red, looking terrifying.
“Stop shouting and get down here,” Huo Zhao said coldly.
Seeing this, the Bone-Eroding King trembled slightly, then grinned, revealing gleaming teeth: “So it’s the Eighth Hall Master of the Divine Hall, forgive my lack of welcome…”
The Bone-Eroding King appeared before Huo Zhao in an instant, and the thousands of skeleton soldiers behind him vanished as if into thin air.
“What brings the Eighth Hall Master to my humble abode?” the Bone-Eroding King asked!
“Would you have our Hall Master stand at the gate to speak?” the Great Elder of the Eighth Hall said, frowning.
“Please, come inside…” With a wave of the Bone-Eroding King’s hand, the city gates slowly opened!
Huo Zhao led the Eighth Hall’s people into the city.
If he had any other choice, Huo Zhao would not have come here. As a member of the Divine Clan, he looked down on such demon cultivators.
Demon cultivators like the Bone-Eroding King often cultivated by absorbing the sinister energy of the dead, refining corpses into puppets, and even turning skeletons into soldiers.
Such demon cultivators were despised even among the Demon Clan, and the proud Divine Clan would never willingly associate with them.
But now, Huo Zhao had no choice but to use these people.
In the main hall of Bone-Eroding City, Huo Zhao took the main seat without hesitation, and the Bone-Eroding King didn’t dare protest.
Offending the Divine Hall’s people? He wouldn’t dare, not even with a hundred times the courage.
“Bone-Eroding King, if I asked you to attack Cangxuan Continent, would you be confident?” Huo Zhao asked!
Huo Zhao couldn’t attack Cangxuan Continent himself, as his daughter was still in Chen Ping’s hands, but he could have others do it.
If he didn’t vent this anger, Huo Zhao wouldn’t feel at ease.
“Hall Master Huo, though my Bone-Eroding City has a hundred thousand strong soldiers, compared to Cangxuan Continent, we’re slightly inferior,” the Bone-Eroding King said tactfully!
“Then unite with other Demon Clan members, or even the Beast Clan. You can divide Cangxuan Continent’s resources among yourselves.”
“And I can provide Bone-Eroding City with a million immortal stones, how about that?” Huo Zhao said!
