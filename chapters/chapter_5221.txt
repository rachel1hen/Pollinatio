After leaving, the two didn’t go far. Instead, they stayed hidden on the outskirts of the Crimson Training Sect, waiting for the sect leader to emerge from seclusion.
They knew that only from the sect leader’s mouth could they likely uncover more about the clan extermination.
Days passed, and the Crimson Training Sect’s defences grew increasingly tight, clearly preparing for revenge.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi patiently lurked, observing the sect’s movements.
On this day, a powerful aura suddenly emanated from within the Crimson Training Sect, shaking the entire Snake Coiling Mountain.
“The Crimson Training Sect Leader has emerged!” Hu Mazi’s eyes gleamed with excitement. “Our chance is here!”
Chen Ping nodded, a trace of gravity in his gaze. “The sect leader has broken through to the late stage of the Transformation Stage. Their strength is even greater now. We must be extra cautious.”
The two stealthily infiltrated the Crimson Training Sect, heading towards the source of the aura.
The sect leader’s seclusion site was at the peak of Snake Coiling Mountain, in a grand palace with a red roof shaped like a massive crimson snake, exuding an eerie aura.
The palace was heavily guarded, surrounded by numerous restrictions and venomous snakes, making approach difficult.
“How do we get in?”
Hu Mazi frowned, eyeing the guards and restrictions around the palace.
“Storming in won’t work. We need a plan,” Chen Ping said. “I’ll draw the guards away. You sneak into the palace and gather information.”
“No way!”
Hu Mazi protested. “The sect leader is too strong. It’s too dangerous for you to distract the guards alone!”
“It’s our only option right now.”
Chen Ping said, “Don’t worry, I have a way to escape. Remember, once you get the information, leave immediately. Don’t engage.”
Hu Mazi wanted to argue, but seeing Chen Ping’s resolute expression, he nodded. “Be careful!”
Chen Ping patted Hu Mazi’s shoulder, took a deep breath, channelled his spiritual energy, and charged towards the palace guards.
“Intruder!”
The guards spotted Chen Ping, sounding the alarm and swarming towards him.
Wielding the Dragon-Slaying Sword, Chen Ping moved as if unstoppable, golden sword energy sweeping out, instantly knocking several guards back.
His goal was clear: draw all the guards’ attention to create an opportunity for Hu Mazi.
Inside the palace, a woman in a red robe sat on a throne, sensing the commotion outside, a cold smile curling her lips. “Someone dares to invade my Crimson Training Sect? Truly seeking death.”
The woman was stunningly beautiful, with fair skin, but her eyes carried a chilling coldness. She was the Crimson Training Sect Leader, Crimson Fairy.
She rose slowly and walked towards the palace entrance, eager to see who was so bold.
The moment Crimson Fairy stepped out, Hu Mazi seized the chance to slip into the palace.
Knowing time was short, he immediately began searching, hoping to find records about the clan extermination.
The palace was lavishly decorated, filled with precious treasures, but Hu Mazi ignored them, his gaze scanning the bookshelves and scrolls.
Soon, he found a hidden chamber in a secluded corner.
The chamber’s door was made of special jade, engraved with complex runes that emitted a faint glow.
Hu Mazi knew this must hold important secrets. Using methods from his ancestral teachings, he began working to decipher the runes on the door.
Just as he was on the verge of success, a cold voice sounded behind him: “What are you looking for?”
Hu Mazi’s heart jolted. He spun around to see Crimson Fairy, who had appeared behind him unnoticed, staring at him with icy eyes.
