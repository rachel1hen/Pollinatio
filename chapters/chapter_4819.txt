“Grand Elder!”
The Tang Sect disciples cried out, rushing forward to help, but Chen Ping shot them a cold glance, “This is a one-on-one fight. If you dare move, you’re dead…”
One sentence, backed by an invisible pressure, froze the Tang Sect crew in their tracks.
The Grand Elder struggled to his feet, his eyes brimming with shock and defiance.
He couldn’t believe that he, a mighty fourth-rank Immortal Transformation Realm cultivator, had been pushed this far by a third-rank Transcendence Realm junior.
And without even using a sword, what a miscalculation!
But at this point, there was no backing down!
“Third move, better catch it!”
Chen Ping’s voice rang out again as his ghostly figure appeared right in front of the Grand Elder.
A flicker of despair flashed in the Grand Elder’s eyes, he knew he had to give it everything.
Then, a ruthless glint sparked in his gaze.
“I won’t die!” The Grand Elder bit his tongue, spitting out a mouthful of blood essence. His hands flew through seals as he growled, “Tang Sect Forbidden Art, Ten Thousand Butterflies Devour Soul!”
Instantly, countless black butterflies burst from his body, each one radiating a thick aura of death, enveloping him entirely.
These black butterflies seemed capable of consuming everything, even corroding the air with a sizzling sound.
Chen Ping smirked coldly. Clearly, the Grand Elder wanted his fist to get tainted by these terrifying butterflies, but Chen Ping wasn’t that dumb.
He threw a punch, but just as it neared the Grand Elder, a sword suddenly appeared!
The Dragon-Slaying Sword pierced straight through the Grand Elder’s body, and in the same instant, its sword qi swallowed the black butterflies, reducing them to nothing.
“You… you…”
The Grand Elder’s eyes widened, blood gushing from his mouth, his face twisted with resentment, “You broke your word…”
They’d agreed no sword, and he’d given Chen Ping three free moves!
But on the third, Chen Ping used the Dragon-Slaying Sword, shameless!
Had he known, the Grand Elder would’ve aimed the Ten Thousand Butterflies Devour Soul straight at Chen Ping, no need to waste it trying to taint his fist!
Chen Ping slowly withdrew the sword, looking at the fuming Grand Elder, “Sorry, I didn’t keep my word. My apologies!”
Chen Ping was genuinely apologising to the Grand Elder, his tone sincere!
The Grand Elder’s eyes bore into Chen Ping, his rage so intense he looked ready to tear him apart alive!
Too bad he couldn’t, his body slumped down, lifeless at last!
The Tang Sect Grand Elder was dead!
Stabbed through by Chen Ping’s sword!
“Grand Elder…” The Tang Sect disciples swarmed to his body!
“Chen Ping, you shameless rat, breaking your promise!”
Qian Xiaohan trembled with fury, pointing at Chen Ping and cursing!
“Didn’t I already apologise? I’m really sorry, I couldn’t hold back and pulled out the sword.”
“How about we go another round? I swear I won’t use it this time!”
Chen Ping spread his hands, sounding helpless!
“Shameless! The man’s dead, what’s an apology worth?” Qian Xiaohan’s body shook!
“Fine then, how about I bring him back?”
Chen Ping offered!
“Bring him back?” Qian Xiaohan blinked, staring at Chen Ping in disbelief, “You can resurrect the dead?”
“Piece of cake…”
Chen Ping extended his palm, a scorching flame igniting in his hand!
Everyone watched in stunned silence, holding their breath!
They’d never seen someone kill a man and then bring him back!
“He can resurrect the dead too?” Young Master Ming’s interest piqued. He leapt from the tavern window, joining the crowd!
At that moment, all eyes were glued to Chen Ping!
