You Wuji had mentioned that the Ten Thousand Poison Valley of the Fifth Heaven was also involved in the attack on the Hu clan. Unexpectedly, this Red Serpent Fairy was actually a disciple of the Ten Thousand Poison Valley.
Hu Mazi grabbed the Red Serpent Fairy, dragging her into the side hall like a dead dog.
For the next few hours, the side hall echoed with the Red Serpent Fairy’s screams and pleas for mercy, her voice growing weaker until it finally faded completely.
When Hu Mazi emerged from the side hall, a satisfied smile spread across his face, his body covered in blood.
“It’s done.”
Hu Mazi said, “This demoness has finally paid for my clan’s lives.”
Chen Ping nodded, “Good. The Red Serpent Sect has been wiped out. Now, we wait for You Wuji’s news.”
The trio left the Red Serpent Sect, finding a secluded valley before entering the Demon-Suppressing Tower to rest.
The battles of the past few days had drained their spiritual energy, and they needed to recover.
Hu Mazi, thrilled at having avenged his clan, was too excited to sleep, pulling Nan Batian to drink with him.
Chen Ping, meanwhile, sat in meditation, consolidating his cultivation.
He knew that heading to the Fifth Heaven would bring greater challenges, and he needed to boost his strength quickly.
Three days passed in a flash.
Chen Ping, Hu Mazi, and Nan Batian returned to the Black Fiend Demon Palace.
However, upon reaching the palace gates, they found it eerily quiet, not a single guard in sight.
“Something’s off,” Chen Ping frowned, “Why is it so quiet?”
Hu Mazi also sensed something was wrong. He kicked open the palace gate, shouting, “You Wuji! Get out here! Your Grandpa Hu has arrived!”
The hall was empty, not a soul in sight.
Dried bloodstains covered the floor, and cobwebs filled the corners, as if no one had lived here for a long time.
“Where is everyone?” Hu Mazi said, puzzled, “Did they run?”
Chen Ping stepped into the hall, carefully observing the surroundings.
He noticed that the treasures and scrolls in the hall were gone, clearly taken away deliberately.
“We’ve been tricked!”
Chen Ping’s face darkened, “You Wuji never gathered information for us. He’s long gone!”
“What?”
Hu Mazi was furious, “That old bastard! He dared to play us? I’ll track him down and skin him alive!”
He cursed loudly in the hall, trembling with rage.
Nan Batian’s expression also grew grim, “I didn’t expect You Wuji to be so cunning, daring to toy with us.”
Chen Ping took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm down, “No point getting angry now. You Wuji’s gone, so we’ll have to go to the Fifth Heaven ourselves to gather information.”
“Exactly!”
Hu Mazi gritted his teeth, “Let’s head to the Fifth Heaven now, find the Evil Path Hall’s branch, and save my clan’s souls!”
Nan Batian nodded, “Good idea. The Fifth Heaven is more prosperous than the Fourth, with richer cultivation resources. It’s perfect for boosting our strength.”
The trio decided immediately to head to the Fifth Heaven.
Nan Batian tore open the void, and they flew toward the Fifth Heaven.
Passing through the spatial rift, they arrived at the Fifth Heaven.
The spiritual energy there was several times denser than in the Fourth Heaven, instantly refreshing them.
The mountains were grander, the sky tinged with a faint purple, and the air thick with spiritual energy.
Chen Ping nodded, “Let’s find a place to settle first, then gather information about the Evil Path Hall’s branch.”
While Chen Ping and the others searched for a foothold in the Fifth Heaven, deep within the Divine King Palace, in an elegant hall, the Fourth Hall Master stood by a window.
Dressed in a plain white gown, her dark hair cascaded like a waterfall, her face serene yet carrying a steadiness beyond her years.
