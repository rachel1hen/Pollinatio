Hu Mazi’s brows twitched, “Chen Ping, easy now. I didn’t say I could definitely take him!”
“No worries, Master Hu. I’ve got mates in the Heavenly Realm, plenty of ‘em!”
Chen Ping said breezily!
Whether the figure on the platform was rattled by Chen Ping’s bravado or something else, they stayed silent, as if mulling things over!
Then the figure slowly descended from the platform!
As they drew closer, the group saw a person clad in a pitch-black robe, wearing a mask that left only their eyes visible!
Chen Ping rolled his eyes internally. Lesson learned, anyone hiding their face behind a mask was usually up to no good!
The memory of being played by that bastard Ning Zhi still stung!
“Where are you lot from?” the figure asked Chen Ping.
“I’m from the Mortal Realm!”
Chen Ping answered.
“I’m from the Wuxu Realm,” Xiu Rui chimed in!
“I know you, been locked up for centuries!” the figure said to Xiu Rui!
Xiu Rui’s face flushed with embarrassment!
“Your granddad here’s from the sixth heaven of the Heavenly Realm,” Hu Mazi sneered at the masked figure!
“Sixth heaven?” The masked figure paused, sizing Hu Mazi up, “You’ve got the bones of an immortal, alright. So why’d you come through the Great Path’s guidance?”
“None of your bloody business where I feel like coming from!”
Hu Mazi threw the masked figure’s own words back at them!
The masked figure was left speechless by the comeback!
Hu Mazi did have immortal bones, but whether he was truly from the sixth heaven, the figure couldn’t tell!
Still, they didn’t dare provoke him. If Hu Mazi was really a sixth-heaven immortal, picking a fight would be like poking a tiger’s arse!
“You’re just first-tier Immortal Transformation, yet you made it through the Great Path’s guidance. Looks like you’ve got some skills.”
“I heard you say you know folks in the Heavenly Realm. Who’re we talking about? Let’s hear it!”
The masked figure pressed!
“Better not say. You probably wouldn’t know ‘em anyway. Your realm’s too low to even cross paths with them!”
Chen Ping said coolly!
And he wasn’t lying. This was only the first heaven of the Heavenly Realm. According to Hu Mazi, the first three heavens were just Loose Immortals and monks guided by the Great Path!
No big shots here. Proper immortals wouldn’t bother with the riffraff below the third heaven!
So even if Chen Ping named names, this figure likely wouldn’t know them!
“Big talk! Go on, drop a few names!”
The masked figure thought Chen Ping was just bluffing!
A first-tier Immortal Transformation monk, no matter how talented, knowing Heavenly Realm heavyweights? No chance!
“You know the Limitless Saint Sect of the Heavenly Realm?”
Chen Ping asked.
The masked figure shook their head!
Chen Ping eyed them, “You’re a demon, aren’t you?”
“Yep, I’m a demon!” The masked figure nodded!
“That makes things easy. I know Blood Demon, Yin Demon, Wind Demon, and Array Demon of the Heavenly Realm.”
“And the Red Cloud Demon Lord from the ninth heaven? That’s my mate!”
Chen Ping said to the masked figure!
“Utter nonsense, you trying to pull one over on me?”
The masked figure snorted coldly!
Chen Ping blinked, then said, “What’s the point of lying? I really know them. Red Cloud Demon Lord’s my brother!”
“You’re new to the Heavenly Realm, aren’t you? Don’t know the rules yet. Ninth heaven with a Demon Lord? Demon Lords are up in the twenties! The best you’d get in the ninth is a Heavenly Demon.”
“You pulling a fast one like I’m some kid? Ninth-heaven Demon Lord? Think any old demon immortal can just be a Demon Lord?”
The masked figure gave Chen Ping a proper dressing-down!
“What?” Chen Ping was thrown, then sent his consciousness inward to the Red Cloud Demon Lord, “Senior, what’s the deal?”
“What’s what?” Red Cloud Demon Lord played dumb.
“I’m asking, what’s your realm? Was that guy right?”
Chen Ping demanded!
