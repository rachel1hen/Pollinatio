Seeing Chen Ping, the Tenth Prince’s eyes narrowed, a cold glint flashing within them.
The Lord of the Ten Halls, however, stood up and scrutinized Chen Ping. “So, you’re Chen Ping?”
“That’s right, I’m Chen Ping. Are you the one who offered 100,000 spirit stones for my life?” Chen Ping asked the Lord of the Ten Halls.
The Lord shook his head. “Not me. You’re not worth 100,000 spirit stones.”
“Not worth it?” Chen Ping frowned slightly, then suddenly slashed his sword toward the Lord of the Ten Halls.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword erupted with a dazzling light, illuminating the entire hall as bright as day.
Chen Ping had struck first to gauge the true strength of the Lord of the Ten Halls.
“How dare you disrespect my father!” The Tenth Prince, who was short and childlike, suddenly roared, charging forward and throwing a punch at Chen Ping’s sword light.
“You little brat, how dare you disrespect Mr. Chen!” Xuan Bin shouted, rushing toward the Tenth Prince.
*Boom! Boom!*
Two explosive sounds rang out as Xuan Bin and the Tenth Prince were both forced back.
Their strength was evenly matched.
Meanwhile, Chen Ping, caught in the shockwave of their clash, was also pushed back.
The Lord of the Ten Halls remained standing on the stone steps, a faint smile on his face, as if he didn’t take Chen Ping and his group seriously at all.
Xuan Bin stood beside Chen Ping, glaring at the Tenth Prince, who returned the stare with equal intensity, both eyes filled with murderous intent.
The Lord of the Ten Halls clapped his hands lightly and smiled. “You really have some nerve, coming here with just a few people. Are you here to deliver yourselves to death?”
Chen Ping sneered. “Deliver ourselves to death? No, I’m here to send you to your grave…”
“Is this all you’ve got? Call in everyone outside. Let’s see if you’re worth my time,” the Lord of the Ten Halls said coldly.
“Just us are enough to destroy your Ten Halls,” Xuan Bin declared loudly.
“Such arrogance…” The Lord of the Ten Halls’ eyes narrowed, and his body instantly transformed into a streak of light, disappearing.
Xuan Bin was startled, his pupils contracting. He swung his palms forward, creating a barrier in front of them.
*Boom!*
With a deafening crash, the barrier shattered, and Xuan Bin was sent flying.
A peak ninth-level Great Ascension cultivator, defeated in a single strike!
Xuan Bin’s face turned pale, and blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.
“Are you okay?” Chen Ping asked, looking at Xuan Bin.
Xuan Bin shook his head. “I’m fine… I won’t die…”
“The Lord of the Ten Halls’ strength isn’t that impressive…” Chen Ping had already assessed the Lord’s power from that single strike.
If a peak ninth-level Great Ascension cultivator couldn’t be killed in one hit, it meant the Lord of the Ten Halls’ cultivation level wasn’t exceptionally high.
At most, he was at the third level of the Transcendent Immortal Realm, or even lower.
If that was the case, Chen Ping had nothing to fear.
“Hmph, this level of strength is more than enough to kill you,” the Lord of the Ten Halls snorted, throwing a punch that twisted the surrounding space.
Chen Ping’s eyes narrowed. Just as he was about to strike with his Dragon-Slaying Sword, he noticed Cang Yue beside him had already erupted with power, his eyes filled with ferocity as he charged at the Lord of the Ten Halls.
*Boom!*
Another explosion echoed, and a terrifying shockwave spread in all directions. Cang Yue’s body was sent flying.
Chen Ping was also forced back, but he was quickly stabilized by a force.
Even Cang Yue, who had been sent flying, was suspended mid-air and gently lowered to the ground.
It was Hua Yueying, who had activated a formation to stabilize Chen Ping and Cang Yue.
“You’re no match for the Lord of the Ten Halls…” Chen Ping said gratefully, looking at Cang Yue’s cracked right arm.
Cang Yue, however, smiled nonchalantly. “That Lord of the Ten Halls is something else. Even my body couldn’t withstand that strike. I wonder if Mr. Chen could reward me a bit more for this effort?”
