“Oh, so you brought me here, isn’t it to fight in the arena?” Chen Ping asked, puzzled.
“It is to fight in the arena, but not at our own place. I’m first letting you get familiar with the place. This will be our family’s business in the future, and you’ll help me manage it.”
“Before, it was just me, always swamped with work, utterly exhausted. Now that you’re here, I should be able to take it easier.”
“The immortal coins and resources this black market earns daily should be enough for your cultivation.”
“In a bit, I’ll take you to smash someone else’s black market. Don’t you dare embarrass me!”
Bai Yi instructed Chen Ping firmly.
“Father-in-law, rest assured, I absolutely won’t let you down.”
Chen Ping patted his chest, guaranteeing.
At that moment, Chen Ping suddenly realised this father-in-law had a bit of the vibe of a mafia godfather from the mortal world.
Unknowingly, he had become the mafia’s son-in-law, even going out to smash rival turf…
Bloody hell, life in the Heavenly Realm wasn’t much different from the mortal world.
For fame, for resources, for passions and desires, fighting and killing…
“Ruo Qing…”
At this moment, Bai Yi called out!
Soon, a middle-aged man in white robes appeared, bowing respectfully, “Market Master…”
“Go gather some men. We’re heading to Tiger Den Market to smash their turf. Last time, that Tiger took a lot of immortal coins from us. This time, we’re taking it back.”
“This is my son-in-law. From now on, he’ll be the second-in-command of Spirit Fox Market. Get to know him.”
Bai Yi said to Ruo Qing.
Ruo Qing glanced at Chen Ping, his eyes filled with a mix of doubt and confusion.
A guy at the first rank of the Immortal Transformation Realm, how did he become Bai Yi’s son-in-law?
And the second-in-command of Spirit Fox Market?
But with Bai Yi present, Ruo Qing could only say to Chen Ping, “I hope the young master will guide me in the future.”
“No problem, no problem…” Chen Ping nodded repeatedly!
Ruo Qing left to gather the men.
Bai Yi, meanwhile, took Chen Ping, Hu Mazi, and Xiu Rui for a tour around the black market, so Chen Ping could get familiar with it.
After Ruo Qing had gathered the men, Bai Yi led everyone out of the black market, heading towards Tiger Den Market.
Bai Yi and his group soon arrived at Tiger Den Market. Like theirs, it was in a highly concealed location, surrounded by arrays.
Passing through the array to enter Tiger Den Market, it seemed these black markets were all similar, hidden underground in Rhino City, with entrances and exits concealed by arrays.
Upon entering Tiger Den Market, Chen Ping noticed it was slightly larger than Spirit Fox Market, but the facilities and conditions were less refined, appearing somewhat crude.
“Old Bai, not convinced, eh? Here to smash my turf?”
At this moment, a tall, burly middle-aged man with a broad back approached.
“Tiger, last time you smashed my turf and won a load of immortal coins and resources. This time, of course, I’m here to smash yours.”
Bai Yi looked at Tiger and said.
“No problem, I welcome you to try smashing my turf anytime, as long as you’ve got the skill.”
“But it seems you don’t have any physically strong fighters, do you? And I heard you went to the official arena to scout for talent.”
“Have you gone senile? The official arena is a joke now, full of cheaters. Where can you find real warriors there?”
Tiger sneered, his eyes mocking as he looked at Bai Yi.
“Tiger, don’t get too smug. Today, I’ll let my son-in-law take on the warriors of your Tiger Den Market.”
Bai Yi said coldly!
He had seen Chen Ping’s physical strength the night before, so he had confidence in him.
“Son-in-law? Since when do you have a daughter?” Tiger asked, utterly confused. “I’ve known you for centuries, and I’ve never seen you with a daughter.”
“My daughter isn’t in the Heavenly Realm. This son-in-law of mine has just arrived through the Great Path’s guidance.”
Bai Yi said proudly.
