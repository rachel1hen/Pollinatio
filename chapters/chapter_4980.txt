“Big brother, but all these battle soldiers are wearing armour, and we don’t have any!” Mad Immortal asked.
“That’s easy, wait here for me!”
After speaking, Chen Ping’s figure instantly vanished!
When he returned, he was holding four sets of armour, likely stripped from some battle soldiers!
“Quickly put on the armour. I’ve dealt with the bodies of these four soldiers, they won’t be discovered for a while.”
As he spoke, Chen Ping began putting on the armour himself!
Soon, the four of them donned the armour and concealed their auras!
With this, they could swagger around without anyone suspecting them!
“You four, have you found anything?”
At that moment, a group of battle soldiers approached, and their captain asked Chen Ping and his group.
“Report, nothing found!”
Chen Ping replied!
“How strange, could those four really have vanished?” The captain was full of doubt.
“We’ll keep looking elsewhere, maybe we’ll find them!”
After speaking, Chen Ping prepared to lead Mad Immortal and the others away.
“No need to search, come back to the city with me. Those four won’t escape this area.”
The captain said!
Hearing this, Chen Ping felt a bit helpless but had no choice but to blend into the group and follow the captain back to the city!
“How’s it going? Found them?”
The youth saw the captain return and asked!
“Young Master, it’s as if those people have vanished. We’ve searched the entire area, but there’s no trace, no aura at all.”
The captain spoke cautiously!
“Useless! Tomorrow, send more people to search, they can’t have left this area.”
The youth said coldly!
“Yes, sir!” The captain replied nervously.
The youth turned to leave, but the captain hurriedly followed, saying, “Young Master, with unidentified people about, for your safety, you should have someone accompany you.”
After speaking, the captain waved at Chen Ping’s group, “You lot, protect Young Master Huo. If anything happens to him, none of you will live!”
The youth didn’t object and led Chen Ping and dozens of battle soldiers to stroll through the city streets.
On the streets, everyone who saw the youth immediately stopped, knelt, and paid their respects.
But the youth wore a cold, arrogant expression, not even glancing at those kneeling by the roadside.
“What’s this guy’s deal? Why’s he so impressive? Everyone’s kneeling to him?”
Seeing this, Mad Immortal whispered.
“Even in the First Heaven, I’ve never heard of such an impressive human. Could this youth be from the Third Heaven?”
Bai Yi was also puzzled about the youth’s identity, which made the entire beast clan city willingly kneel to him.
“Enough, stop talking!”
Chen Ping warned!
They were still not out of danger, and if they were carelessly discovered, it would be trouble!
After speaking, Chen Ping fixed his gaze on the youth, his heart full of doubt!
Looking at this youth, he felt a strange sense of familiarity, yet he couldn’t recall where he might have seen him.
“Brother, this Young Master Huo is so arrogant, so many people kneeling, and he doesn’t even glance at them!”
Chen Ping struck up a conversation with one of the battle soldiers!
“Shh…” The soldier was startled, “Are you mad, daring to talk about Young Master Huo like that?”
“Let me tell you, Young Master Huo is from the Temple. If he even glances at us, that’s him thinking highly of us.”
Hearing this, Chen Ping was stunned. He hadn’t expected this youth to be from the Temple.
No wonder he acted so superior, he was from the God Clan.
Clearly human, yet they claimed their bloodline was so noble, the God Clan was the best at putting on airs.
Now Chen Ping understood why Flying Tiger City feared a human, it was because he was from the Temple!
Buzz…
Suddenly, Chen Ping seemed to recall something, his eyes once again fixed on the youth!
