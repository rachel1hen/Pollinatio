Hearing the words of the masked man, Chen Ping couldn’t help but sigh. It seemed that finding Su Yuqi and Ning Zhi wouldn’t be so easy!
“Can we leave this wretched place now?” Chen Ping asked the masked man.
“Of course, of course, please take your time…” The masked man was extremely polite.
He had to be polite, didn’t he? Though Chen Ping’s realm wasn’t high, he carried the aura of three clans, clearly backed by someone powerful!
Not to mention, he knew so many notorious figures, whether real or not, the masked man wasn’t about to test their authenticity!
And then there was Hu Mazi, with his immortal bones and rough manner of speaking. If provoked, the masked man wouldn’t come out unscathed!
“Once we leave this place, will we be in your Demon Clan’s domain? If so, won’t people target us?” Hu Mazi asked.
“Leaving here doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll end up in the Demon Clan’s domain. I’ll send you back into the Great Path’s conduit, but as for where you’ll be transported, I’ve no idea!” the masked man replied honestly.
“That’s fine then, send us off!” Hu Mazi nodded.
The masked man raised his right hand, then waved it forward.
Whoosh!
A beam of white light suddenly appeared before Chen Ping and the others, just like the white light they’d seen in the Heavenly Ladder!
Seeing it, Chen Ping and his companions realised they’d been intercepted within the Great Path’s conduit, forcibly dragged into this cage!
It seemed that for cultivators from lower realms, dreaming of reaching the Heavenly Realm through the Great Path’s conduit wasn’t exactly a blessing!
Taking shortcuts on the path of cultivation was best avoided!
As Chen Ping and the other two stepped into the white light, they felt their vision blur instantly, followed by countless stars streaking past their eyes!
This time, Chen Ping didn’t faint, so he could clearly see the stars flashing by!
In that moment, he felt as though he were standing in the midst of a cosmic galaxy!
“How magnificent, is this what it feels like to be the Master of the Universe?” Chen Ping exclaimed in awe.
To become the Master of the Universe, able to crush a world with ease or wipe out an entire cosmos at will, that feeling must be exhilarating!
While Chen Ping was still immersed in the cosmic galaxy, his vision suddenly went dark!
Then, with a flash of white light, a vast expanse of grassland appeared before them!
Blue skies, lush green plains, but no cattle or sheep. If there had been, Chen Ping might’ve mistaken it for the great prairies of the mortal world!
Here, the air was no longer filled with spiritual energy, but with immortal energy instead!
Though Chen Ping was only at the first rank of the Immortal Transformation Realm, his Heart Condensation Technique could refine immortal energy, so it didn’t affect him.
“Master Hu, when we were being transported just now, did you see the cosmic galaxy?” Chen Ping asked.
“Cosmic galaxy?” Hu Mazi and Xiu Rui both looked puzzled.
They shook their heads, saying, “I didn’t see anything, it was all dark. You saw the cosmos?”
Hearing this, Chen Ping found it odd. Could it really be that only he saw the cosmic galaxy?
“I didn’t see it either, just asking!” Chen Ping, unable to explain, simply said he hadn’t seen it.
“What is this place? I wonder if it’s the Human Clan’s domain. If it’s another clan’s territory, we might be in trouble!” Xiu Rui said worriedly.
“This place is so beautiful, it must be the Human Clan’s domain. Look at this grass, look at this sky…”
“And the air is fresh, with a hint of floral fragrance. It’s truly a paradise on earth!” Chen Ping was quite fond of the place.
“If you like it so much, why not settle here? Maybe you’ll even meet a few Human Clan beauties,” Hu Mazi teased with a laugh.
“Forget it, let’s get moving. We should find someone to ask where we are first.”
Chen Ping leapt into the air, hovering mid-sky!
