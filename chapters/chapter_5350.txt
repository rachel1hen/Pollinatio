Luoxia Valley lived up to its name. At this moment, it was dusk, with the sky full of rosy clouds sprinkling over the valley, dyeing the pink flower trees all over the mountains and fields even more brilliantly.
By the stream in the centre of the valley, the divine clan princess dressed in a white skirt was sitting on a bluestone, her fingertip lightly tapping the water surface. Golden divine patterns rippled in the water. It was precisely the woman previously rescued by Chen Ping and Hu Mazi.
Chen Ping hid behind a tree, watching the sorrow between her brows, without rashly revealing himself.
It was not until the setting sun completely sank below the horizon, and twilight enveloped the valley, that when the princess stood up to leave, he suddenly made his move.
A strand of golden spiritual energy instantly wrapped around the princess’s wrist, firmly sealing her divine powers.
The princess turned back in shock and anger, seeing Chen Ping who appeared out of thin air, her eyes full of vigilance. “It’s you! What do you want?”
“To take you back to the Divine Kingdom.”
Chen Ping’s tone was flat, his fingertip tightening the spiritual energy. “The Divine Kingdom is searching for you everywhere. Rather than being caught by the divine guards and punished, it’s better to come with me. At least I won’t lay hands on you like they would.”
The princess struggled to break free, but Chen Ping’s spiritual energy was as firm as iron clamps. She mobilised her internal divine power, golden divine patterns lighting up around her body, yet they were instantly suppressed by the evil-breaking talisman Chen Ping struck with his other hand. “Don’t waste your effort. Your cultivation is inferior to mine. Struggling further will only bring you suffering.”
“Impossible, you’re just a first-grade Earth Immortal realm cultivator, how could you possibly trap me…” The princess did not believe it, continuing to struggle.
But no matter how she struggled, she could not break free from the restraints.
“Even if I am first-grade Earth Immortal realm, you’re still no match for me. Better to obediently come with me!”
Chen Ping smiled faintly.
“I’d rather die than return to the Divine Kingdom!”
A flash of determination appeared in the princess’s eyes, and she actually intended to circulate her divine power to harm herself.
Seeing this, Chen Ping’s expression turned cold. He stepped forward, reaching out to grab her skirt hem, making a motion as if to pull it down. “If you dare to die, I’ll ruin your chastity right now.
Do you think the Divine Kingdom would still use a divine clan princess who has lost her virginity for marriage?
At that time, not only will you fail to save yourself, but the people you want to protect will also be implicated by you.”
The princess’s body stiffened, the determination on her face instantly replaced by terror.
As a divine clan princess, the education she received since childhood was that chastity was more important than life. If she were truly defiled by this human clan cultivator, she would not only become the laughingstock of the Divine Kingdom, but her father, for the sake of face, might really take action against the people around her.
“You… you dare!”
The princess’s voice carried a tremble, yet she dared not struggle anymore, only glaring at Chen Ping with hatred. “What exactly do you want? I’ll go with you, but if you dare to disrespect me, even if I have to risk my life, I’ll drag you down with me!”
Chen Ping released his hand, retracting the spiritual energy. From his storage bag, he took out an immortal-binding rope, gently binding her hands. It appeared as a restraint, but in reality, he left some leeway, so it would not injure her.
“Rest assured, I only need you to take me into the Divine Kingdom’s imperial palace. Naturally, I’ll let you go. Before that, you’d better obediently listen, otherwise I’ll drop my trousers and have you.”
Chen Ping spoke like a crude fellow to the princess.
Upon hearing this, the princess immediately blushed, her legs involuntarily clamping together. She did not expect Chen Ping to utter such vulgar words.
The princess bit her lip, looking at the immortal-binding rope on her wrists, her eyes full of humiliation, yet in the end, she said nothing more.
Chen Ping spoke no further, taking her as he rose into the air, flying towards the direction of the Divine Kingdom’s Divine Capital.
After flying in the air for about eight hours, the scenery ahead suddenly changed.
The originally sparse clouds became dense like cotton, emitting a faint golden light. The immortal energy in the air was so rich it almost condensed into dew. Inhaling a breath made one’s meridians feel slightly hot.
Below was no longer the rugged rocks of ordinary mountain ranges, but a vast and boundless plain.
