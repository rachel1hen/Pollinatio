It all came back to Chen Ping now.
No wonder the youth looked familiar, he bore a striking resemblance to that Huo Zhao.
Back in the Land of No Return, Chen Ping had clashed with Huo Zhao. At the time, Huo Zhao wasn’t in his true form, but had been summoned.
Even so, Chen Ping was no match for him, and only managed to defeat Huo Zhao by relying on the possession of the Red Cloud Demon Lord.
This youth was very likely Huo Zhao’s son.
At this thought, Chen Ping’s heart grew tense. He had only just arrived in the Heavenly Realm, could he really be running into someone from the Temple so soon?
He had a deep grudge with the Temple, and if they knew he was now in the Heavenly Realm, they would surely spare no expense to hunt him down.
Chen Ping’s only thought was to leave Flying Tiger City as quickly as possible and avoid exposing his identity.
His top priority now was to increase his strength. Once his power grew, he wouldn’t fear the Temple’s pursuit!
Another urgent matter was to find Su Yuqi and Ning Zhi as soon as possible.
Both had been guided to the Heavenly Realm by the Great Dao. If they ended up in human territory, that would be fine, but if they landed in beast or demon clan territory, it would be trouble.
Chen Ping was still unaware that the bloodlines of Su Yuqi and Ning Zhi had long since turned demonic.
And so, Chen Ping and his group obediently followed behind Young Master Huo.
Watching his pompous demeanour, Chen Ping badly wanted to give him a beating, but he held back.
Soon, Young Master Huo arrived at a mansion, lavishly decorated. Stopping at the entrance, he waved a hand and said, “You all go back, I’m heading home!”
“Yes, sir!” The group of battle soldiers halted.
After Young Master Huo entered the mansion, a white light soon flashed within, and as the light shot skyward, his figure vanished.
Staring at the white light, Chen Ping frowned slightly. That guy had a teleportation array in his courtyard, it seemed he had used it to transport himself to the small city in the mountains.
If his guess was correct, Huo Zhao was likely in that small city.
“Alright, disperse.”
One of the battle soldiers waved a hand, and the group scattered.
These soldiers weren’t keen on staying disciplined. Now dismissed, they could shed their heavy armour and rest comfortably.
One by one, the soldiers removed their armour, but Chen Ping and his group kept theirs on.
“Brother, we’ve been dismissed, why are you still wearing your armour? Don’t you want to rest?”
At that moment, the soldier who had spoken to Chen Ping earlier approached and asked.
“Oh, I’m worried Young Master Huo might suddenly reappear and summon us, and we wouldn’t have time to prepare.”
Chen Ping lied!
If they took off their armour, they’d likely be recognised immediately.
“Young Master Huo won’t show up anytime soon. Didn’t you see he’s already teleported home? This mansion is just his temporary rest stop, he won’t stay here.”
“Take off the armour, it’s so uncomfortable to keep it on…”
Unexpectedly, this guy was quite friendly and stepped forward to help Chen Ping remove his helmet and armour.
“Brother, I’ll keep it on. I’m too ugly, I’d scare you!”
Chen Ping hurriedly stopped him.
“How ugly could you be to scare me…”
As he spoke, the soldier pulled off Chen Ping’s helmet.
But the moment the helmet came off, a terrifying, grotesque face appeared, as if it had been ravaged by fire.
“Bloody hell…” The soldier jumped in fright, dropping the helmet to the ground.
“I told you it’d scare you, but you didn’t listen.”
Chen Ping quickly put the helmet back on.
“That’s too frightening, were you burned by fire?” The soldier gasped, still shaken!
But at that moment, a sharp, urgent sound suddenly rang out, and the soldier’s face changed instantly.
