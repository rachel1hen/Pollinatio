Chen Ping fell silent for a moment, understanding the implications of the Fourth Hall Master’s goodwill. With the support of the Fourth Hall, investigating the Evil Path Hall would be much smoother. However, he was also aware of the complex factions within the Temple. The Third Hall Master and the Sixth Hall Master would not let matters rest easily.
“I can agree to a reconciliation,” Chen Ping finally nodded, his gaze sharpening. “But if others in the Temple, like the Sixth Hall Master, continue to be aggressive, I, Chen Ping, will not sit idly by.”
“That is only natural,” Yun Xiu nodded in agreement. “The Fourth Hall Master has issued an order. If any Hall Master dares to trouble you privately, it will be considered an act against the Fourth Hall. Additionally, the Fourth Hall Master knows you are investigating the Evil Path Hall. The branch in the Black Wind Mountains is indeed troublesome. If you need intelligence or manpower, simply send a message to the Fourth Hall, and the Fourth Hall Master will surely assist.”
Chen Ping’s heart stirred. Although A Cui’s intelligence network was extensive, it could not compare to the Temple’s deep foundations. He clasped his hands and said, “In that case, I thank the Fourth Hall Master and Miss Yun Xiu.”
Yun Xiu smiled faintly. “Mr. Chen, take care to recover. I shall take my leave.” With that, her figure flickered, vanishing into the horizon like a wisp of green smoke.
Hu Mazi, watching the direction of Yun Xiu’s departure, clicked his tongue. “That maid is impressive, Earth Immortal Ninth Grade, isn’t she? Stronger than the Sixth Hall Master. Chen Ping, is this Fourth Hall Master reliable?”
Chen Ping gazed at Yun Xiu’s receding figure. “For now, at least, it benefits us.”
He turned to Nan Batian and A Cui, his eyes filled with apology. “I dragged you both into trouble today.”
Nan Batian waved it off, feeding A Cui the last pill. “What are you talking about, Mr. Chen? You’re our benefactor. Protecting you is only right. The Evil Path Hall’s branch is dangerous. Why don’t I go with you?”
A Cui nodded. “The Information Building has informants in the Black Wind Mountains. I can arrange for them to assist you.”
A wave of warmth surged in Chen Ping’s heart, but he shook his head. “You two have just reconciled. Rest and recover. I can handle the Evil Path Hall myself.”
“If Mr. Chen needs help, just say the word,” Nan Batian said.
Chen Ping nodded and left with Hu Mazi.
They did not head to the Evil Path Hall’s branch. With his current strength, Chen Ping knew that even if he found it, he would be unable to rescue the souls of the Hu Clan. He needed to increase his power, and quickly. The only way to do so efficiently was within the Demon-Suppressing Tower, where the flow of time would allow him to grow stronger in the shortest period. However, using the tower in an inn with only Hu Mazi as a guard made Chen Ping uneasy, especially with so many targeting him. A sneak attack during cultivation would be disastrous.
Thus, Chen Ping brought Hu Mazi to Mo Chen, the head disciple of the Sword Sect. Staying at Mo Chen’s residence was a natural choice. Chen Ping’s days of recovery there were calm yet fulfilling.
Mo Chen’s residence lay deep within a bamboo forest on the western side of Sword Saint City. The courtyard housed a simple sword hut, perpetually filled with the scent of swords. Before the hut, hundreds of rusted ancient swords were embedded in the soil, forming a unique sword forest. It was said these were broken swords Mo Chen had collected from battlefield ruins or fallen sects during his travels. He once said, “A sword may break, but its intent endures. Observing broken swords is like observing the sword intent of predecessors, allowing one to comprehend their own path.”
Each morning, Chen Ping would meditate and heal in the sword forest. The pills Yun Xiu left were remarkably effective; the claw wounds on his back scabbed over in three days, and the cold, sinister energy invading his body gradually dissipated under the warmth of a “Warm Jade Talisman” gifted by Mo Chen.
Even more surprising, under the nourishing sword essence of the forest, his spiritual energy flowed more harmoniously. The bottleneck at the peak of the Seventh Grade of the Loose Immortal Realm showed faint signs of loosening.
