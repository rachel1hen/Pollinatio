The cultivators of Cangxuan Continent struggled in agony within the poisonous mist, their defensive treasures shattering one after another, screams echoing endlessly.
The King of Chelie Kingdom’s soft sword was cleaved by a bone blade, a deep, bone-revealing gash appearing on his chest.
Aisha’s long spear, riddled with corrosion, gave way as she stumbled and fell, narrowly avoiding being crushed into pulp by a bone puppet.
Lan Lianhua’s azure lotus array collapsed entirely; she spat out a mouthful of blood and, as the black mist swept her away, threw a jade talisman toward Chen Ping with all her might.
The moment Chen Ping caught the jade talisman, a flood of information poured into his mind.
It was an ancient sword technique from Lan Lianhua’s sect, requiring one’s lifeblood as a catalyst to compress all spiritual energy into a three-inch sword beam, capable of cutting through any demonic barrier.
But the cost of wielding this sword was dire—it would drain the caster’s vitality, leaving them a husk even if successful.
“No choice!”
Chen Ping bit his tongue, spraying a mouthful of lifeblood onto the Dragon-Slaying Sword.
The sword let out a dragon-like hum, its three-foot blade extending endlessly until it became a thousand-zhang light blade, its sword aura slicing black fissures into space itself.
Just as the Demon Bone Devouring Heaven Array neared completion, Chen Ping leaped forward, the light blade carrying world-destroying momentum as it struck the array’s core.
The Bone-Eroding King’s laughter stopped abruptly. He hurriedly summoned demonic energy to resist, but the moment it met the sword beam, his entire body began to crumble inch by inch.
The twelve bone puppets exploded into clouds of bone dust, but the Bone-Eroding King, a half-step Great Vehicle demon, though gravely wounded, still had strength to retaliate.
His remaining arm suddenly extended, transforming into a massive black claw aimed straight at Chen Ping’s heart.
At the critical moment, the Dragon-Slaying Sword erupted in seven-coloured radiance.
Chen Ping let out a majestic roar: “A mere demon dares to act so brazenly!”
A golden dragon shadow flew from the sword, colliding with the black claw in a deafening clash.
The violent energy wave levelled everything within a hundred li, leaving a massive crater in the ground.
When the dust settled, the Bone-Eroding King’s figure was gone, leaving only a black token etched with eerie runes.
“We’ve won!”
The surviving cultivators cheered, but their celebration was soon interrupted by a new crisis.
The true army of Bone-Eroding City finally appeared, a dense swarm of demonic soldiers flooding the sky like a black tide.
Worse still, the skeleton soldiers previously reduced to ash by the fire qilin began to reform in the black mist, their numbers now several times greater!
“How can this be?”
Mo Qingyun’s face paled, her spiritual energy nearly depleted.
Chen Ping, leaning on his Dragon-Slaying Sword to stand, had his meridians shattered from using the ancient sword technique, barely able to stay upright.
The little fire qilin, drained from overuse, had its flames dimming.
The relentless toll left Chen Ping and his group struggling to hold on.
In this moment of despair, the sky suddenly darkened.
A darkness deeper than the black mist enveloped the battlefield, stilling even the howling demonic winds.
“That’s…” Hu Mazi’s eyes widened, pointing at the sky.
Above the clouds, a black shadow slowly emerged.
“The Heaven-Devouring Beast!” Chen Ping exclaimed with joy.
He had no idea when this lazy, ever-sleeping little Heaven-Devouring Beast had slipped out.
With the Heaven-Devouring Beast joining the fray, Chen Ping felt reassured, knowing it could devour anything.
“Swallow them all, devour every one of these demons!” Chen Ping commanded the little Heaven-Devouring Beast.
But to his surprise, the beast merely glanced at him, showing no sign of action.
“Kid, this Heaven-Devouring Beast is my mount, not yours. You think it’ll listen to you?”
“And show some respect—it’s not your dog to order around.”
The Red Cloud Demon Lord’s voice echoed in Chen Ping’s mind, expressing dissatisfaction with his attitude.
