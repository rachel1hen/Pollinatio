“What’s the situation?”Ding Daorong also walked out of the room!
“General Xing, it should be that Mr. Chen is about to break through to the Mahayana Realm!”
Bai Cheng said as he glanced at the room where Chen Ping was practicing!
“It’s just a breakthrough to the Mahayana Realm, how could there be such a commotion?”Criminal Dao Rong was puzzled!
After all, there were quite a few cultivators of the Mahayana Realm in Beast City, and there were often cultivators who broke through to the Mahayana Realm, but no one had made such a commotion when breaking through to the Mahayana Realm ah!
“General Xing, don’t forget that Mr. Chen is a Dragon Race, a true Dragon Race cultivator!”
Bai Cheng reminded Interdiction Daorong.
Criminal Daorong was not speaking, but was staring dead on at the thunderbolt cloud in the sky!
The sky was as if it was drenched in ink, dark clouds were converging from all directions towards the mountain peak where he was, and each dark cloud seemed to be carrying the weight of a thousand pounds, pressurizing the air so much that it became heavy and oppressive.
In the dark clouds, lightning flashed and thunder roared, and a silver lightning bolt shuttled like a swimming dragon, signaling the imminent arrival of an unprecedented thunderbolt.
Chen Ping knew that the most crucial moment had come, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes, the spiritual energy in his body was like a river rushing, converging at the place of his dantian to form a majestic force.
He felt the fluctuations of the aura between the sky and the earth, resonating with the sky and the earth, as if in this moment, he was one with the entire world.
With the first streak of lightning breaking through the sky, the Thunder Tribulation officially opened.
It was a thick, silver-colored thunder tribulation that carried a whistling sound that tore through the air, striking directly at the top of Chen Ping’s head.
Chen Ping clenched his teeth and hardened his physical body to carry down that thunder tribulation.
However, this was only the beginning of the thunder tribulation, immediately afterward, more thunder tribulations came at him like a raging storm, each one carrying the power to destroy the sky and the earth.
Chen Ping’s figure loomed in the midst of the thunderbolts, and each lightning strike caused him to feel an unprecedented sharp pain, as if there were millions of sharp blades cutting into his flesh.
However, Chen Ping did not retreat, he gritted his teeth and persisted, using his willpower to support his body, fighting to the death with the thunderbolt.
During this process, Chen Ping’s fleshly body experienced an unprecedented test.
The power of the lightning tribulation left scorched black marks on his skin, and there were even places that were bloodied and blurred.
However, the spiritual energy within his body was constantly repairing these wounds, with each repair giving his fleshly body a qualitative leap in strength.
More importantly, Chen Ping’s spiritual energy had also been sublimated under the baptism of the thunderbolt.
He felt the will of heaven and earth contained in the lightning, it was a primitive and pure power, as if it was the deepest call of nature.
He tried to understand this power, to feel the mysteries within it, to let his mind resonate with the heavens and the earth, so as to reach a transcendent realm.
As time passed, the thunderbolt gradually entered the high .Tide.
Lightning bolts as thick as giant dragons descended from the sky, and each strike was enough to destroy a small mountain.
Chen Ping’s entire body was seething with spiritual energy, as if he had become one with the lightning in heaven and earth.
He was no longer just passively defending, but actively striking out, using the power of lightning to fight against the lightning tribulation, displaying astonishing control and combat prowess.
Finally, after a deafening roar, the last of the lightning dissipated in the sky, and the thunder tribulation clouds dispersed, revealing a long-lost clear sky.
The house that Chen Ping was in had long since gone up in smoke, while he stood in the same spot, his clothes ragged and his hair disheveled, but his eyes were brighter and deeper, as if he had gained insight into the mysteries of heaven and earth.
At this moment, his heart was filled with awe and realization of power, life, and heaven and earth, and he knew that this was just a new beginning, and that there was still a long, long road ahead.
“Boom!”
Accompanied by a deafening roar, the aura around Chen Ping expanded violently, as if it was going to burst through the entire heaven and earth.
