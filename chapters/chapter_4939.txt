“Of course, the money goes to the city lord. The entire Purgatory Field is controlled by the city lord’s mansion,” Bai Yi explained to Chen Ping.
“At the back mountain of Rhino City, there’s a cave called the Demon Cave. Legend has it that in ancient times, a large number of demons were sealed inside.”
“Later, Rhino City was built here, and the Demon Cave came under the city lord’s mansion’s control.”
“The array for entering the Demon Cave is also managed by the city lord’s mansion. Over time, the Demon Cave became the Purgatory Field.”
“Someone once trained in the Purgatory Field for a year. When they emerged, their strength had soared, and they ascended directly to the Second Heaven.”
“Demon Cave?” Chen Ping’s heart leapt with excitement. “Father-in-law, can you take me to see it?”
“Is your strength up to it? Those who enter the Demon Cave are all rogue cultivators, and many never make it out.”
“With your current strength, it might be dangerous to attempt the trial,” Bai Yi said, worried for Chen Ping’s safety.
“Don’t worry, Father-in-law, I know my limits. The only question is whether you can come up with the five hundred thousand immortal coins,” Chen Ping said, concerned about the entry fee.
“Since you’ve made up your mind, I’ll scrape together the five hundred thousand immortal coins even if I have to sell everything I own.”
“Just focus on your safety. Don’t be reckless once you’re inside. If anything feels off, come out immediately,” Bai Yi said, fearing for Chen Ping’s safety and how he’d explain any mishap to his daughter.
“I understand!” Chen Ping nodded firmly.
“Alright, since you’re set on it, follow me!” Bai Yi led Chen Ping out of the Spirit Fox Gang.
Before leaving, Chen Ping checked in with Xiu Rui and Hu Mazi, who were both thriving at the Spirit Fox Gang.
Hu Mazi, in particular, was living it up, keeping the two women he’d brought thoroughly exhausted with his nightly antics.
Leaving the Spirit Fox Gang, Bai Yi took Chen Ping and flew towards the northern part of Rhino City.
Rhino City was vast, and in its northern reaches stood a towering mountain, ten thousand metres high.
They flew for over an hour before slowly descending.
Now at the mountain’s base, Chen Ping felt an oppressive weight from the massive peak looming before them.
Halfway up the mountain was a cave, a hundred metres wide, surrounded by flickering golden light.
A winding staircase led directly to the cave.
At the foot of the mountain, a courtyard was enveloped by an array, and the staircase began within that courtyard.
“What are you here for?” two armoured battle soldiers approached, questioning Bai Yi and Chen Ping.
“We’re here for the trial, to enter the Purgatory Field,” Bai Yi replied.
The soldiers gave them a quick glance, then stepped aside. “Go in…”
Bai Yi led Chen Ping into the courtyard and approached the payment counter.
“Five hundred thousand immortal coins per person,” a middle-aged woman said without looking up.
Bai Yi tossed her a storage pouch. The woman weighed it in her hand and casually tucked it away.
“That’s for one person. Which of you is going?” she asked, finally looking up at Bai Yi and Chen Ping.
“He’s going,” Bai Yi said, pointing to Chen Ping.
The woman scrutinized Chen Ping, her eyes flashing with surprise.
“Entering the Purgatory Field is at your own risk. We take no responsibility for life or death,” she warned.
“Don’t worry, if I die, I won’t come looking for you,” Chen Ping said with a faint smile.
The woman handed him a pale purple crystal. “This is the trial crystal for entering the Purgatory Field. Follow the stairs up from here. There are one hundred and eighty thousand steps, and you must climb them all.”
“If you can’t even make it up the one hundred and eighty thousand steps, you’re not qualified to enter the Purgatory Field, and the five hundred thousand immortal coins won’t be refunded.”
