The two hid in the dense forest, patiently waiting for an opportunity.
Soon, a female snake demon in a green dress approached alone, carrying a basket, seemingly out to gather herbs.
Her strength was at the early stage of first-grade Earth Immortal, and she showed little caution towards her surroundings.
“She’s the one.”
Chen Ping exchanged a glance with Hu Mazi, and they acted together.
In a flash, Chen Ping appeared behind the snake demon, striking her neck with a hand chop.
Caught off guard, the snake demon let out a muffled groan and fainted.
Hu Mazi quickly dragged her to a secluded corner in the forest depths.
“Wake up,” Hu Mazi said, patting her cheek.
The snake demon slowly opened her eyes. Seeing Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, a flicker of fear passed through her gaze. She tried to scream, but Hu Mazi covered her mouth.
“Quiet, or I’ll rape and kill you!”
Hu Mazi growled, loosening his belt as if to remove his trousers in a threatening gesture.
Terrified by Hu Mazi’s actions, the snake demon nodded repeatedly.
Chen Ping shot Hu Mazi a look. This guy, he thought, still resorting to these tactics to intimidate women.
Hu Mazi released her but kept a wary eye. “I’ll ask you some questions. Answer honestly, and I’ll let you go.”
“Otherwise, I’ll make you scream with my ‘treasure’!”
“Who… who are you? What do you want?” the snake demon asked, her voice trembling.
“Who we are doesn’t matter,” Chen Ping said. “Tell me, was the Green Snake Valley Lord killed by Black Wind Stronghold?”
The snake demon hesitated, then nodded. “Yes… yes. The Valley Lord… he died horribly.”
“What does the Crimson Training Sect plan to do?” Chen Ping asked.
“The Sect Leader has gathered the sect’s experts to seek revenge on Black Wind Stronghold,” the snake demon said. “Our Crimson Training Sect and Green Snake Valley are both of the snake demon lineage. We won’t stand by after the Valley Lord’s death.”
“Are there other factions willing to help you?” Chen Ping asked, this being his main concern.
The snake demon shook her head. “No. Other factions are either allied with Black Wind Stronghold or afraid of getting involved. None are willing to intervene.”
Chen Ping frowned. This wasn’t what he expected.
Could it be that only Black Demon Palace and Black Wind Stronghold were involved in the clan extermination?
“Do you know about the Hu clan’s extermination two thousand eight hundred years ago?” Hu Mazi couldn’t help but ask.
The snake demon paused, then shook her head. “I don’t know anything about the Hu clan. I haven’t been in the sect long and don’t know much about old matters.”
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi exchanged a glance, disappointment flashing in their eyes.
It seemed they wouldn’t get much useful information from her.
“One last question,” Chen Ping said. “Where is the Crimson Training Sect Leader now?”
“The Sect Leader is in seclusion, preparing to break through to third-grade Earth Immortal. He should emerge in a few days,” the snake demon replied.
Chen Ping nodded and turned to Hu Mazi. “Let’s go.”
Hu Mazi hesitated. “Just let her go like that?”
Looking at the woman’s figure, Hu Mazi, who hadn’t been with a woman in a long time since leaving his women in the Third Heaven, hadn’t sought one in the Fourth Heaven.
“What, you have other ideas?” Chen Ping asked.
“How about I have a quick go?” Hu Mazi suggested.
“Let her go,” Chen Ping said. “Killing her would only alert the enemy and hinder our information gathering.”
“A gentle one, then?” Hu Mazi persisted.
“Let her go, or I won’t bother with you!”
Chen Ping made as if to leave.
Hu Mazi reluctantly nodded, knocked the snake demon unconscious, and left with Chen Ping.
