“Family master, treasures, treasures have appeared ……”
A smattering of Ning family disciples roared in excitement!
Ning Caichen looked over and realised that on top of a huge boulder, there was golden light spreading around!
There was a formation that surrounded the boulder, and at the very top of the boulder, there was a gongfa!
On top of that gong method, there was a faint mist floating around, and at a glance, it was not a mortal product!
“Quickly go, inform the Old Ancestor that a treasure has been found ……”
Ning Caichen also ordered excitedly!
That Ning family’s son happily ran off to report the discovery, and Ning Zhi soon ran over impatiently!
Looking at the huge boulder in front of him, and the gongfu placed on top of it, Ning Zhi’s heart couldn’t be more excited!
Ning Zhi wanted to go forward and break the formation to get the merit technique, but he was stopped by Ning Caichen!
“Old Ancestor, just let us do this kind of work, you can rest on the sidelines!”
Ning Caichen said as he stepped forward to stop Ning Zhi!
He was afraid that something might happen to Ning Zhi, knowing that in the future, the Ning family’s soaring success would all depend on Ning Zhi!
Ning Caichen sent out two of his disciples to slowly approach the surrounding formation!
The two Ning Clan disciples were all cautious!
Soon, the two Ning Clan disciples arrived in front of the formation, and one of them slowly stretched out his hand, not realising that his palm would directly penetrate the formation!
The two people were stunned, and then they all stepped in, and the formation didn’t work at all!
Just when the two people were excitedly trying to get their hands on that technique!
Only to see a flash of light from the formation, followed by a black hole appearing instantly in the rock wall behind the boulder!
Roar …………
A hissing roar emanated from that black hole, and the violent aura instantly blew those two Ning Clan children away!
Then a beast of enormous size, with two eyes like lanterns, slowly walked out from within that black hole that had suddenly appeared!
The beast was seen to have a huge lion’s head, but its body was patterned!
“A lion and tiger beast? Isn’t this kind of demonic beast already extinct?”
Seeing the Lion-Tiger Beast that appeared, Ning Caichen said with a surprised look on his face!
Just as Ning Caichen’s words fell, he only saw a black gas spewing out from the mouth of that Lion-Tiger Beast, which carried with it a kind of soul-stirring power!
Everyone in the Ning Clan was sent flying out by this sudden jet of black gas, and there were even a few Ning Clan disciples who died on the spot from bleeding from their seven orifices!
Blood was also spilling from the corners of Ning Caixin’s mouth, and he was also injured!
Ning Zhi, on the other hand, had a cold face, as if the ones who died weren’t even from their Ning family.
“Old ancestor, this …… this lion and tiger beast ……”
Ning Caichen looked at Ning Zhi in shock, while at the moment, Ning Zhi was acting calmly!
Ning Zhi stared tightly at the Lion-Tiger Beast, it was the first time he had seen this kind of demonic beast!
Only to see that the Lion-Tiger Beast’s body was unexpectedly covered in black scales, and on top of the scales was a pattern!
This look of a lion not being a lion and a tiger not being a tiger was indeed quite bluffing as well!
The Lion-Tiger Beast’s eyes lifted up, looking at Ning Zhi in front of him as he stared at himself in death, so he roared once more, and the black mist in his mouth became even thicker!
And this time, the mist carried with it an extreme coldness!
Even with the Ning family all prepared, this mouthful of black mist caused half of the Ning family to be infested with black mist, and some of them were even directly frozen!
Ning Zhi’s pupils shrank, he didn’t think that this Lion-Tiger Beast would be able to use a freezing spell in this underground crevice!”
One must know that in this rift, where the temperature was extremely high, it wasn’t easy to cast a freezing spell!
The fact that this Lion and Tiger Beast was able to achieve a freezing effect with a casual spray was also enough to see how powerful the Lion and Tiger Beast was!
“Run……”
Only at this moment did Ning Zhi remember to shout for the crowd to leave!
As Ning Zhi told the people to run away, he waved his hands and formed a huge barrier in front of him!
