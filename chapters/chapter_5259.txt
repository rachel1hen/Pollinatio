“This, how is this possible?”
“Seventh-grade Loose Immortal Realm, withstanding ten moves against a seventh-grade Earth Immortal Realm without defeat? This lad’s a monster!”
“Too terrifying, with such resilience and combat strength, his future prospects are limitless!”
The surrounding discussions grew louder, and the gazes directed at Chen Ping were filled with shock and admiration.
The eleventh move!
Fat Lady’s giant palm finally broke through Chen Ping’s defence, slamming heavily into his chest.
“Pfft!”
Chen Ping, as if struck by a heavy blow, spewed a mouthful of blood, his body flying backwards like a kite with a broken string, crashing hard against the wall and sliding down, his life or death unknown.
“Brother Chen!” Hu Mazi’s eyes bulged with rage as he let out a sorrowful cry, struggling desperately to rush over but was firmly held back by the guards.
Fat Lady, panting heavily, looked at Chen Ping lying on the ground, a complex glint flashing in her eyes.
She hadn’t expected it would take so much effort to take down a seventh-grade Loose Immortal, and she’d even been injured by him, which made her expression even uglier. She stepped towards Chen Ping, clearly intent on finishing him off.
At that moment, a commanding voice came from outside the Information Building: “Stop!”
The crowd turned to look and saw a group of cultivators in Sword Sect attire striding in quickly, led by none other than Mo Chen.
Ling Xue followed by his side, her face turning pale the moment she saw Chen Ping on the ground.
Mo Chen’s gaze swept over the scene, taking in the injured Fat Lady, Chen Ping lying on the ground with his fate uncertain, and the surrounding chaos, his eyes instantly turning cold.
“Fat Lady Building Master, what a display of power!”
Mo Chen’s voice was calm but carried an undeniable pressure, “My Sword Sect disciple, treated this way in your Information Building?”
Fat Lady’s expression shifted slightly upon seeing Mo Chen.
She had naturally heard of Mo Chen’s reputation, one of the top experts of the Sword Sect, with unfathomable strength. Though both were in the Earth Immortal Realm, she wasn’t entirely confident she could defeat him.
However, holding the upper hand at this moment, she naturally wouldn’t show weakness.
“Friend Mo Chen, your disciple committed murder in my Information Building. Is there anything wrong with me teaching him a lesson?” Fat Lady said coldly.
“Committed murder?”
Mo Chen let out a cold snort, “There must be a reason behind it. Though my disciple is young, he’s not one to kill indiscriminately. How about we let this matter rest? My Sword Sect is willing to compensate for your Information Building’s losses, ten thousand immortal stones, how’s that?”
He didn’t want to escalate the situation, as this was the Information Building, not Sword Sect territory.
Fat Lady sneered at his words, “Friend Mo Chen, are you treating me like a beggar? The losses to my Information Building go beyond a mere servant girl, there’s also the reputation of my establishment! Ten thousand immortal stones? Not enough!”
“How much does the Building Master want, then?” Mo Chen asked, restraining his patience.
“One million immortal stones!” Fat Lady demanded outrageously, “Plus, have this lad kowtow and apologise to me, and I might consider sparing his life!”
“You’re going too far!” Ling Xue couldn’t hold back her anger.
Chen Ping had already been beaten so badly, yet Fat Lady was still making such excessive demands.
Mo Chen’s face darkened as well, “Is the Building Master determined to make an enemy of my Sword Sect?”
“An enemy? So what?”
Fat Lady was fearless, “Friend Mo Chen, don’t think your Sword Sect’s reputation scares my Information Building.
Today, either do as I say, or don’t blame me for being unkind!”
“Fine, very well!” Mo Chen nodded, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes, “Since the Building Master refuses to give me this courtesy, I’ll have to test your skills myself!”
Before his words faded, Mo Chen moved. His figure blurred, an aura even stronger than Fat Lady’s spreading out. A simple, ancient long sword appeared in his hand, and with a flash of sword light, it thrust towards Fat Lady with a fierce momentum.
