“Using the same trick twice, the Saintess underestimates me too much,” Hu Mazi’s voice came from behind.
The Saintess spun around sharply, seeing Hu Mazi standing three steps behind her, holding the porcelain bottle.
“This is the real antidote,” Hu Mazi shook the bottle, “Want it?”
The Saintess could barely stand, the backlash from the Blood Soul Thread causing her excruciating pain.
Finally, she collapsed, kneeling on the ground, “Please… please give me the antidote… I’ll agree to anything…”
Hu Mazi sighed, “If you’d known it would come to this, why bother?”
Hu Mazi’s fingertips traced the cool patterns on the porcelain bottle, the Saintess’s half-naked body shimmering with an enticing glow.
The blood jade hairpin dangling in her hair swayed gently, her eyes brimming with seductive charm.
The Saintess of the Blood Shadow Palace, who moments ago was brimming with killing intent, now curled up on the ground like a red butterfly with broken wings, her slender fingers trembling as they reached for Hu Mazi’s hem, “Master… give me the antidote… I’ll bring all my disciples to serve you…”
Hu Mazi’s throat bobbed, his mind flashing with memories of the pleasure quarters in the Sixth Heaven, his gaze catching the lingering flush on the Saintess’s neck, a mark of the Love Flower Tribulation’s aroused desire.
He knew this woman had a venomous heart, yet he couldn’t resist the primal temptation.
“Fine, fine,” he sighed deeply, tossing the porcelain bottle over, “If you’d known, why play mind games with me?”
The moment the Saintess caught the antidote, a cold glint flashed in her eyes.
Instead of taking it, she suddenly turned the bottle’s mouth towards Hu Mazi, her fingertips shooting out several blood threads to seal his body’s acupoints.
“Old lecher, did you really think I’d submit?” she laughed sharply, her palm erupting with blood-red light, “The women of the Blood Shadow Palace only die standing, never live kneeling!”
By the time Hu Mazi realised something was wrong, it was too late, a blood-red claw pierced his chest.
He looked at the Saintess in disbelief, blood surging from his mouth, “You…”
“Master Hu!” Chen Ping shot forward like lightning, his palm blazing with golden light aimed at the Saintess’s back.
The Saintess was prepared, her body erupting with blood shadows that turned into thousands of blood arrows shooting towards Chen Ping, while she shouted, “Blood Shadow Palace disciples, activate the ‘Ten Thousand Charms Soul-Bewitching Formation’!”
Before her voice faded, hundreds of female cultivators, previously affected by the Thousand Illusions Soul-Bewitching Incense, suddenly tore off their remaining clothes, rushing naked towards Yun Wuya and the Qingyun Sect disciples.
Their eyes glowed with an eerie peach-blossom hue, their mouths chanting lascivious melodies, the fragrance they emitted even more beguiling than Hu Mazi’s soul-bewitching incense.
“Sect Leader Yun, save us…” one female cultivator knelt before Yun Wuya, her jade arms wrapping around his waist, “If you protect us, this servant is willing to do anything…”
Yun Wuya’s face darkened, circulating his energy to push back the approaching female cultivator, roaring, “Demonic arts bewitching people! Cease this insolence!”
Though he could guard his mind, the Qingyun Sect disciples behind him were already ensnared.
The young cultivators’ eyes were dazed, some even stepping forward to shield the female cultivators, drawing their swords at Chen Ping, “Don’t harm them!”
“They’re innocent…” one disciple trembled, yet staunchly protected the female cultivator behind him, “If you want to kill them, kill me first!”
Chen Ping looked at the disciples controlled by the charm technique, the golden light in his eyes intensifying.
He knew the Blood Shadow Palace’s charm arts not only affected the senses but could also twist the mind.
“Foolish!” he growled, his palm’s golden light forming a ring that rippled outwards like waves.
“Buzz…”
The invisible sound wave shattered the lascivious melodies in the air, the peach-blossom glow on the female cultivators instantly fading.
The Qingyun Sect disciples snapped awake, staring at the naked female cultivators they were protecting, retreating in shock, their faces filled with shame and fear.
” Courting death!”
Chen Ping showed no more mercy, instantly summoning the Dragon-Slaying Sword, its golden sword qi condensing like a gale sweeping through leaves, slashing towards the Blood Shadow Palace female cultivators.
