Mo Qingyun’s face flushed again at his words, and she hid behind Huo Jingjing.
Huo Jingjing scolded, “Master Hu! Don’t talk nonsense!”
Chen Ping laughed heartily, slinging his arms around their shoulders, “Curious? Why not find a girl and try it yourself?”
Hu Mazi stroked his chin, a look of longing on his face, “That’s not a bad idea…”
Seeing the three of them chatting and laughing, the Seventh Hall Master, standing at a distance, remarked with some puzzlement, “Such a pity. Chen Ping’s strength is impressive, but in dual cultivation, he’s still lacking. To think he only lasted an hour!”
Chen Ping was rendered speechless upon hearing this.
Hu Mazi burst into laughter, “Seventh Hall Master, you don’t understand. The time flow in the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda is different, a year outside is a hundred years inside. It may have been just an hour out here, but Chen Ping was at it for days in there.”
“If I’m not mistaken, those two girls are probably swollen…”
“What? That impressive?” The Seventh Hall Master was utterly shocked.
Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun both lowered their heads, blushing. Only they knew whether they were swollen or not!
…
The mysterious land of the Third Heaven!
This place was shrouded in perpetual darkness, with thick black mist so dense it blocked out all sunlight.
Deep within, a palace built from countless withered bones floated in midair. The plaque above the entrance bore the words “Evil Path Hall,” written in congealed blood, emitting a nauseating stench.
On the main seat, a figure cloaked in black robes sat silently.
Nine grey-black soul banners orbited around him, their surfaces writhing with countless tormented faces screaming in agony. Each sway of the banners caused the palace’s temperature to drop sharply.
This was You Wuxie, the Grand Elder of the Evil Path Hall.
The soul lamps of the Nether Twins had gone out, and even the Yin Division Shadow Guards had been completely wiped out!
This was a massive blow to You Wuxie.
As the Grand Elder and the overseer of this branch of the Evil Path Hall, he had no way to explain this to the organisation.
Most critically, they had lost the token, the most precious treasure of the Evil Path Hall!
With enough souls absorbed by a few tokens, they could unlock the coordinates to the Tianlin Cave Mansion, leading them to the legendary Tianling Cave Mansion!
To gather enough souls, the Evil Path Hall had sent him to lead the Nether Twins, Ghost Face, and others to the Third Heaven, where they carved out a space to harvest souls.
But who could have imagined the token would be lost, and Ghost Face and the Nether Twins would be killed? If this news reached the higher-ups of the Evil Path Hall, even a hundred lives wouldn’t be enough for him to atone!
“Useless! All useless!”
A furious roar thundered through the hall, instantly covering the stone pillars with web-like cracks.
Twelve Shadow Guards knelt on one knee, heads pressed to the ground, trembling like leaves, not daring to breathe.
On the white jade table before You Wuxie lay two dim, lifeless soul pearls, the natal soul pearls of the Nether Twins, now completely shattered, with only a faint trace of spiritual energy lingering.
“The Nether Twins followed me for three hundred years, their cultivation at the peak of the Loose Immortal Realm. They could hold their own even against an Earth Immortal for a moment, yet they were killed by some brat from the Third Heaven?”
You Wuxie’s voice was like nails on glass, sharp and grating, “Investigate! Find out everything about this Chen Ping!”
A hunched old man stepped forward shakily, “Reporting to the Grand Elder, I’ve uncovered that this person is named Chen Ping. He appeared suddenly in the Qingyun Sect’s territory a few days ago, his cultivation progressing at an astonishing rate. He once killed a fifth-grade Loose Immortal Realm cultivator while only at the third grade.”
“As for killing the Nether Twins, according to the message they sent before their deaths… it seems Chen Ping was possessed by an extremely powerful divine soul.”
