At this moment on the high platform, two people were already battered and bruised, their faces swollen and noses bleeding, yet neither had used any techniques or aura!
On this arena, using other methods would lead to scorn.
Even if bloodied and broken, no techniques could be used to heal, nor could one attack the opponent.
It all came down to strength, endurance, and the toughness of the physical body.
“This is actually a good way to make money…”
Chen Ping watched the two fighting on the platform and suddenly had an idea.
Chen Ping’s strength might not match these people, nor was his realm as high, but if it came to the toughness of the physical body, none of them could compare.
“What are you joking about, a good way to make money? This could cost you your life.”
“This hundred-metre-high platform, if you fall from it without using any techniques or aura, could you withstand it?”
The middle-aged man saw that Chen Ping actually wanted to earn money by fighting in the arena and spoke up.
“What? You’re not allowed to use any techniques or aura when coming down from the platform either?”
Chen Ping was speechless. To jump from a hundred-metre-high platform with just flesh and blood, wasn’t that madness?
No matter how tough the body, jumping from a hundred-metre platform would likely turn one into a pile of mush.
“There’s a restrictive formation on the platform, making it impossible to use techniques or aura. Only after a victor is decided and the formation is lifted can one come down easily.”
“But many people, before the match ends, get knocked off the platform and fall, turning into mush.”
“For just a few immortal coins, you’d lose your life. Do you still think it’s easy money?”
The middle-aged man asked.
“These rules are acceptable, I can deal with that.” Chen Ping nodded.
“Friend Chen, are you thinking of giving it a go?”
Xiu Rui asked.
“Of course, with something this fun, I’ve got to try it.”
Chen Ping nodded.
“Young man, I’d advise you not to try. Look at your build, you probably couldn’t take two punches up there.”
“This is just the first match, there are nine more to go. Even if you win, you’d have to keep facing the next challenger.”
“You wouldn’t last. If you want to try, pick the right moment, when the person on the platform has fought two matches and is exhausted, then go up.”
“These things require brains, brute strength alone won’t win.”
The middle-aged man offered Chen Ping advice.
“Hasn’t anyone ever stood on the platform until the very end?”
Chen Ping asked curiously.
“Of course, but nowadays it’s often secretly rigged. By this method, someone fights all ten matches and gets to enter the City Lord’s Mansion.”
“People know what’s going on, so they just come to watch the spectacle.”
“As far as I know, in thousands of years, only three people have stood on the platform until the end without cheating.”
“You must understand, without techniques or aura, it’s all about physical strength, nothing to do with realm.”
The middle-aged man said.
Chen Ping found it amusing. So, the heavenly realm had these tricks too, just like the secular world with their rigged tenders and fake bidders!
The winner was predetermined, so what was the point of such a match?
“If that’s the case, this competition is utterly pointless.” Xiu Rui couldn’t help but scoff.
“What do you know? This is how the world works. See those two on the platform? They’re battered and bruised, but it’s all fake.”
“That man in the ornate robe, he’s Long Qi, the young master of the Long family in Rhino City, so he’s guaranteed to win this time.”
“It’s all arranged, the people going up are preselected, everyone knows, and no one else will step up.”
“You’ve got to give the Long family face, or you won’t survive in Rhino City.”
The middle-aged man explained tirelessly to Chen Ping and the others, probably to show off his knowledge.
