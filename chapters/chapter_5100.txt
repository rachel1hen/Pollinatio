The old man in black fled for a long time before daring to stop, seeing that Chen Ping hadn’t pursued him, he let out a long sigh of relief.
“Damn it, what a bloody monster, only at the fourth rank of Loose Immortal Realm, yet he made me, an eighth-rank Loose Immortal, look so pathetic!”
The old man in black cursed.
What he didn’t know was that Chen Ping was merely using him for practice. If Chen Ping had struck with full force, the old man’s head would have long been on the ground, with no chance of escape.
“Whoever spread that news is a real bastard, clearly setting others up for trouble!”
The old man in black had been duped.
Seeing that Chen Ping was only at the fourth rank of Loose Immortal Realm, he hadn’t taken him seriously at all.
But now, reflecting on it, he finally understood. For Chen Ping to have obtained a treasure from an ancient ruin, it proved his strength or background was far from ordinary. Otherwise, a mere fourth-rank Loose Immortal could never have claimed such a treasure.
Realising he’d been tricked, the old man in black left in frustration.
Though filled with reluctance, he knew this was a conspiracy. To avoid being ensnared, he had to stay far away.
…
Chen Ping held the old man’s storage pouch but didn’t keep it, instead handing it directly to Mo Wuji.
“Patriarch Mo, consider the resources in this storage pouch as capital for rebuilding the Mo family,” Chen Ping said.
The Mo family’s estate had suffered significant destruction in this battle.
“Chen Ping, why stand on ceremony with me? We’re family!” Mo Wuji didn’t reach for it.
Chen Ping stuffed it into Mo Wuji’s hands, saying, “Now, almost everyone in the Triple Heaven knows I possess a treasure from an ancient ruin. There’ll surely be many targeting me.”
“I can’t stay with the Mo family any longer, or it’ll bring disaster upon you.”
“I plan to take Qingyun and leave for now. Once this matter is settled, I’ll let Qingyun come back to see you.”
“Alright, be careful. Given the Mo family’s current state, it’s indeed not suitable to stay here,” Mo Wuji nodded.
“Father…”
Mo Qingyun looked at Mo Wuji, her eyes full of reluctance.
“Once I rebuild the Mo family in a while, come back to see me.”
Mo Wuji gently patted Mo Qingyun’s shoulder.
Mo Qingyun nodded firmly.
Chen Ping left with Mo Qingyun, and soon their figures vanished into the horizon.
But soon after, as Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun travelled through the void, the space around them began to tremble violently. A beam of light enveloped them.
Instinctively, Chen Ping shielded Mo Qingyun behind him as figures appeared around them, staring in their direction.
“Is this the Chen Ping who possesses the ancient ruin’s treasure?”
Someone voiced their doubt.
Chen Ping frowned upon hearing this. How was it that no matter where he went, people recognised him?
He was clearly being targeted.
“Sorry, I’m not Chen Ping!” Chen Ping shook his head.
“Stop talking nonsense, we’ve all seen your projection!”
Someone waved a hand, and a projection appeared in the void, clearly showing Chen Ping.
Now, Chen Ping couldn’t deny it even if he wanted to.
They’d even prepared a projection, determined to ensure Chen Ping had no place to stand in the Triple Heaven.
“This guy, only at the fourth rank of Loose Immortal Realm, how could he have obtained an ancient ruin’s treasure?”
Someone raised a question.
A few others began to close in on Chen Ping, all curious about the ancient ruin’s treasure.
Seeing them approach, Chen Ping said coldly, “I don’t care who you are, but you’d better not provoke me. Those who do will meet a bad end.”
“Bloody hell, you’re that arrogant, are you?” a man in green sneered. “A mere fourth-rank Loose Immortal dares to talk to us like that?”
“I’m—”
Pfft…
Before the man in green could finish, Chen Ping struck. His Dragon-Slaying Sword instantly severed the man’s head.
