“A million immortal stones?” The Bone-Eroding King was instantly stunned. After a long pause, he nodded repeatedly, saying, “Good, good, good, I’ll contact someone right away and make sure to wipe out that Cangxuan Continent.”
“Master Huo, please rest here for now, let me go find someone…”
“Go!” Huo Zhao waved his hand dismissively.
After the Bone-Eroding King left, Young Master Huo looked at Huo Zhao and asked, “Father, where do we have a million immortal stones?”
If the Eight Halls had a million immortal stones, they wouldn’t need to come to the First Heaven, plundering everywhere.
“Just painting a big picture, otherwise why would they risk their lives for you?”
Huo Zhao gave a cold smile.
Young Master Huo nodded, as if coming to a realisation.
…
Cangxuan Continent!
On a floating island, a waterfall cascaded down like the Milky Way, surrounded by the chirping of birds and the fragrance of flowers, resembling a paradise on earth.
“So beautiful…”
Mo Qingyun gazed at the floating island before her, unable to resist lying down on the grass. “All these years, what I’ve missed most is this floating island.”
“You only miss this floating island, not me?” Lan Lianhua rolled her eyes and said.
“Of course I missed you too!” Mo Qingyun gave a faint smile.
On the floating island, Lan Lianhua had already ordered spiritual fruits and immortal wine to be prepared.
The group sat amidst a sea of flowers, surrounded by swirling spiritual energy and circling immortal cranes, like a hidden utopia.
“Come, Friend Chen, try our Cangxuan Continent’s unique ‘Nine-Turn Spiritual Wine’. It’s brewed from thousand-year-old spiritual fruits and greatly benefits cultivation!”
Lan Lianhua raised her cup with a warm smile, her eyes full of enthusiasm.
Chen Ping took the wine cup and sipped lightly. Instantly, a warm stream of spiritual energy surged through his limbs and bones, invigorating his spirit.
“Good wine!”
Chen Ping praised.
Hu Mazi had already gulped it down, his face full of delight. “Hahaha, this is far better than mortal wine!”
Mo Qingyun leaned against a spiritual tree, gazing at the distant waterfall with nostalgia in her eyes. “When I was young, I often came here to cultivate. I always felt this place had an indescribable mystery.”
Hearing this, Chen Ping’s heart stirred.
He looked around, and for some reason, he felt something odd about this floating island.
Though the spiritual energy on the island was rich, it didn’t seem naturally formed but rather deliberately gathered by some force.
Even stranger, when he probed with his divine sense, he faintly detected a subtle ripple of a restriction, as if something was hidden.
“Could it be… this island holds a secret?” Chen Ping mused to himself.
Just as he was pondering, a deep voice from the Red Cloud Demon Lord suddenly echoed in his sea of consciousness:
“Kid, something’s off about this place.”
Chen Ping frowned, responding with his divine sense, “What did you find, Senior?”
“This island… it’s not naturally formed.”
The Red Cloud Demon Lord’s voice carried a hint of gravity. “It should be an ancient ruin, forcibly lifted into the air by an array and disguised as an ordinary floating island.”
“A ruin?!” Chen Ping’s heart jolted.
“Indeed, and the restrictions on this ruin are extremely strong, likely even a peak Loose Immortal couldn’t break through them forcibly.”
The Red Cloud Demon Lord mused, “If there’s a chance, it might be worth exploring. You could find something valuable.”
Chen Ping’s eyes flickered, about to ask more, when suddenly—
“Boom!!”
A deafening explosion came from the distant horizon, and then the entire Cangxuan Continent shook violently!
“What’s happening?!”
Lan Lianhua stood up abruptly, her face changing drastically.
A cultivator from Cangxuan Continent flew over in a hurry, his face full of panic. “Report! The Bone-Eroding King is leading a group of demonic cultivators, attacking our border array!”
“What?!” Everyone was shocked.
“We’ve never had any grudges with Bone-Eroding City. Why would they suddenly attack us?”
“And Bone-Eroding City’s strength is no match for our Cangxuan Continent.”
Lan Lianhua said, utterly perplexed.
