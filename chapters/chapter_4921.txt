“Don’t worry, there’s only ever a tired ox, never a ruined field. Come on, let’s go for a walk.”
Chen Ping patted Xiu Rui on the shoulder, and the two headed out.
But just as they stepped out of the inn, they ran into the big man and the blue-eyed man.
The big man, seeing Chen Ping, was slightly taken aback before quickly greeting, “Friend, what a coincidence…”
“Quite a coincidence…”
Chen Ping nodded, said little, and led Xiu Rui onto the street.
The big man and the blue-eyed man exchanged a glance before quietly following them.
Just as the two were about to make a move on Chen Ping and Xiu Rui, they saw a group of soldiers clad in black armour approaching!
There were over a dozen of them, each exuding an overwhelmingly powerful aura.
Chen Ping and Xiu Rui hurriedly stepped aside, afraid of blocking the way. Any one of these soldiers, if placed in a lower plane world, would be among the top experts.
Seeing this, the big man and the blue-eyed man immediately abandoned their plan to act. These were Rhino City’s war soldiers, incredibly strong.
Moreover, they carried a chilling, murderous aura, one forged through countless battles and bloodshed.
“Damn, that’s terrifying. These soldiers are so formidable,” Xiu Rui said, watching the passing soldiers with a shocked expression.
“It’s normal. This is the Heavenly Realm. If we went to an even higher plane of the Heavenly Realm, even the gatekeepers would probably be Golden Immortals,” Chen Ping said with a slight smile.
“That’s true. Back in the Wuxu Realm, I was a legend, but here, I’m just gatekeeper level,” Xiu Rui said with an embarrassed smile.
“No need to feel discouraged. As long as we take it slow, we’ll definitely get better and better,” Chen Ping said, patting Xiu Rui’s shoulder.
Chen Ping himself was no different. In the Human Realm, he was now like an emperor, doing whatever he pleased.
But here, he had to be cautious, even stepping aside for a squad of soldiers.
As night fell, massive flames rose around Rhino City, illuminating the entire city as brightly as day.
The streets were bustling with noise and activity, filled with a lively, market-like atmosphere.
In a large square, a hundred-metre-high platform had been erected, where two people were currently engaged in hand-to-hand combat.
The surrounding crowd cheered loudly, with squads of war soldiers maintaining order.
Chen Ping could tell at a glance that this platform was officially constructed, not some privately set-up arena.
Chen Ping and Xiu Rui squeezed through the crowd, unaware of the big man and the blue-eyed man trailing them.
“Brother, what’s this about?” Chen Ping asked a middle-aged man after pushing his way in.
The middle-aged man glanced at Chen Ping and said, “Just arrived through the Great Dao, huh?”
“Yes, yes!” Chen Ping nodded repeatedly.
“This is a fighting arena. Win one match, and you get fifty immortal coins.”
“There are only ten matches a day. If someone can win all ten matches undefeated, they can earn a thousand immortal coins as a reward.”
“Plus, there’s a chance to enter the City Lord’s Mansion and join the City Lord’s war soldier team.”
The middle-aged man explained.
“What kind of fighting is this? Just punching and kicking, like kids scrapping,” Xiu Rui said, chuckling as he watched the fight on the platform.
“What do you know? This is the manliest kind of contest. You’re only allowed to use physical strength, no techniques or aura.”
“Our beast clan values strength above all. It’s about who’s got more power, whose body is tougher,” the middle-aged man said, giving Xiu Rui a displeased look.
Xiu Rui laughed awkwardly, realising he wasn’t part of the beast clan and didn’t understand their ways.
But the beast clan indeed revered strength, with everyone aspiring to be a model of boundless power.
