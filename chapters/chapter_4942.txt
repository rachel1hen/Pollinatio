Just as Chen Ping was basking in his delight, a terrifyingly powerful aura suddenly struck!
Rumble…
Caught off guard, Chen Ping was hit directly by the overwhelming force, his body instantly sent flying!
He crashed heavily onto the ground, spitting out a mouthful of blood.
“Bloody hell… who the fuck ambushed me?”
Chen Ping furrowed his brow. He had been peacefully absorbing the sinister energy, so why would someone suddenly attack him?
Since these malevolent spirits lacked intelligence, they couldn’t possibly have ambushed him.
Chen Ping suspected there might be other cultivators in the purgatory, launching a surprise attack on him.
As he slowly got to his feet and saw the scene before him, he was utterly stunned.
His earlier relaxed and carefree demeanour vanished, replaced by a grave expression.
“A demon corpse?” the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord remarked in surprise, “This blasted place is quite sinister, to actually give rise to a demon corpse.”
Before Chen Ping stood a massive demon corpse, shambling towards him. Its body was entirely rotted, emitting a foul stench, with patches of stark white bone exposed.
The sight was so revolting that Chen Ping couldn’t help but retch.
As the demon corpse advanced, the ground trembled violently with each step. Standing a hundred metres tall, it was like a moving mountain.
When it reached Chen Ping, the corpse slowly lowered its head, its eyes glaring at him with ferocious malice.
Before Chen Ping could react, it swung a massive palm down towards him.
The giant hand covered a hundred-metre radius around Chen Ping!
But just as the palm descended, Chen Ping’s figure vanished in an instant.
With his Fire Control Step, he could teleport several miles in a blink, easily avoiding the strike.
The moment he disappeared, a blinding sword light shot into the sky, aimed straight at the demon corpse.
Rumble…
The sword light struck the corpse’s body, unleashing a cataclysmic shockwave that sent Chen Ping flying once more!
The surrounding malevolent spirits were obliterated, reduced to ashes by the blast.
Chen Ping struggled to stabilise himself, landing on the ground, and looked at the demon corpse. To his shock, his sword strike hadn’t killed it.
The corpse’s flesh was rotted, its bones exposed, looking like it should crumble under a single blow. Yet, despite its decrepit appearance, it withstood Chen Ping’s attack.
“Again…”
Chen Ping leapt into the air, brandishing his Dragon-Slaying Sword and unleashing another strike!
Boom!
This time, his sword light was infused with boundless flames. The moment it connected with the demon corpse, the creature’s massive body burst into flames!
Engulfed in fire, the corpse let out roars and screams of agony.
Finally, it collapsed in the inferno with a thunderous crash.
Chen Ping landed, watching the demon corpse consumed by flames, and quickly used his Heart Condensation Technique to absorb the sinister energy emanating from its body.
“Looks like supreme fire is the way to deal with these things!”
A smirk curved Chen Ping’s lips. Now that he’d found a way to handle the demon corpse, there was nothing to fear.
Meanwhile, in the city lord’s mansion, Niu Mang’s brows knitted tightly as he witnessed the supreme fire in Chen Ping’s sword strike, “Demon clan’s supreme fire? This kid really is from the demon clan?”
Niu Mang’s fists clenched unconsciously. If Chen Ping was indeed a demon and dared to enter the purgatory, Niu Mang would never let him off.
Wasn’t this a blatant slap to his face?
If word of this got out, Niu Mang felt he’d be a laughingstock.
Unaware that his every move was being watched, Chen Ping continued to act freely in the purgatory. With no one else around, he had no need to hold back!
