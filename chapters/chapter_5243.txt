At the critical moment, a figure appeared in front of Chen Ping like a phantom.
It was a middle-aged man in coarse linen clothes, average in build and appearance, like a common blacksmith.
But his strike was lightning-fast, a simple punch aimed at the beast’s head.
There was no earth-shattering aura, no dazzling light; the punch carried barely any spiritual energy.
Yet, the ferocious three-eyed lion, under this blow, seemed to have been hit by a mountain. It let out a piercing wail, its massive body halting abruptly, staggering back a few steps, eyes filled with fear.
The brocade-robed young man, caught off guard, nearly fell off the beast’s back.
Steadying himself, he glared at the middle-aged man, shouting furiously, “Who the hell are you? Daring to meddle in my business? Do you know who I am?”
The middle-aged man glanced at him calmly, his tone even, “Sword Saint City has its rules. Here, no matter who you are, you follow them. Acting high and mighty because of your family’s influence? No one will indulge you.”
With that, he didn’t spare the young man another look, turning and vanishing into the crowd as if he’d never been there.
The brocade-robed man stared at the man’s retreating figure, then at the odd glances from passersby, his face alternating between pale and flushed.
He snorted, a scornful smirk curling his lips, and said to his attendant, “A bunch of bumpkins, what do they know?”
Patting the three-eyed lion’s head, he rode the beast arrogantly into the city.
As he passed Chen Ping, he paused, sizing him up.
Seeing Chen Ping was only a Loose Immortal Realm cultivator, the brocade-robed man was visibly surprised.
He dismounted, waved a hand, and the beast vanished.
“A Loose Immortal Realm cultivator, how did you get here?” the brocade-robed man asked curiously.
“Is there a rule saying Loose Immortals can’t come here?” Chen Ping retorted, unflinching.
The young man paused, then burst into laughter, “You’ve got guts! Low cultivation but bold. Why didn’t you dodge just now?”
“Scared, legs went weak, couldn’t move…” Chen Ping said.
The young man froze, then roared with laughter, “What an interesting bloke! You’re new to Sword Saint City, right? I’m Zhao Tianyi. Be my lackey, stick with me.”
“Know what my name means? Tianyi, Tianyi—in the Heavenly Realm, I’m number one…”
Hu Mazi, “…”
“You’re full of it…” Chen Ping said calmly.
“You don’t believe me?” Zhao Tianyi asked.
Chen Ping shook his head, “Not unless you show me something to prove it. I’m not following someone who’s all talk.”
“Everyone knows my name, Zhao Tianyi, and you don’t believe me?”
“Here’s a million immortal stones. Take them. If it’s not enough, just ask your big brother.”
Zhao Tianyi tossed out a storage pouch containing a million immortal stones.
Chen Ping glanced at it, realizing this guy wasn’t bluffing—he really had a million immortal stones!
Handing out a million immortal stones so casually, this guy was either an idiot or a spoiled second-generation heir.
“Big brother…” Chen Ping pocketed the storage pouch.
One “big brother” for a million immortal stones? Worth it!
“Haha, in Sword Saint City, if anyone dares bully you, just drop my name. It’ll work wonders!”
Zhao Tianyi said, then strutted into Sword Saint City.
“Chen Ping, is this guy an idiot?” Hu Mazi stared at Zhao Tianyi’s back, unable to hold back.
Taking on a lackey and giving away a million immortal stones just like that? Was he mad?
“I don’t know if he’s an idiot, but this trip wasn’t for nothing!”
Chen Ping’s lips curved slightly, and he followed Hu Mazi into Sword Saint City.
Inside, Chen Ping glanced back at the man and woman on the gate towers. They stood motionless, their sword intents clashing at their peak. It wouldn’t be long before both were gravely injured.
A golden light flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes, and an invisible sword intent shot out.
The man and woman on the gate trembled, their faces filled with shock as they both looked toward Chen Ping.
But Chen Ping, already walking forward with Hu Mazi, left them staring only at his back.
