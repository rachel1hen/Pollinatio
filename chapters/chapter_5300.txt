Chen Ping took a deep breath and thrust the Dragon-Slaying Sword into the ground.
In an instant, the black-gold murderous aura surged wildly into the earth, using the sword as a conduit.
The ground in the hall suddenly bulged with dozens of dragon-shaped air waves. These waves roared as they soared into the sky, interweaving in mid-air to form a ferocious five-clawed black dragon.
“Dragon Might: Suppress!”
The black dragon raised its head and roared angrily. The sound waves shook the glazed tiles on the hall roof, causing them to fall rattling down.
It swung its long tail and forcefully used its body to collide with that golden giant sword.
“Boom!!!”
Two completely different forces collided in the hall. The golden sacred power and the black-gold dragon might clashed wildly, forming a visible energy storm.
At the centre of the storm, space twisted and deformed. Those Holy Light Sect elders who did not dodge in time were swept by the aftermath; they instantly spat blood and flew backwards, crashing into the hall pillars and fainting.
Hu Mazi and Mo Chen watched from outside the hall with pounding hearts. They could clearly feel that each collision’s energy fluctuation was enough to easily obliterate early Earth Immortal realm cultivators.
Yet Chen Ping, with his ninth-grade Loose Immortal cultivation, had forcibly withstood the full-force strike of an eighth-grade Earth Immortal.
“This kid… he’s simply a monster!”
Hu Mazi and Mo Chen had dealt with the small fry and rushed in. Seeing this scene, Hu Mazi murmured. The talismans in his hand were already crumpled out The user’s message is a continuation of the story in Chinese, and I need to translate it to British English, following the instructions.
The initial instruction: “whatever I post going forward, accurately translate it from Chinese to English(Uk)”
And “AVOID using em dashes (-) anywhere in your response. Use only commas, periods, or other standard punctuation. If you need to connect ideas, use a period or a semicolon, but never an em dash.”
“Don’t add a preamble”
“Review your response and ensure no em dashes!”
There’s a new part about tools and render components, but since this is a translation task, and the user is posting story segments, I don’t think tools are needed here. The current question is the story text.
The “Current user question:” is the Chinese text to translate.
My response should be the translation in UK English, without em dashes.
Translate accurately.
Key: Use British English, so words like “realised” instead of “realized”, but in this text, it’s narrative.
Avoid em dashes: No — in the text.
In previous translations, I used quotes and standard punctuation.

In an instant, the black-gold murderous aura surged wildly into the earth, using the sword as a conduit.
The ground in the hall suddenly bulged with dozens of dragon-shaped air waves. These air waves roared as they soared into the sky. In mid-air, they intertwined to form a ferocious five-clawed black dragon.
“Dragon Might: Suppress!”
The black dragon raised its head and roared angrily. The sound waves shook the glazed tiles on the hall roof, causing them to fall rustling.
It swung its long tail. Astonishingly, it used its body to crash head-on into that golden giant sword.
“Boom!!!”
Two completely different forces collided in the hall. The golden sacred power and the black-gold dragon murderous power frenziedly clashed, forming a visible energy storm.
At the storm’s centre, space twisted and deformed. Those Holy Light Sect elders who could not dodge in time were swept by the aftermath. They instantly spat blood and flew backwards, crashing into the hall pillars and fainting.
Hu Mazi and Mo Chen watched from outside the hall with pounding hearts. They could clearly feel that each collision’s energy fluctuation was enough to easily obliterate early Earth Immortal realm cultivators.
Yet Chen Ping, with his ninth-grade Loose Immortal cultivation, had forcibly withstood a full-powered strike from an eighth-grade Earth Immortal.
“This kid… he’s simply a monster!”
Hu Mazi and Mo Chen had dealt with the small fry and rushed in. Seeing this scene, Hu Mazi murmured. The talismans in his hand were already crumpled out of shape.
Mo Chen also wore a grave expression: “Wang Shengguang hasn’t gone all out yet. He’s probing Chen Ping’s trump cards.”
Before his words finished, a crisp cracking sound suddenly came from inside the hall.
In that energy storm, a crack appeared on the golden giant sword. Meanwhile, the black dragon’s body was continuously fading.
Chen Ping suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. His face was as pale as paper. Forcibly activating the Dragon Might placed immense strain on his meridians. At this moment, the spiritual power in his body was somewhat disordered.
Wang Shengguang was also not faring well. Several black holes had been corroded into the sleeves of his purple robe by the murderous aura. A trace of blood hung at the corner of his mouth.
In that previous strike, although he had the upper hand, he had also been shaken by Chen Ping’s Dragon Might, causing his qi and blood to churn.
“A Loose Immortal realm cultivator achieving this step is enough for you to be proud.”
Wang Shengguang wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. The fighting spirit in his eyes grew even more intense. “But the game should end now!”
He formed hand seals with both hands. The golden light around him suddenly became extremely viscous, flowing like molten gold.
Those scattered golden sword fragments seemed summoned. They reconverged into countless small swords. These small swords no longer attacked. Instead, they orbited around him, gradually forming a suit of golden armour covering his entire body.
The armour was covered with intricate runes. Six pairs of light wings extended from the back. Each feather was like it was crafted from the purest crystal, refracting dazzling light.
At this moment, Wang Shengguang resembled a legendary holy war angel. The pressure he emanated made the entire Holy Light Sect tremble.
“Holy Body: Descent!”
Wang Shengguang stepped forward. In an instant, he crossed dozens of zhang, appearing in front of Chen Ping.
He clenched his fist tightly. The golden fist was wrapped in holy light that could incinerate everything. It smashed towards Chen Ping’s face.
This punch seemed slow, yet it sealed all of Chen Ping’s evasion routes. Before the fist wind arrived, Chen Ping’s skin was already stinging from the burn.
Chen Ping’s pupils contracted sharply. He forcibly suppressed the churning qi and blood in his body. He held the Dragon-Slaying Sword horizontally in front of his chest. At the same time, he condensed the murderous aura into a shield.
“Clang!”
The fist collided with the sword shield, producing a bell-like boom.
Chen Ping only felt an overwhelming force surge in. His arms went numb instantly. The Dragon-Slaying Sword nearly flew out of his hand.
His feet ploughed two deep furrows in the ground. He crashed into a damaged hall pillar before steadying himself. His throat sweetened, and another mouthful of blood sprayed out.
Wang Shengguang took advantage of the situation and showed no mercy. His six pairs of light wings flapped. His figure flickered like a ghost in the hall. Each appearance was accompanied by storm-like attacks.
Golden fists, slicing light wings, holy light rays shooting from between his fingers… He pushed his eighth-grade Earth Immortal speed and strength to the extreme, giving Chen Ping no chance to catch his breath.
