“How will you know if you don’t try!”
Chen Ping’s eyes were filled with determination. With his apparent strength, triggering the thunder tribulation to break open the passage to the Fourth Heaven should pose no problem!
On the plaza outside the Seventh Hall, Chen Ping sat cross-legged.
He took a deep breath, his internal spiritual energy surging wildly. The cultivation of the Sixth Grade Loose Immortal Realm was released without reservation, causing the surrounding air to ripple with the force of his spiritual energy.
“What’s Chen Ping doing?”
Huo Jingjing looked at Chen Ping on the plaza, asking with concern.
The Seventh Hall Master’s expression was grave, “He’s going to forcibly trigger the thunder tribulation, using its power to break open the passage to the Fourth Heaven!”
“What?” Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun exclaimed simultaneously.
Triggering a thunder tribulation was already fraught with danger; a single misstep could lead to death and annihilation. Yet, Chen Ping was attempting to use the tribulation’s power to break open a spatial passage, practically gambling with his life!
In the sky, the previously clear weather suddenly turned overcast. Dark clouds gathered, lightning snakes slithered through the layers, and a terrifying pressure enveloped the entire Black Wind Abyss.
“It’s coming!” the Seventh Hall Master said in a low voice.
Boom!
A thick purple thunderbolt, like a divine dragon, emerged from the clouds, carrying an aura of destruction as it struck towards Chen Ping.
Chen Ping abruptly opened his eyes, a glint of ferocity flashing within. His internal spiritual energy surged to its peak, and the Dragon-Slaying Sword appeared in his hand, slashing towards the thunderbolt.
Golden sword energy collided with the purple thunder, producing a deafening roar as wild energy spread in all directions.
Chen Ping was forced back several steps, a trickle of blood seeping from his mouth, but the fighting spirit in his eyes burned even brighter.
“Bring it on!” Chen Ping shouted, charging towards the thunderclouds in the sky.
Boom! Boom!
Thunderbolts followed one after another, some like sharp swords, others like giant hammers, and some like divine dragons, relentlessly striking at Chen Ping.
Wielding the Dragon-Slaying Sword, Chen Ping shattered the thunderbolts, his golden sword energy weaving through them, forming a sturdy barrier.
But the tribulation’s power grew stronger, and wounds began to appear on Chen Ping’s body, his clothes stained red with blood.
“Chen Ping!”
Huo Jingjing watched with her heart in her throat, unable to hold back from wanting to rush forward to help, but the Seventh Hall Master stopped her.
“This is a trial he must face alone, we cannot help him,” the Seventh Hall Master said solemnly, his eyes also filled with worry.
On the plaza, Chen Ping’s aura grew increasingly unstable, yet his gaze became ever more resolute.
He could feel his body being tempered by the thunder, growing stronger, while his internal spiritual energy was continuously compressed and refined.
“Now’s the moment!”
With a stir in his heart, Chen Ping channelled all his spiritual energy into the Dragon-Slaying Sword, slashing towards the thickest golden thunderbolt.
The golden sword energy collided with the golden thunder, erupting in dazzling light that illuminated the entire Black Wind Abyss.
Crack!
With a sharp sound, the thunderclouds in the sky were sliced open by the sword, revealing a gap. A passage to an unknown space slowly opened within, emitting powerful spatial fluctuations.
Seizing the moment, Chen Ping absorbed the energy dissipating from the thunder tribulation, replenishing his spiritual energy and healing some of his wounds.
He leaped forward, arriving before the passage.
“Chen Ping!” Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun hurriedly ran over, their eyes filled with reluctance.
“I’m leaving,” Chen Ping said softly, looking at the two.
“Take care of yourself.”
Huo Jingjing’s voice trembled, tears welling in her eyes.
Mo Qingyun also looked at Chen Ping, hesitating to speak, finally saying only, “We’ll wait for your return.”
Chen Ping nodded, giving them a deep look before turning to Hu Mazi, “Master Hu, let’s go.”
