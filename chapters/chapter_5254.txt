Mo Chen glanced at them, sighed, “I warned you before, the information from the Information Tower isn’t always reliable, you need to discern it yourselves.
It seems they saw you were unfamiliar and eager for news, so they deliberately used false information about Black Wind Valley to deceive you, making a quick profit.”
“Outrageous!”
Hu Mazi slammed the table, “We’re going to confront them now, make them refund us!”
Chen Ping’s face was icy cold, a million immortal stones was a small matter, but being toyed with like this was unbearable.
“Senior, we’ll be right back.”
With that, he and Hu Mazi turned and headed towards the Information Tower.
“Master, should I stop Brother Chen?” Ling Xue asked Mo Chen.
“No need, let them go, a lesson learned the hard way,” Mo Chen replied.
Soon, Chen Ping and Hu Mazi stepped back into the Information Tower. The same maid who had previously attended them stood in the hall, a flicker of surprise crossing her face as she saw them return.
She quickly resumed her professional smile, “Gentlemen, is there anything else you need?”
“Refund.”
Chen Ping got straight to the point, his tone cold, “The information you gave was false, Black Wind Valley isn’t a branch of the Evil Path Hall.”
The maid’s smile faded, she shook her head, “Sir, our Information Tower’s rule is clear: once information is sold, no refunds.”
“What nonsense rule!”
Hu Mazi roared, “You sell fake information to scam people and refuse a refund? Believe me, I’ll tear this place down!”
The maid seemed unafraid, her tone firm, “Please behave, sir! Our Information Tower has stood in Sword Saint City for years, we have our rules.
We only provide information, its accuracy isn’t guaranteed, it’s your misjudgment, how can you blame us?
A refund? Absolutely impossible!”
“You!” Hu Mazi was about to act, but Chen Ping held him back tightly.
Chen Ping stared at the maid, his gaze as cold as ice. He knew fighting here would gain them nothing, the Information Tower’s boldness surely had backing.
“Didn’t you say if the information was wrong, you’d refund in full?” Chen Ping demanded.
“Did I? I don’t recall, ask around, when has our Information Tower ever refunded?”
The maid spoke arrogantly.
“Damn it, denying what you said?” Hu Mazi was furious.
Chen Ping’s eyes narrowed, equally enraged by the maid.
“Are you refunding or not?” Chen Ping asked coldly.
“No refund!” the maid declared.
“Master Hu, take her down…” Chen Ping said to Hu Mazi.
Hu Mazi, like a ravenous tiger, lunged at the maid.
She tried to resist, but Chen Ping swiftly restrained her.
The maid, only at the fourth rank of Earth Immortal, was caught off guard and immobilised by Chen Ping and Hu Mazi.
Hu Mazi went at her like a madman.
Onlookers stopped in their tracks, hearing only the maid’s screams but seeing nothing.
In just over ten minutes, the maid fell silent.
Hu Mazi had killed her.
Inside the Information Tower, the maid’s body slumped to the ground, blood slowly seeping from beneath her, staining the polished floor.
The surrounding cultivators who had paused to watch erupted in shock, gasps echoing around.
“Madness! They dared to kill here!”
“That’s an Information Tower member, are these two tired of living?”
“Look, the Information Tower guards are coming!”
With angry shouts, a group emerged swiftly from the depths of the Information Tower.
Leading them was a middle-aged man in a brocade robe, his face stern but now pale with fury, his eyes like ice as he stared at the body, then sharply at Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, a powerful aura radiating from him, making the surrounding air feel almost frozen.
