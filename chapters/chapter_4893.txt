And he still had to say goodbye to everyone, especially in the Mortal Realm, where he had many loved ones!
Chen Ping recounted everything about Su Yuqi to the group!
He had to go to the Celestial Realm and bring Su Yuqi back!
After explaining everything, Chen Ping comforted all the women, treating each one equally without favouritism!
Fortunately, Chen Ping’s physical body was exceptionally strong, even dual cultivating with so many women didn’t leave him breathless, he was like a walking pile driver!
Once he had settled matters in the Celestial Human Realm, Chen Ping swung his Dragon-Slaying Sword, slicing through the void with a single strike, a pitch-black rift slowly forming!
Chen Ping stepped into the void rift, and his vision went dark!
When he opened his eyes again, he found himself in the Mortal Realm!
Hovering in mid-air, looking down at the Mortal Realm beneath his feet, Chen Ping felt a wave of emotion. Now that he had returned to the Mortal Realm, he was like a true god descending!
At that moment, in the Dragon Gate of the capital, Ji Ruxue was leading the women in cultivation. Since they had all been intimate with Chen Ping, his bloodline flowed within them!
As a result, their cultivation speed was astonishingly fast. After a session of practice, the women began to rest!
“Sister Ruxue, hasn’t it been a year already? Can we open the passage between the Mortal Realm and the Celestial Human Realm to see Chen Ping?”
Wu Meier asked Ji Ruxue!
“I don’t know, let’s go ask Master Hu!” Ji Ruxue had always played the role of the big sister among the women!
With Chen Ping absent, it was Ji Ruxue who had been managing the entire Dragon Gate!
Long Ruotong was also cared for meticulously by these girls, so she was very fond of and pleased with her daughters-in-law!
Next to the Dragon Gate was a very small courtyard, where Hu Mazi had been cultivating for the past year!
He hadn’t touched a woman in that time, focusing solely on cultivation!
When Ji Ruxue and the others came to find Hu Mazi, he had already opened his eyes, gazing at the clear blue sky!
At that moment, Hu Mazi seemed transformed, exuding an air of仙风道骨 (immortal charm and Taoist grace)!
His eyes shone with brilliance, no longer the lecherous glint they once held!
“Master Hu, the year is up. How do we open the passage between the Mortal Realm and the Celestial Human Realm to go see Chen Ping?”
Ji Ruxue asked Hu Mazi!
Hu Mazi looked at the sky and suddenly gave a faint smile, “We don’t need to go find him, he’s already here…”
“He’s here?”
Ji Ruxue and the others were startled, all turning their gazes to the sky in unison!
Sure enough, a figure descended from the heavens. Before they could even make out who it was, the figure had already landed in front of them!
“Chen Ping?”
Seeing that it was indeed Chen Ping, Ji Ruxue and the others were utterly shocked!
Chen Ping looked at Ji Ruxue and the women, feeling both excited and thrilled, it had been a year since they last met!
The women rushed towards Chen Ping, pouring out their emotions, and Chen Ping responded with equal passion!
The dry wood and fierce fire blazed intensely!
“Bloody hell, go somewhere else, somewhere else, don’t disturb my Taoist heart!”
Hu Mazi shouted!
With a gentle wave of Chen Ping’s hand, a barrier appeared. Hu Mazi could only hear sounds but see nothing!
He could only sit cross-legged, desperately cultivating, but those sounds left Hu Mazi sweating profusely!
After who-knows-how-long, the barrier vanished, and Chen Ping walked over to Hu Mazi. Seeing Hu Mazi’s flustered state, he smiled faintly, “Master Hu, since when did you become so pure and ascetic? This isn’t like you!”
“Get lost, get lost, you come back and immediately mess with my Taoist heart, nearly shattering it!”
Hu Mazi shot Chen Ping a glare!
Chen Ping sized up Hu Mazi, and suddenly a look of astonishment flashed in his eyes!
“Master Hu, you… your immortal bones?”
Chen Ping realised that Hu Mazi’s body was filled with immortal bones, and his strength didn’t seem the slightest bit inferior to his own!
