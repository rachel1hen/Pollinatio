Looking at Elder Chu’s appearance, Zuo Tianzheng couldn’t help but let out a cold laugh, then this time he said, “Alright, I know that you don’t have the ability to knock out the Xiao Imperial Dynasty, and I won’t let you go to your death, but right now there is an important thing that needs to be given to you to do!”
Elder Chu was instantly relieved to hear this and hurriedly asked, “Allied Lord, if there’s anything you can command, I’ll definitely do my best ……”
“Recently, many of the devil cultivators in our Demon Sealing Alliance have been foolishly moving, and even those who have co-operated with us have all had the heart to rebel.”
“I got reliable news, someone is secretly hiding a large group of devil cultivators, and these devil cultivators are all locked up in hidden places, you take someone to go and poke around properly.”
“Our Northern Domain, we must not allow such people to exist, and even more so, we must not allow demonic cultivators that do not belong to the control of our Demon Sealing Alliance to exist, only by taking care of things in the Northern Domain can we have the strength to follow the Xiao Imperial Dynasty in a confrontation.”
“As for that Chen Ping, there is no need to be in charge of him, a hundred years of offerings is tempting enough, there will definitely be people who will go after him!”
Zuo Tianzheng said to Elder Chu!
“What? Our Northern Domain even has a demonic cultivator, or a demonic cultivator that has been hidden away? What kind of person is it that has the guts to do such a thing.”
“Don’t worry alliance master, I will definitely find out this matter, as long as the devil cultivators who don’t submit to our Demon Sealing Alliance, all of them will be chopped to death ……”
Elder Chu said with confidence!
At this time, he felt that he was able to do it again, and was not at all in the same state as when he had just been asked to deal with Xiao Huangzhao!
After all, after so many years, there shouldn’t be many devil cultivators in the Northern Region, and their strength couldn’t be too high, after all, the headquarters of the Demon Sealing Alliance was located in the Northern Region, and the space for devil cultivators to survive in the Northern Region was very small!
“Go ……”
Zuo Tianzheng waved his hand!
Elder Chu slowly retreated out and immediately brought people to start investigating this matter!
…………
Southern Domain, Mu Family!
Tan Rongkun arrived with his people, but was stopped by the Mu Family’s guards!
“Who are you people? What business do you have coming to our Mu Family?”
A guard asked at Tan Rongkun!
“We are here to find your family’s Young Master Mu Qing, please inform us.”
Tan Rongkun said politely!
The guard sized up Tan Rongkun, then shook his head and said, “No, our young master is going to have a competition in a couple of days, and is now taking the time to build up his strength, Chief Liu has explained that he won’t see anyone.”
“You guys go, these few days our Mu family also closed the door, do not entertain anyone ……”
“Daring, you a Mu family small guard, also dare to talk like this ……”
One of the disciples brought by Tan Rongkun saw that all the Mu Family guards were so bullish, he was instantly enraged and wanted to go forward to teach a lesson!
However, he was stopped by Tan Rongkun, after all, he came this time, in addition to taking a look at Mu Qing, he also needed the Mu Family’s help to send a group of cultivators!
It wouldn’t be good to follow the Mu Family to a standstill!
“Little brother, truth be told, I’m a friend of your young master Mu Qing, and I’d like you to go and say something.”
Tan Rongkun said, pulling out some purple gold spirit coins and handing them over to that guard!
But who knew that the guard even knocked the purple gold spirit coins out of Tan Rongkun’s hand, and said with a cold expression, “Leave immediately, otherwise don’t blame us for not being polite.”
This time, Tan Rongkun also came up temper, he is after all a Mahayana realm expert, being blocked by two guards like this is too humiliating!
Only to see Tan Rongkun’s internal breath slightly vibration, two Mu family guards to not have time to any action, all instantly stretched to the ground, fear in the eyes!
Tan Rongkun did not kill, after all, these Mu family members can be taught a lesson, if killed, it would be bad!
“Go ……”
Tan Rongkun led his men straight into the Mu family!
