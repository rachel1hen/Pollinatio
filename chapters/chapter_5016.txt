The Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord was now beginning to entertain thoughts of retreat!
“Stop…” Chen Ping shouted loudly!
His voice rang in Huo Zhao’s ears, “Lord Huo, we meet again?”
Huo Zhao turned, seeing Chen Ping, his brows furrowed, eyes blazing with rage, “Chen Ping! So it was you who took my son, release him at once!”
“You say release, and I should? Who do you think you are? Don’t forget, you’re my defeated foe!”
Though heavily injured, Chen Ping’s swaggering bravado remained intact.
“Hmph, that was merely a wisp of my divine soul, while you relied on another’s soul possession, technically, I didn’t lose to you.”
Huo Zhao snorted coldly!
Huo Shizi listened, stunned, he hadn’t expected his father to know Chen Ping!
And his father’s injury was caused by this Chen Ping!
“No matter, your son’s in my hands, I’m telling you to retreat now and abandon Flying Tiger City!”
Chen Ping threatened Huo Zhao.
“You dare touch my son?” Huo Zhao’s gaze was icy as he stared at Chen Ping!
“What don’t I dare?” Chen Ping sneered, his sword lightly grazing Huo Shizi’s neck, drawing a thin line of blood, “We only want Flying Tiger City, but you want your son’s life.”
“Father, save me, Father, save me…”
Feeling the cold sting at his neck, Huo Shizi frantically shouted at Huo Zhao.
The battlefield fell into an eerie stalemate.
Huo Zhao’s face was ashen, his fists clenched so tightly they cracked.
Nearby, Xie Zhong was sweating profusely, terrified that Huo Zhao would give up and retreat!
Flying Tiger City was his, if Huo Zhao abandoned it, what would he do?
He knew, if Flying Tiger City was gone, his usefulness would vanish!
Then he’d meet a miserable end!
Xie Zhong’s body trembled, inwardly praying Huo Zhao wouldn’t retreat!
But in the end, Huo Zhao gritted his teeth, “Chen Ping, if I retreat, will you release my son?”
“Of course, my word is my bond, I swear to the heavens!” Chen Ping raised his hand, “If I don’t release your son, may I suffer heavenly tribulation and never be reborn.”
Hearing Chen Ping’s oath, Huo Zhao fiercely swung his sleeve, “All Eight Halls, withdraw!”
“Lord Huo, don’t go, what about me…”
Xie Zhong, seeing this, tried to beg Huo Zhao to stay.
But Huo Zhao didn’t even glance at him, leaving directly!
Xie Zhong was just a pawn, now useless, Huo Zhao wouldn’t spare him a second look!
They were the Divine Clan, even looking down on the noble human race, let alone the beast clan.
As the Eight Halls’ army retreated, Xie Zhong immediately led the remaining Flying Tiger City warriors to kneel!
“We surrender, we surrender…”
Xie Zhong sought to surrender, hoping for a chance to survive.
But the Demon Dragon Hall didn’t accept, slaughtering all of Flying Tiger City’s people, not sparing even Xie Zhong.
The Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord gave Chen Ping a deep look, a glint of meaning in his soul fire, “Friend Chen, the Demon Dragon Hall will remember today’s favour.”
With that, he led his army to occupy the main city.
Chen Ping sheathed his sword and released the ashen-faced Huo Shizi.
“Thank you for your help, may I know your name? I, Chen Ping, will surely repay you in the future!”
Chen Ping said to the white-robed woman.
“I’m Mo Qingyun,” the white-robed woman smiled faintly.
“Young Miss, we should return, or the Patriarch will worry!”
The purple-robed elder said.
Mo Qingyun nodded, then turned to Chen Ping, “Thank you for saving the people of Cangxuan Continent, if fate allows, we’ll meet again!”
With that, Mo Qingyun and the purple-robed elder prepared to leave.
But as the elder slowly opened a void black hole, Mo Qingyun’s face suddenly changed, and she spat out a mouthful of blood!
