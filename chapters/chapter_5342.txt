Under the deep blue sky, two streams of light broke through the clouds, landing steadily in a dense ancient forest.
Chen Ping retracted the golden light around his body, a stinging sensation from the spatial power when crossing Broken Cloud Ridge still lingered on his fingertips, while Hu Mazi eagerly took a deep breath of air, his face full of amazement.
“Good heavens, the immortal qi in this Sixth Heaven is simply thicker than the spiritual springs in the Fifth Heaven.”
Hu Mazi smacked his lips, spiritual power circulated once through his body, he only felt his meridians become a bit smoother. “This old man has been stuck at the Ninth Grade of Earth Immortal Realm for so long, perhaps staying here for a few months, I can touch the threshold of Human Immortal Realm.”
Chen Ping did not respond, his gaze had already swept over the surroundings.
This ancient forest was completely different from the Black Wind Mountain Range in the Fifth Heaven, the trees were so thick that they required more than ten people to encircle them, the trunks covered with pale golden moss, emitting faint spiritual power fluctuations.
On the ground, fist-sized crystals could be seen everywhere, refracting sunlight, emitting a lustrous glow.
The roars of demon beasts came from afar, their auras so robust that they could make early Earth Immortal Realm cultivators in the Fifth Heaven tremble with fear.
“Be careful.”
Chen Ping pressed on the Dragon Slaying Sword at his waist, the sword body hummed slightly in its sheath, as if warning. “The demon beasts in the Sixth Heaven are not only stronger in strength, they probably also carry some eerie abilities nourished by immortal qi.”
As soon as the words fell, a “crack” sound suddenly came from the dense forest on the left, followed by a gust of wild wind, the fallen leaves on the ground were swept up into the sky.
A colossal creature rushed out from behind the trees, its body covered in blue-black scales, its head like a giant crocodile, yet with three scarlet eyes, a pair of incomplete fleshy wings on its back, saliva dripping from sharp fangs, instantly corroding small pits on the ground where it fell.
“It’s a Three-Eyed Corrosive Scale Beast.”
Hu Mazi’s expression changed slightly, he took out two talismans from his storage bag. “This old man has seen records in ancient books from the Fifth Heaven, this beast’s scales can block attacks from the Seventh Grade of Earth Immortal Realm, its saliva is highly toxic, the most troublesome is its third eye that can spew corrosive qi, if touched it will erode the divine soul.”
The Three-Eyed Corrosive Scale Beast obviously regarded the two as prey, its third eye suddenly lit up with red light, a dark green corrosive qi shot towards Chen Ping like a sharp arrow.
Chen Ping moved his feet slightly, executing the Imperial Fire Step, his figure turned into an afterimage to dodge the corrosive qi, the corrosive qi landed on the ancient tree behind him, the trunk instantly turned black and rotted, in just a few breaths it turned into a pool of black water.
“Good timing.”
Hu Mazi laughed loudly, threw out the talismans in his hand. “Flame Talisman.” Two flames exploded in the air, turning into two fire snakes that coiled towards the Three-Eyed Corrosive Scale Beast.
The fire snakes touched the scales, making “sizzling” sounds, yet failed to break through the defence, only leaving two scorch marks.
The Three-Eyed Corrosive Scale Beast felt pain, roared in anger, opened its huge mouth and bit towards Hu Mazi.
Hu Mazi dared not take it head-on, quickly sacrificed a Wind Travel Talisman, his figure floated back several zhang, at the same time backhanded a Binding Talisman, yellow runes interweaved in the air into a large net, entangling the Three-Eyed Corrosive Scale Beast’s four limbs.
“Chen Ping, make your move.”
Hu Mazi shouted loudly.
A golden light flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes, the divine dragon power in his body circulated wildly, the Dragon Slaying Sword was unsheathed, a golden sword qi carrying raging flames slashed out.
“Dragon Flame Slash.”
The sword qi landed on the back of the Three-Eyed Corrosive Scale Beast, the scales shattered instantly, flames spread along, burning its flesh.
“Roar.”
The Three-Eyed Corrosive Scale Beast let out a shrill scream, struggling to break free from the Binding Talisman, but Hu Mazi had already added several talismans, the runes tightened more and more, binding it firmly in place.
The golden flames continuously devoured its vitality, its aura grew weaker and weaker, finally collapsing to the ground, turning into a pile of charred corpse.
Chen Ping slowly walked forward, the flames on the Dragon Slaying Sword gradually extinguished.
