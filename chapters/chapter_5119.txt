The master snorted coldly, his gaze sweeping towards the collapsed altar at the centre of Shura Hall, “It seems I’ll have to find it myself…”
At that moment, a streak of cyan light tore through the sky, Chen Ping had finally arrived!
He surveyed the scene of mountains of corpses and rivers of blood, the residual energy fluctuations from the self-detonation on the ground, and the master of Tianyuan Pavilion, controlled by the blood corpse not far away. His eyes instantly filled with bloodshot veins.
“Father!”
Sang Lan let out a grief-stricken roar, sensing that her father’s presence had completely vanished.
Huo Jingjing, Mo Qingyun, and Huo Feng arrived shortly after, their faces paling at the horrific sight.
Huo Jingjing covered her mouth, tears glimmering in her eyes, “This… what happened here?”
The entire Shura Hall had become a sea of blood and corpses, not a single living soul remained!
Mo Qingyun and Huo Feng were equally stunned by the scene.
Tragic, it was far too tragic!
Sang Lan’s vision darkened, and she fainted on the spot.
Seeing this, Mo Qingyun supported her, continuously channelling streams of immortal qi into her body.
Sang Lan slowly regained consciousness, looked at Mo Qingyun, and burst into tears, “I have no home, I have no home anymore…”
Seeing Sang Lan’s state, the veins on Chen Ping’s forehead bulged, his eyes already brimming with killing intent.
The master of Tianyuan Pavilion turned, looking at Chen Ping, a sinister smile creeping across his blood-corpse-controlled face, “Oh? You’ve finally arrived, Chen Ping. Perfect, I’ll deal with you too, saves me the trouble.”
Chen Ping said nothing, slowly drawing the Dragon-Slaying Sword. The blade hummed, cyan sword qi swirling around him, forming a sharp aura.
He could feel the power within him boiling. Witnessing Sang Tianyang’s sacrifice and the devastation of Shura Hall, an unprecedented rage burned within him.
“You killed Master Sang, destroyed Shura Hall…”
Chen Ping’s voice was as cold as millennia-old ice, “Today, I’ll make you pay with your blood!”
Before his words faded, Chen Ping transformed into a cyan rainbow, charging at the master of Tianyuan Pavilion.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword unleashed a thousand-zhang-long cyan sword qi with world-splitting might, slicing through the air and leaving a pitch-black spatial rift in its wake.
The master of Tianyuan Pavilion scoffed disdainfully, the blood corpse’s power coursing through him.
He extended his palm, a blood-red vortex reappearing in its centre, effortlessly catching the cyan sword qi.
The sword qi spun wildly in the vortex before dissipating into specks of cyan light.
“Just this much skill?”
The master mocked, then took the initiative, his figure blurring as he appeared before Chen Ping, fingers forming claws aimed at Chen Ping’s heart.
His nails gleamed with a greenish-black hue, clearly laced with deadly poison.
Chen Ping’s eyes narrowed, not retreating but advancing, swiftly bringing the Dragon-Slaying Sword to block his chest.
“Clang…”
The deafening clash of metal rang out. Chen Ping felt an immense force, his arms instantly going numb, his entire body sent flying backwards, carving a trench several zhang deep into the ground.
“Chen Ping!”
Huo Jingjing cried out, wanting to rush forward to help but was held back by Mo Qingyun.
“Don’t go,” Mo Qingyun’s expression was grave, “That guy’s too strong, we’d only be throwing our lives away.”
Chen Ping steadied himself, wiping the blood from his mouth, the fighting spirit in his eyes burning even fiercer.
He knew he couldn’t win in a direct clash, he needed to unleash greater power.
Taking a deep breath, he waved his right hand, and an ancient longbow appeared, the Divine King Bow!
As the Divine King Bow emerged, the energy of the heavens and earth surged wildly. The bow radiated a faint golden glow, its string entwined with threads of the power of laws.
Chen Ping channelled his baleful qi into the bow, his left hand forming a grip, a golden arrow condensed from dao-patterned baleful qi appearing on the string.
“This is… an ancient divine bow?”
For the first time, a trace of wariness flashed in the master of Tianyuan Pavilion’s eyes. He could sense the terrifying energy within that arrow, a force capable of threatening his life.
