“What guts, in a place like this, you actually dare to attack me?”
The old man glared furiously, his aura exploding outward in an instant!
Chen Ping eyed the old man before him, a third-grade Transcendent Immortal didn’t scare him, but to truly show off, he’d need to kill with one strike, something Chen Ping couldn’t quite pull off yet!
“Old fart, I was just testing you earlier, if I wanted to kill you, one sword would do it!”
Chen Ping sneered coldly.
At the same time, within his consciousness, Chen Ping started chatting with the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord, “Senior, if you take over my body, can you kill this old guy with one strike?”
“What’s this? Remembering me now? How long has it been since you last let me stretch my legs?”
The Crimson Cloud Demon Lord gave Chen Ping an annoyed glance, “I could kill him, but I won’t help you…”
“Senior, this chance to show off, I’m handing it to you, it’s also a chance for you to bask in the crowd’s praise and attention, if you’re not up for it, forget it.”
“Though I can’t kill him in one strike, a few extra swings would definitely do the trick.”
Chen Ping played coy, baiting him!
“No, no, no, I was just kidding, hand over your body, this old geezer? I’ll turn him into mush!”
The Crimson Cloud Demon Lord hurriedly stopped Chen Ping!
“Don’t overdo it, if my body can’t handle it and breaks down, you won’t fare well either!”
Chen Ping worried the Demon Lord might go too far and wreck his physical form!
“Relax, I know my limits!” the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord assured.
Chen Ping nodded, then let his consciousness sink in, allowing the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord to take control of his body!
The Demon Lord glanced around, stretched his limbs, looking downright pleased!
“Kid, you’ve got a big mouth, thinking you can kill me with one strike?”
“Let me tell you, even if I stand still, if you can land one sword…”
*Swish…*
Before the old man could finish, Chen Ping swung his sword!
This strike carried no aura, not even a hint of sword energy was visible!
It was as if Chen Ping had casually slashed at thin air!
Just as the crowd puzzled over why Chen Ping’s strike seemed so powerless, they saw the old man’s eyes widen, staring at his own body in disbelief!
*Splatter…*
In an instant, the old man’s body shattered, truly reduced to a pile of gore!
“Holy…!”
“Holy…!”
The crowd, almost in unison, let out a collective curse!
Everyone, in that moment, nearly lost their minds!
A third-grade Transcendent Immortal, taken out with such a nonchalant swing?
And this was a Qian Sect elder, someone with the ability to divine the heavens.
Just like that, with one sword?
The kicker? Chen Ping was only at third-grade Mahayana, this was beyond absurd!
The Tenth Hall Master’s eyes bulged, filled with disbelief.
Since when had Chen Ping gotten this strong?
“Anyone else want a go? Step up, this third-grade Transcendent Immortal was too weak, I couldn’t even stretch my legs properly.”
Chen Ping scanned the crowd, asking with blatant arrogance!
At his words, everyone went numb…
A third-grade Transcendent Immortal, not enough for a third-grade Mahayana like you to stretch your legs?
Was this even human speech?
For a moment, the surroundings fell dead silent!
Everyone stared blankly, not a single soul daring to speak!
In that instant, even those itching to kill Chen Ping for the 200,000 immortal spirit stone bounty gave up the idea!
One sword, slaying a third-grade Transcendent Immortal elder skilled in divination!
This was too damn outrageous, no one could guess Chen Ping’s true ceiling anymore!
“If no one’s stepping up, then scram, and don’t get any funny ideas about me again, or you’ll lose your lives!”
Chen Ping waved a hand, and the crowd scattered like startled birds!
200,000 immortal spirit stones sounded nice, but you’d need a life to spend it!
Once the crowd dispersed, Chen Ping took back control of his body, while the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord reveled in delight.
“It’s been years since I last showed off like this, next time something like this comes up, think of me, yeah?”
The Demon Lord said gleefully!
“Senior, don’t worry, I’ll definitely keep you in mind!” Chen Ping grinned, enjoying the win-win.
The Crimson Cloud Demon Lord got to flex his muscles, and Chen Ping got to strut his stuff.
