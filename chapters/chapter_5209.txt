Black Wind Stronghold is a mountain fortress on the outskirts of Nine Coils Mountain. It is said that the stronghold’s leader is a demon cultivator at the Earth Immortal level, who usually makes a living by plundering passing rogue cultivators, acting with extreme arrogance.
Chen Ping gazed at the dense, impenetrable fog, his brows slightly furrowed, “This fog is unusual, it’s infused with demonic energy, likely concealing an illusion.”
“Demon cultivators are adept at these unorthodox tricks.”
Hu Mazi tightly gripped the short blade at his waist. Ever since receiving his ancestor’s inheritance, his sensitivity to demonic energy had sharpened considerably, “Should we avoid this place?”
“Bypassing it might arouse suspicion.”
Chen Ping shook his head, taking out two Mind-Clearing Pills from his pack, “Take these, they can protect against the illusion’s influence. Let’s pose as passing cultivators and first probe the details of Black Wind Stronghold.”
The two swallowed the Mind-Clearing Pills and stepped into the misty forest.
The fog wrapped around them like cold silk, with visibility less than three feet. Faint whispers echoed in their ears, as if countless eyes were watching from the shadows.
Hu Mazi tightly clutched the clan leader’s token, its white light dispelling the surrounding fog, giving him some reassurance.
“The demonic energy in this forest is mixed, not from a single demon cultivator. It seems Black Wind Stronghold has gathered quite a few demons.”
Chen Ping quietly extended his spiritual sense, but the demonic energy in the fog interfered, limiting his detection to a ten-zhang radius.
“Be careful, the illusions here can affect your spiritual sense. Don’t get bewitched.”
After walking for about half an hour, a fork in the path appeared ahead. At the junction stood a stone tablet inscribed with the words “Black Wind Stronghold,” the crooked characters exuding a ferocious aura.
“This way.”
Chen Ping pointed to the left path, where the demonic energy was denser, clearly leading to the stronghold.
As they turned onto the left path, the sound of hoofbeats suddenly echoed through the fog. A dozen demon cultivators riding black wolves appeared ahead, blocking their way.
These demon cultivators had grotesque appearances, wielding knives and axes, their eyes glinting with greed.
“This road is ours, these trees are ours. If you want to pass, leave your toll!”
The leader, a burly man with a wolf’s head, held a massive mountain-cleaving axe, glaring fiercely at Chen Ping and Hu Mazi.
Hu Mazi was about to act, but Chen Ping held him back.
Chen Ping took out a small piece of immortal stone from his robe and tossed it to the wolf-headed man, “We’re just passing cultivators, hoping to rest at your place for a night. This is a small token of goodwill.”
The wolf-headed man caught the immortal stone, weighed it, and sneered, “Just this bit of immortal stone? Think you’re dealing with beggars? Hand over all the treasures you’ve got, or don’t blame your grandpa for being unkind!”
The demon cultivators behind him jeered, brandishing their weapons, and the atmosphere grew tense.
A cold glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes, but he suppressed the urge to act, “We’re just rogue cultivators with no treasures. Please let us pass.”
“Rogue cultivators?”
The wolf-headed man sized them up, his gaze landing on the clan leader’s token in Hu Mazi’s hand, a greedy spark in his eyes, “That jade pendant in the kid’s hand looks nice. Hand it over, and your grandpa will let you pass!”
Hu Mazi’s face darkened, gripping the token tightly, “This is my family heirloom. I’ll never give it up!”
“You refuse the toast, you’ll take the punishment!”
The wolf-headed man roared, swinging his mountain-cleaving axe at Hu Mazi, “Take it!”
The dozen demon cultivators charged, their knives and axes slashing towards the pair.
Chen Ping didn’t hesitate any longer. His spiritual energy surged, enveloping them in a faint golden shield.
At the same time, he summoned the Dragon-Slaying Sword. Golden sword energy swept out, instantly sending the foremost demon cultivators flying.
The wolf-headed man hadn’t expected Chen Ping to be such a tough opponent. Startled, he quickly reacted, roaring as he swung his axe with fierce wind towards Chen Ping’s shield.
