“A prisoner has escaped from the heavenly prison, a female human cultivator. All soldiers, prepare for battle immediately.”
An anxious voice rang out in the air.
“Damn it, trying to work us to death!”
The soldiers who had removed their armour hurriedly put it back on, then rushed nervously through the city.
Chen Ping and his three companions also took advantage of the chaos to move through the city.
Originally, Chen Ping had planned to visit the small mountain city, but now that he knew it was home to Huo Zhao, the Eighth Hall Master of the Temple, he decided against stirring trouble.
Now, they could only find another way to leave Flying Tiger City without alerting Huo Zhao.
“Let’s seize the chance to find a place to hide. This armour is too stifling!”
Chen Ping said.
“Alright, let’s find a hiding spot first.”
Mad Immortal agreed.
The four found a secluded place, intending to remove their heavy armour.
But just as they were about to take it off, a sharp sword beam suddenly struck.
The unexpected attack startled all four of them.
With a thought, Chen Ping summoned his Dragon-Slaying Sword, instantly blocking the sword beam.
Only then did the four notice a black-robed woman hiding in the area, gripping a long sword and glaring at them.
Judging by her aura, she was a First-Grade Loose Immortal, exuding the presence of a human cultivator.
It seemed the escaped prisoner was likely this woman.
After her strike was blocked, the woman launched another attack on Chen Ping and his group.
However, she didn’t unleash her full aura, keeping it restrained, likely fearing that emitting too much would draw more attention.
Seeing the woman’s cautious approach, Chen Ping smirked coldly, charging forward without dodging or flinching, letting her sword strike his armour directly.
The soldiers’ armour was incredibly tough, and with Chen Ping’s robust physique, even if the armour broke, he had nothing to fear!
Chen Ping advanced, grabbing the woman’s wrist and, with a twist, made her drop her sword.
He subdued her effortlessly.
“Beasts, you filthy beasts, you’ll meet a wretched end!”
The woman struggled fiercely, shouting loudly.
“Quiet down, or the four of us will have our way with you…”
Chen Ping intimidated her.
The woman, hearing this, indeed showed fear and shut her mouth.
Bai Yi, however, flushed and said, “Son-in-law, don’t talk nonsense. Given our status, we can’t just toy with a woman.”
“Father-in-law, I was just scaring her. Why are you taking it seriously?”
Chen Ping was speechless.
It seemed Bai Yi was actually tempted!
The woman, hearing them call each other son-in-law and father-in-law, was utterly bewildered.
At this point, Chen Ping removed his helmet, revealing his face, and sent a trace of human aura into the woman’s body.
Sensing Chen Ping’s human aura, the woman’s eyes widened in disbelief.
“You… you…”
The woman stared at Chen Ping, momentarily at a loss for words.
“We’re not Flying Tiger City’s soldiers. We sneaked in too and are now trying to escape.”
Chen Ping explained to the stunned woman.
Hearing this, the woman relaxed, and the hostility on her face vanished instantly.
“Big brother, we can barely save ourselves. Why bother with her?”
Mad Immortal said to Chen Ping.
“Shut up. Are you the big brother, or am I?” Chen Ping retorted coldly.
“You’re the big brother, I’ll follow your lead!” Mad Immortal quickly replied.
“Miss, who are you, and how did you end up captured by Flying Tiger City?”
Chen Ping asked the woman.
Since she was at the Loose Immortal realm, she couldn’t have been someone recently brought by the Great Dao.
