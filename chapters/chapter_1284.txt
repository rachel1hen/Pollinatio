As the blood-red hue on Chen Ping’s body gradually faded, Ning Dahai couldn’t have been more delighted.
Soon, Chen Ping would succumb to the poison, and he wanted everyone to witness this moment!
Golden light began to shimmer faintly on Chen Ping’s body, the blood poison completely absorbed.
“This blood poison of yours, it’s really quite something…”
Chen Ping’s eyes gleamed with greed, his aura erupting explosively.
This left Ning Dahai stunned, everyone was stunned!
No one could understand what was happening, they had clearly seen the blood poison invade Chen Ping’s body, how could he be completely unaffected?
Meanwhile, the aura within Chen Ping’s body surged even more violently.
“You… you’re not afraid of blood poison?”
Ning Dahai stared at Chen Ping in utter shock.
Chen Ping gave a cold smile, “I forgot to tell you, I’m the master of the Medicine God Valley, do you think I’d be afraid of your so-called blood poison?”
Chen Ping’s words left Ning Dahai dumbfounded.
Ning Dahai was unaware of Chen Ping’s connection to the Medicine God Valley.
Ning Dahai didn’t know, but some others did, after all, the Medicine God Valley had always followed Chen Ping’s orders!
“We forgot about Chen Ping’s identity as the master of the Medicine God Valley, what kind of place is the Medicine God Valley, how could they fear poison!”
“This is like brandishing a sword in front of Guan Gong, he’s done for…”
“This Chen Ping, who knows how many identities he has.”
The crowd whispered among themselves.
But no one knew that Chen Ping’s immunity to the blood poison had nothing to do with his title as the master of the Medicine God Valley.
Chen Ping simply didn’t want others to know the secret of his Heart Condensation Technique.
Ning Dahai’s face darkened, he knew today’s matter wouldn’t be easy to resolve.
If even blood poison couldn’t affect Chen Ping, it seemed a desperate fight was inevitable!
“Got any other tricks?”
Chen Ping clenched his fist, golden light flickering on it.
A golden dragon coiled around Chen Ping’s arm, the power of the divine dragon pushed to its limit.
“Holy Light Fist…”
Chen Ping let out a furious roar, then threw a punch.
The golden dragon emitted a dragon’s roar, charging straight at Ning Dahai.
A fierce wind whipped up across the ground, endless terrifying spiritual energy like countless sharp blades, instantly enveloping Ning Dahai’s entire body.
Panic flashed in Ning Dahai’s eyes, his inner energy surging outward, forming a protective shield around his body!
Clanging sounds rang out incessantly!
Ning Dahai gritted his teeth, resisting with all his might.
But suddenly, an immense force slammed into Ning Dahai’s chest, sending his body flying backward.
Boom…
Ning Dahai crashed heavily into the ground, instantly creating a deep crater.
Everyone looked at Chen Ping in horror, their faces filled with disbelief, this punch, just one punch, had unleashed such astonishing power!
“Dad…”
“Master…”
Ning Zhi and the Ning family rushed over, helping Ning Dahai to his feet.
Blood trickled from Ning Dahai’s mouth, his face deathly pale.
“Get out of the way…”
Ning Dahai’s anger was forced out, shoving Ning Zhi aside.
Taking two steps forward, Ning Dahai glared at Chen Ping, then took a deep breath and slammed his palm hard against his own chest.
Immediately, a mouthful of blood sprayed from Ning Dahai’s mouth.
Ning Dahai quickly waved his hands in the air, as if casting some spell!
In an instant, terrifying auras rose, the blood Ning Dahai had spat out turning into clouds of blood mist.
Then, with a sudden gulp, Ning Dahai sucked the blood mist back into his body!
“Chen Ping, you’ve forced me, I’ll fight you to the death…”
Ning Dahai’s eyes blazed with fury, his body beginning to swell!
Soon, Ning Dahai’s body turned blood-red, resembling a blood-soaked figure.
