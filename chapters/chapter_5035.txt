The maid beside her tried to wipe the cold sweat from her forehead but was flung back by an invisible force, turning into a mist of blood in mid-air.
“Everyone, hold steady!”
Lan Lianhua’s clear shout pierced the grim battlefield. Her jade hands danced, and thirty-six azure lotus phantoms bloomed behind her, each radiating a purifying glow against the demonic aura.
Even so, a trace of gravity lingered in her eyes—the azure lotus phantoms were visibly dimming under the black mist’s corrosion.
“Roar—”
A bone-chilling sound of grinding bones suddenly erupted from the black mist, and countless skeleton soldiers surged forth like a tide.
These skeleton soldiers had eerie green ghostfire flickering in their eye sockets, their bones wrapped in strange black runes. Even when shattered, they quickly reassembled, impossible to kill!
“Damn it! Why won’t these skeleton soldiers die?”
Hu Mazi smashed the skulls of three skeleton soldiers with a single punch, only to see the broken bones reassemble in the black mist, standing again in an instant.
Chen Ping’s brows furrowed as he swept his Dragon-Slaying Sword, shattering dozens of skeleton soldiers.
But moments later, the broken bones eerily reassembled.
“These skeleton soldiers are under an undead curse!” He suddenly recalled that the best way to deal with them was supreme fire. “Only supreme fire can destroy them completely!”
“Little Fire Qilin!”
With Chen Ping’s low shout, a dazzling crimson light burst from his shoulder.
A small qilin, its body red and scales burning like flames, leaped from his storage ring, letting out a deafening roar.
“Roar—”
The little fire qilin grew in the wind, transforming into a ten-zhang-tall flaming beast in an instant.
Where its four hooves tread, the ground erupted in blazing flames. The skeleton soldiers, upon touching the fire, let out shrill screams as the black runes on their bones sizzled and burned, turning to ash.
“Well done!”
Seeing this, Mo Qingyun immediately directed the cultivators to form battle formations, luring the skeleton soldiers into the fire qilin’s flame range.
However, just as the battle showed slight improvement, a heart-palpitating fluctuation came from the depths of the black mist.
Twelve hundred-zhang-tall bone puppets emerged slowly from the fog, each constructed from the bones of countless cultivators, their hollow eye sockets flickering with green ghostfire.
The ground beneath the bone puppets rotted inch by inch, sprouting dense blood-red mushrooms. The mucus dripping from their caps corroded the earth into bottomless pits.
“The Bone-Eroding King’s undead soldiers!” A terrified scream erupted from the crowd.
Ashinu roared, his battle axe unleashing a golden gust that struck a bone puppet’s arm, leaving only a white scratch on the bone.
More bone puppets raised their bone blades, the edges coated with dark purple demonic poison. Before the blades even reached, the skin of the frontline cultivators began to rot.
Cangxuan Continent’s defence line fell into chaos, with cultivators fighting individually, their once-orderly formation scattered.
Mo Qingyun’s sword conjured layers of frost, freezing the lower halves of three bone puppets, but in moments, they shattered the ice, sprouting new bone spikes from their severed legs.
“This can’t go on!”
Chen Ping, watching the shrinking defence line, felt a chill in his heart.
He suddenly noticed that, though slow, the bone puppets moved in a pattern. After observing closely, his pupils contracted—these bone puppets were forming an ancient demonic array!
At the array’s centre, the black mist condensed into a giant human face, none other than the Bone-Eroding King’s decayed, pustule-covered visage: “Cangxuan ants, today is your doom! Demon Bone Devouring Heaven Array, activate!”
In an instant, the twelve bone puppets let out earth-shaking roars, their bone blades weaving a sky-blocking net of blades.
The blood mushrooms on the ground exploded, releasing a suffocating poisonous mist.
