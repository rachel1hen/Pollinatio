Upon receiving the news, Huo Zhao immediately led the forces of the Eight Halls towards the main city of Flying Tiger City!
The Patrol Envoy had already left to reconstruct his physical body!
When Huo Zhao and his army arrived, they were met with the sight of the Demon Dragon Hall’s forces bearing down.
His rage flared, and he roared, “With my Divine Hall here, the Demon Dragon Hall will not set foot in Flying Tiger City!”
The Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord, seeing Huo Zhao’s sudden appearance, furrowed his brows.
“You’re from the Divine Hall?” the Dragon Lord asked.
“Indeed, I am the Lord of the Eight Halls,” Huo Zhao nodded. “Flying Tiger City has already been claimed by my Eight Halls, if your Demon Dragon Hall wants territory, pick somewhere else.”
“I reckon Rhino City would do nicely, it’s all show and no substance now, a little effort and you could take it!”
Huo Zhao was actually suggesting the Demon Dragon Hall seize Rhino City!
Had the Dragon Lord not met Chen Ping and learned his identity, he might have considered taking both Flying Tiger City and Rhino City!
“This First Heaven is a battleground for our three races, your Divine Clan always claims to be a fourth race, so why compete with us for territory?”
“A beast clan city, and your Divine Hall has its eye on it?”
The Dragon Lord tried flattery to make Huo Zhao back down.
“Less talk, either leave or fight.”
Huo Zhao snorted coldly.
The Divine Clan’s inherent arrogance wouldn’t allow an Eight Halls Lord like him to grovel before the Demon Clan!
“Damn it, let’s fight then, who’s scared of who!”
The Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord roared.
Battle erupted instantly.
The Eight Halls’ cultivators formed arrays to meet the enemy, talismans, flying swords, and magical treasures lighting up half the sky.
The Demon Dragon Hall’s bone dragons let out earth-shaking roars, countless skeleton soldiers surging from the mist sea, both sides clashing fiercely above Flying Tiger City.
“The Demon Dragon Hall’s tangling with the Divine Hall’s people!”
Mad Immortal gazed towards Flying Tiger City’s main city, grinning as if watching a spectacle.
“Let them fight like dogs, biting each other’s fur…” Hu Mazi chuckled.
But Gadfly looked worried, his eyes filled with panic.
“What’s wrong?” Chen Ping asked, turning to Gadfly.
“Big Brother, I’m afraid the Demon Dragon Hall’s no match for the Divine Hall, if they retreat, Flying Tiger City will still fall to the Divine Hall, and then my Rhino City’s in danger.”
“It won’t take long for the Eight Halls to recover and come for revenge with Flying Tiger City, and I won’t have the strength to resist.”
Gadfly said anxiously.
Though Flying Tiger City was weakened, Rhino City was in no better shape!
In time, Huo Zhao would surely seek vengeance!
“You’re right, we can’t let the Divine Hall win!” Chen Ping nodded.
“We’re already exhausted, how can we help the Demon Dragon Hall now?”
The white-robed woman said.
They’d fought Flying Tiger City and the Eight Halls, then the Demon Dragon Hall without rest, everyone was at their limit!
“I’ve got an idea!” Chen Ping’s eyes lit up. “Gadfly, bring Huo Shizi here, whether we can make Huo Zhao retreat depends on how much his son means to him!”
Gadfly hurried off and brought Huo Shizi.
With that, Chen Ping and the others escorted Huo Shizi straight to Flying Tiger City’s main city!
At that moment, the Eight Halls and the Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord were locked in a fierce struggle!
But the Dragon Lord grew increasingly uneasy, knowing Huo Zhao, an Eight Halls Lord, was just a minor figure in the Divine Hall!
The Eight Halls weren’t even significant within the Divine Hall!
And the Divine Hall itself wasn’t the greatest power in the Divine Clan!
If they provoked the Divine Hall over a single city, the Demon Dragon Hall might be in grave danger!
