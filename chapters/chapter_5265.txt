Nan Batian gave a bitter smile. “I know… but after all these years, with her like this now, can we ever go back to how things were?”
Chen Ping looked at him earnestly. “The past may be gone, but the future isn’t set. Avoiding it won’t solve anything. And the Fat Lady’s condition, it might not be beyond saving.”
Nan Batian’s head snapped up, a glimmer of hope in his eyes. “What did you say? Mr. Chen, you have a way?”
Chen Ping scratched his head. “I can’t make promises, but I can try.
I once read in an ancient text about similar cases, some bodily changes from forbidden techniques aren’t entirely irreversible.
The key is identifying the technique’s source, understanding its energy flow, and pairing it with the right medicines and methods to neutralise the side effects.”
He paused, then said, “Could I speak with the Fat Lady? I’d like to learn more about that forbidden technique.”
Nan Batian hesitated, then nodded. “Alright… thank you, Mr. Chen.”
He knew this might be A’Cui’s only chance, and his opportunity to make amends.
Soon after, the Fat Lady finished her arrangements and approached cheerfully, tugging at Nan Batian to head to the banquet.
“Batian, come on, I’ve had fine wine and food prepared. Let’s catch up! I’ve got so much to say after all these years!”
Nan Batian glanced at Chen Ping, who gave him a subtle nod.
Taking a deep breath, Nan Batian said to the Fat Lady, “A’Cui… I need to talk to you. And Mr. Chen, he thinks he might… be able to help you.”
Hearing the long-forgotten name “A’Cui,” the Fat Lady froze, tears welling in her eyes.
She stared at Nan Batian, then at Chen Ping, her voice trembling. “Help me? Help me with what?”
Chen Ping stepped forward, sincerely saying, “Fat Lady, I want to see if I can find a way to undo the side effects of that forbidden technique, to restore your body to its original state.”
The Fat Lady was stunned, then burst into laughter, though it was laced with bitterness and self-mockery.
“Restore my body? Young brother, don’t tease me. Over the years, I’ve seen countless renowned healers, tried every method, all for nothing. This technique’s side effects are irreversible. I’ve accepted my fate.”
“I know it’s difficult,” Chen Ping said firmly, “but how can we know without trying? Fat Lady, don’t you want to return to your old self? To start anew with Nan Batian as your true self?”
His words were like a key, unlocking a long-buried desire in the Fat Lady’s heart.
Her laughter stopped abruptly. She gazed at Nan Batian, her eyes filled with longing and disbelief.
Of course she wanted it. Countless nights, she’d dreamt of being that delicate A’Cui again, nestled by Brother Batian’s side.
But each time she woke to her bloated body, all she felt was endless despair.
“Is there… really hope?”
Her voice was barely a whisper, tinged with faint expectation.
“I’d say there’s a seventy percent chance,” Chen Ping replied, offering a conservative estimate based on the ancient texts and his own judgment. “But I need you to tell me everything about that forbidden technique, the incantations, the energy paths, how it felt when you practised it, and the changes in your body.”
The Fat Lady hesitated for a long time, glancing at Nan Batian’s encouraging look and recalling the pain and insecurity she’d endured for years. Finally, she gritted her teeth. “Fine! I’ll tell you! If there’s even a sliver of hope, I’m willing to try! Even if… even if it fails, I’ll accept it!”
