As Chen Ping’s words fell, a ball of flame shot out from his storage ring. Before anyone could make it out, the flame charged straight at the dozens of spirit beasts!
The once-ferocious spirit beasts, upon seeing the flame, froze in terror, turned tail, and bolted!
No matter how the Spirit Sect disciples called out, the beasts ignored them, scrambling desperately to escape!
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…
The flame chased after them at blinding speed. In the blink of an eye, all dozens of spirit beasts dropped dead, crashing to the ground like dumplings into a pot!
When the flame returned to Chen Ping’s side, everyone finally saw it was a qilin beast!
A fire qilin, a true divine beast!
Countless times stronger than those spirit beasts!
Though this fire qilin was just a cub, dealing with these spirit beasts was a breeze!
“A divine beast?” The Spirit Sect crowd was utterly dumbfounded!
For thousands of years, they’d bred spirit beasts across generations, but they’d never seen a divine beast!
The Spirit Sect Master’s eyes widened, his body trembling like it was hooked to a motor!
Chen Ping looked up at the Spirit Sect disciples and swung his Dragon-Slaying Sword!
Boom!
Suddenly, ten thousand sword beams sliced towards them, blotting out the sky and dimming the earth!
The Spirit Sect disciples didn’t dare slack off, throwing everything they had into defence!
Over a dozen of them pooled their strength, forming a massive shield!
The moment the sword beams hit the shield, it shattered. All dozen-plus disciples were pierced through by the beams, turning to dust in a flash of white light and vanishing!
One strike, and over a dozen Spirit Sect disciples were gone!
This single blow left everyone in absolute shock!
These weren’t just any disciples, they were the Spirit Sect’s elite, including some at the Immortal Transformation Realm!
And now, they were all gone!
“No…”
The Spirit Sect Master roared in anguish!
These were his sect’s finest, yet Chen Ping had slaughtered them all.
Like a madman, the Spirit Sect Master’s eyes turned bloodshot as he charged furiously at Chen Ping!
The Spirit Sect specialised in raising spirit beasts, not raw strength, so going toe-to-toe with Chen Ping like this was a losing battle!
But he wasn’t thinking straight anymore, all he wanted was to kill Chen Ping!
“Overestimating yourself…”
Chen Ping snorted coldly, put away his Dragon-Slaying Sword, and charged right back at the Spirit Sect Master!
Bang, bang, bang…
Their bodies clashed violently, unleashing a string of explosive booms!
The commotion had long drawn a crowd of Dao Sect cultivators, watching from the air. A showdown between the three sects and Chen Ping for revenge? No one wanted to miss this spectacle!
But when they saw Chen Ping, a mere third-rank Transcendence Realm cultivator, trading blows with the Spirit Sect Master using sheer physical strength, they were floored!
Sure, a genius could fight above their level, but that usually relied on superior techniques or divine weapons!
To clash purely with physical might, without techniques or weapons, how could a third-rank Transcendence Realm cultivator match the Spirit Sect Master?
Yet, before their eyes, every collision with the Spirit Sect Master drew a roar from Chen Ping!
His fighting spirit surged higher, while the Spirit Sect Master’s body was already battered and breaking, barely holding on!
Meanwhile, Young Master Ming, seated in the tavern, slowly lifted his head to glance out the window!
It was the first time he’d looked outside since the fight began!
To him, this brawl was no different from kids playing house!
