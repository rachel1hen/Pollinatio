Chen Ping was stunned for a moment before quickly changing his tone, grinning at the little Heaven-Devouring Beast: “Brother Heaven-Devourer, please help out and swallow all these demons!”
To everyone’s surprise, at Chen Ping’s words, the little Heaven-Devouring Beast actually opened its massive mouth, capable of swallowing mountains, and sucked fiercely at the sky full of skeleton soldiers!
“Whoosh—”
A terrifying suction formed a black whirlwind, pulling tens of thousands of skeleton soldiers into it.
They had no chance to struggle before being swallowed into the beast’s bottomless maw.
Even more shocking, the undead curse on the skeleton soldiers dissolved completely in the Heaven-Devouring Beast’s stomach, unable to reassemble.
With the fire qilin and Heaven-Devouring Beast joining the fray, the battle turned in an instant.
The little fire qilin regained its vigor, its flames burning brightly again, forming a seamless partnership with the Heaven-Devouring Beast.
The fire qilin incinerated the demonic soldiers on the ground, while the Heaven-Devouring Beast devoured the skeleton army in the air.
“The time for a counterattack has come!” Chen Ping, enduring searing pain, raised his Dragon-Slaying Sword. “Follow me and kill!”
“Kill!”
With Chen Ping’s roar, the cultivators of Cangxuan Continent reignited their fighting spirit.
They formed new battle formations, engaging the demonic soldiers in a desperate struggle.
In the sky, sword aura clashed with demonic energy, the glow of treasures dancing with blood rain.
Chen Ping wove through the crowd, each swing of his sword claiming the lives of several demonic soldiers.
His clothes were soaked in blood, yet his gaze grew sharper, like a war god returned from hell.
The brutal battle raged for three days and three nights.
When the last demonic soldier fell, the sunrise finally pierced the dark clouds, casting golden light on the ravaged land.
Cangxuan Continent had been saved once again!
Lan Lianhua was immensely grateful to Chen Ping. Without him, Cangxuan Continent would have surely fallen long ago!
It would have been doomed during the Eighth Hall’s attack.
“Friend Chen, thank you so much. It’s just a pity that our Cangxuan Continent has no remarkable resources to offer.”
Lan Lianhua, seeing Chen Ping’s weakened state, said with embarrassment.
“It was nothing, just a small effort. My body will recover after a few days of rest!”
Chen Ping smiled faintly.
With the Demon-Suppressing Tower, Chen Ping only needed to cultivate inside it for a few hours to recover quickly.
After settling everything, Chen Ping took Hu Mazi into the Demon-Suppressing Tower.
This time, Hu Mazi was also heavily drained.
After a day in the Demon-Suppressing Tower, both emerged full of energy, fully restored!
When Lan Lianhua saw Chen Ping, she was stunned!
Mo Qingyun, however, wasn’t surprised. Having been in Chen Ping’s Demon-Suppressing Tower, she knew its power.
“Friend Chen, you… you recovered completely in just one day? That’s incredible.”
Lan Lianhua’s eyes were full of disbelief.
Chen Ping only smiled lightly and asked, “Mysterious Lady, may I ask, where did the floating island of Cangxuan Continent come from?”
Lan Lianhua shook her head: “I don’t know. When I took charge of Cangxuan Continent, the floating island was already there. It’s been there for countless years, and no one remembers how long.”
“Does Friend Chen like the floating island’s environment? You can stay there as long as you like. You’re the benefactor of Cangxuan Continent, and no one would object to you living there forever.”
“No, no, I’m just curious, not planning to live there,” Chen Ping waved his hands hurriedly.
He only wanted to investigate the floating island. If it truly was a relic of an ancient civilization, it could be a fortune!
But it seemed Cangxuan Continent didn’t know the island was a relic. For now, Chen Ping’s suspicion, backed by the Red Cloud Demon Lord’s claim, needed further exploration to confirm.
At that moment, a cultivator rushed over and said to Lan Lianhua, “Mysterious Lady, that Huo Jingjing is refusing to eat. She’s going on a hunger strike…”
