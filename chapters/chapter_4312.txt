Chen Ping did not hold back this time, but wanted to see just how far his True Fire Dharma Body had reached.
The terrifying aura of flames wrapped Chen Ping’s entire body, and the crowd could only see the huge True Fire Dharma Body, no longer seeing Chen Ping’s figure!
“Heavens, is this still the power that a Ferrying Realm cultivator can erupt?”
“Monster, this Chen Ping is a complete monster ah ……”
“A spectacle, what a spectacle, a first grade cultivator of the Mahayana realm was actually injured by the Transition realm and was still powerless?”
The crowd looked at Chen Ping in front of them with a shocked expression, they had never expected this outcome!
Originally, they all thought that Mu Qing could have put Chen Ping down in three punches and two kicks!
But now it seemed that the result was completely the opposite!
Tan Rongkun’s face had become incapable of being ugly, he would never have thought that Chen Ping had such a strong strength!
Although he also knew that the Demon Sealing Alliance had used a hundred years of offerings to hunt down Chen Ping, but that didn’t mean that Chen Ping, a Transition Realm, had displayed strength that exceeded the Mahayana Realm ah!
Mu Qing gritted his teeth, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and slowly merged into the dharma body behind him, and the longsword in his hand was instantly gripped in that dharma body’s hand, while the body of the sword also increased in size by hundreds of times!
The huge blood sword, chopped towards Chen Ping, this time the sword aura was obviously much brighter!
The power contained within the sword awnings caused the great dao to roar with a destructive momentum, and although it was not fast, it broke all laws with force!
Rumbling …………
Chen Ping’s True Fire Dharma Body, also slapped out a sheet in the same trend, a fire dragon appeared and instantly crushed that sword mane, while Chen Ping’s footsteps didn’t move the slightest bit!
“Ah …………”
Mu Qing was going crazy, the longsword in his hand kept waving, a sword mane falling towards Chen Ping like rain!
At this moment, Mu Qing’s expression was twisted and his body was covered in a tyrannical killing aura!
“You are not my opponent, you have not knelt down and admitted defeat, now that ten moves have passed, watch me take your head!”
Chen Ping finished speaking and violently rushed out from the flames, followed by a smooth swing of the Dragon Cutting Sword in his hand!
Boom!
With just this sword, the air swallowed mountains and rivers, stirring up ten thousand feet of sword awnings!
The Dharma body that was like a mountain, but at this moment, slowly disappeared under Chen Ping’s sword!
Mu Qing’s body appeared, but his eyes were already wide open, his face full of shock!
The blood-coloured longsword in his hand had also instantly turned into blood mist and disappeared, and from that Mu Qing’s neck, a blood-red thin line appeared!
Boom!
Mu Qing opened his mouth, but before he had the chance to speak, his head directly fell above the ring, followed by his body falling heavily!
A spirit light flashed out from within Mu Qing’s body, only to be struck by Chen Ping with a bolt of supreme fire that instantly wrapped that spirit light!
“Ah …………”
A mournful scream rang out, it was Mu Qing’s divine soul!
He had wanted to escape his physical body, and as long as he left behind a wisp of his residual soul, there was still hope that he could remake his physical body and come back to life.
But who knew that Chen Ping would not even spare his divine soul, obviously wanting to cure him to death, no mercy at all anymore!
“Stop ……”
Seeing this, Chief Steward Liu instantly burst into a rage, his killing intent instantly surging out!
The others were also shocked, no one was paying attention, Mu Qing was actually killed, and even the remnants of his soul were not spared!
Chief Liu rushed towards the ring, but he bumped into the formations around the ring, and his body was instantly blocked back!
Tan Rongkun’s entire body froze on the spot, he hadn’t even reacted at this point.
He had never thought that Mu Qing would die so quickly!
This was a Mahayana Realm First Grade expert, how could he die like this?
Even if he was outmatched, he shouldn’t have been killed so easily?
