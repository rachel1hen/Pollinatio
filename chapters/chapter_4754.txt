Seeing this, Zuo Tianzheng struggled to his feet, silently took out his storage bag, and tossed it at Chen Ping’s feet!
It seemed he was hoping Chen Ping would spare him too.
Looking at the pile of storage bags on the ground, Chen Ping waved his hand and said, “Get out of here…”
“Thank you, Mr. Chen, for sparing our lives…”
The elder and the other Demon-Sealing Alliance cultivators repeatedly expressed their gratitude before turning and fleeing.
Zuo Tianzheng, without a word, also turned to leave.
“Did I say you could go?” Chen Ping said coldly.
Zuo Tianzheng forced a smile. “Brother Chen, Mr. Chen, Master Chen, please spare me. I swear I won’t be the leader of the Demon-Sealing Alliance anymore, nor will I serve as the Ten Halls’ lackey.”
“From now on, I’ll find a quiet place to cultivate in peace and never commit any evil deeds again. Please, spare me.”
The once-mighty leader of the Demon-Sealing Alliance now groveled like a beggar before Chen Ping.
The villagers of Dashicun, having grown accustomed to such scenes, no longer felt the initial shock.
“Don’t be nervous. I didn’t say I was going to kill you. But I need you to take me to the Ten Halls,” Chen Ping said.
“No, no! The Demon-Sealing Alliance is finished. I want to run as far away as possible. Going to the Ten Halls would be suicide!” Zuo Tianzheng waved his hands frantically.
“If you don’t take me, you’ll die right now,” Chen Ping said with a cold smile.
Zuo Tianzheng shuddered and finally nodded. “Alright, I’ll take you…”
Chen Ping left the storage bags from the Demon-Sealing Alliance to the villagers of Dashicun. He gently patted Yun’er and Zhu Zi on the head and said, “Focus on your cultivation. These resources will be enough for Dashicun for a long time.”
“If I get the chance, I’ll come back to visit you…”
“Brother Chen, don’t worry. Wait for us in the Heavenly Realm. We’ll definitely ascend there,” Zhu Zi said with confidence.
“Alright, I’ll wait for you in the Heavenly Realm!” Chen Ping smiled.
Zhu Zi, being young, had no idea how arduous the path of cultivation could be. Ascending to the Heavenly Realm was an incredibly difficult feat.
Even large sects and clans, despite exhausting all their resources, might not be able to produce a single cultivator capable of ascending to the Heavenly Realm.
With the resources Dashicun had, dreaming of ascending to the Heavenly Realm was nothing short of a fantasy.
But Chen Ping didn’t want to crush their confidence. With determination, people could achieve things much faster.
After bidding farewell to the villagers of Dashicun, Chen Ping, along with Xuan Bin and the others, followed Zuo Tianzheng to the headquarters of the Demon-Sealing Alliance.
To enter the Ten Halls, they had to pass through a secret chamber in the alliance’s headquarters.

**The Ten Halls**
The Lord of the Ten Halls sat on his throne in the grand hall, his eyes closed as if deep in thought.
Behind him stood a black-faced cultivator with a long beard, his eyes wide like bells, his hands resting on his hips, exuding an aura of divine authority.
On either side of the hall stood ten powerful figures clad in black robes and helmets. Their auras were so restrained that they seemed almost invisible.
“Father, I heard the Demon-Sealing Alliance has been destroyed. That was a force we painstakingly built to conquer the Heavenly Realm. Who would dare oppose the Ten Halls so brazenly?”
The Tenth Prince, his injuries mostly healed, hurried into the hall to ask.
“Don’t concern yourself with this. Go back and continue your recovery. From now on, you need not involve yourself in the affairs of the Ten Halls,” the Lord of the Ten Halls said, waving his hand.
“Father, the Ten Halls are in crisis. How can I stand by and do nothing?” the Tenth Prince insisted, refusing to leave.
*Buzz!*
Just as the Tenth Prince finished speaking, the sharp sound of a sword echoed through the hall. In the next moment, the massive doors of the hall were cleanly split in two.
*Boom!*
The doors collapsed, and Chen Ping, followed by Xuan Bin and the others, strode calmly into the hall.
