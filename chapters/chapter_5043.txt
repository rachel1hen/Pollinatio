“Such peculiar runes…”
Chen Ping stepped forward, gently touching the stone door, but it showed no reaction.
Suddenly, the man in white, holding a folding fan, leapt high and swung it forcefully.
Boom!
A massive force surged towards the stone door, an attempt to break it open by brute strength, as none of them understood formations or the runes on the door.
In such cases, brute force was the way to go.
But the moment that terrifying force touched the door, the man in white’s face changed, and he was instantly thrown back by a tremendous recoil!
The ground trembled, and blood slowly trickled from the corner of his mouth.
“Serves him right…” the man in green muttered with a smirk.
Chen Ping stared at the stone door in disbelief, stunned by the immense power of the formation on it.
To think it could withstand a strike from a fifth-grade Loose Immortal and even injure him.
The man in white, now grim-faced, approached the door again, this time refraining from acting rashly.
“Can you break the formation on the door?” Mo Qingyun asked Chen Ping.
In her eyes, Chen Ping was capable of anything.
“Of course. There’s no formation in this world I can’t break,” Chen Ping said with a confident smile.
“Showing off…” The man in white glanced at him.
Clearly, the proud man in white, having been repelled and injured by the door, felt his pride stung by Chen Ping’s words.
Chen Ping smirked coldly and was about to start breaking the formation when a terrifying aura suddenly washed over them.
A massive firebird slowly tore through the void!
Its appearance startled everyone.
Perched atop the firebird stood a man in splendid attire, his makeup strikingly flamboyant, giving him an androgynous appearance.
Beside him, a woman in lingerie knelt at his feet.
Chen Ping stared at the firebird in astonishment, its size overwhelming, dwarfing his own fire qilin by countless times.
“The hidden prodigy of Tianyuan Pavilion, Tianci?” the man in green gasped, his breathing quickening.
Mo Qingyun frowned, her expression turning peculiar, and she quietly moved to stand behind Chen Ping.
The firebird descended slowly, its blazing flames warping the surrounding air.
Tianci gently stroked the hair of the woman beside him, his gaze sweeping over the crowd before settling on Mo Qingyun, who hid behind Chen Ping, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.
“Sister Qingyun, what are you doing here?” Tianci’s voice carried a soft, almost effeminate tone. “I heard you went to the First Heaven. I was planning to look for you there.”
The man in green hurriedly bowed in respect. “Young Master Tianci, your reputation precedes you!”
Tianci didn’t spare him a glance, merely waving a hand to dismiss him.
The man in white stood coldly in place, offering no bow, his eyes betraying a hint of disdain.
Tianci’s gaze shifted to him, his brow slightly raised. “What, you don’t know who I am?”
The man in white replied coolly, “What if I do?”
“Ha…”
Tianci let out a soft chuckle, then abruptly raised his hand, a glint of cold light flashing from his fingertip.
“Pfft!”
A hole pierced through the white-robed man’s forehead, blood gushing out. He collapsed without even a chance to react.
A fifth-grade Loose Immortal, killed instantly by a third-grade Loose Immortal!
Chen Ping’s pupils contracted, his heart reeling with shock. “This guy’s strength… far exceeds his realm!”
The man in green broke out in a cold sweat, relieved he had greeted Tianci earlier.
Tianci withdrew his hand, as if he had merely crushed an ant. “Acting tough in front of me is just asking for death.”
His gaze then turned to Chen Ping. “And you? Don’t know me either?”
