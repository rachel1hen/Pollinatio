“You… how did you come back?”
Hu Mazi retreated in fear, tightly clutching the clan leader’s token in his hand.
“You think he could distract me?” Fairy Chi Lian sneered, “A mere cultivator of the Loose Immortal Realm dares to show off in front of me.”
Her gaze fell on the clan leader’s token in Hu Mazi’s hand, a flicker of surprise in her eyes: “This token… you’re from the Hu Clan?”
Hu Mazi’s heart sank. He hadn’t expected Fairy Chi Lian to recognise the clan leader’s token, suggesting she was also connected to the clan’s annihilation years ago.
“So what if I am?”
Hu Mazi forced himself to stay calm, saying, “I’m here today to avenge my Hu Clan!”
“Avenge? With your strength?”
Fairy Chi Lian laughed coldly, “Back then, I played a part in the destruction of your Hu Clan. How do you plan to take revenge?”
Enraged, Hu Mazi charged at Fairy Chi Lian: “I’ll kill you!”
However, his strength was far inferior to hers. As he rushed forward, a powerful force sent him flying, blood spurting from his mouth as he crashed to the ground.
Fairy Chi Lian had now broken through to the fourth rank of the Earth Immortal Realm, far beyond Hu Mazi’s capabilities.
She stepped towards him, a glint of cruelty in her eyes: “Since you’ve delivered yourself to me, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”
At that critical moment, a loud explosion echoed from outside the palace, followed by a familiar voice: “Master Hu, run!”
Hu Mazi knew it was Chen Ping coming to his rescue. Struggling to his feet, he fled towards the palace’s exit.
Fairy Chi Lian watched his escaping figure, her eyes flashing with anger. She wanted to pursue him but was held back by the explosions and battle cries outside, unable to break free.
Hu Mazi escaped the palace and saw Chen Ping surrounded by a group of Chi Lian Sect experts, his body already bearing several wounds, clearly struggling in the fight.
“Chen Ping!”
Hu Mazi shouted, wanting to rush forward to help.
“Stay back! Run!”
Chen Ping yelled at him, unleashing a burst of powerful energy to push back the surrounding enemies, “I’ll catch up!”
Hu Mazi knew he’d only be a burden if he stayed. Gritting his teeth, he turned and fled towards the edge of Snake Coiling Mountain.
Fairy Chi Lian broke free from the chaos outside. Seeing Hu Mazi escape, her eyes burned with fury. She shouted to the Chi Lian Sect experts: “Stop him! Don’t let him get away!”
The sect’s experts immediately chased after Hu Mazi.
Chen Ping, seeing Hu Mazi’s escape, breathed a sigh of relief, knowing his goal was achieved.
No longer engaging in the fight, he turned and fled in another direction, drawing some of the Chi Lian Sect experts away.
A new chase unfolded on Snake Coiling Mountain.
Hu Mazi ran desperately through the dense forest, the Chi Lian Sect experts hot on his heels.
The snake demons were incredibly fast, weaving effortlessly through the trees, closing the distance.
His spiritual energy was nearly depleted, and the internal injuries from Fairy Chi Lian’s attack sent sharp pains through his chest, each breath laced with the taste of blood. But he didn’t dare stop, knowing capture meant certain doom.
“Bang!”
His foot caught on something, and Hu Mazi stumbled, crashing to the ground. The clan leader’s token flew from his hand, landing in the nearby grass.
Seeing this, the Chi Lian Sect experts grinned with excitement, quickly surrounding him.
“Keep running! Let’s see you try!”
The lead snake demon sneered, his longsword pointed at Hu Mazi’s throat, “Who’d have thought a remnant of the Hu Clan was still alive? Truly fate’s doing.”
Hu Mazi struggled to stand but was pinned down by the snake demon’s foot on his chest, unable to move.
