Chen Ping quickly steadied himself, a faint smile curling his lips. Finally, someone was sparring with him.
This way, he could clearly gauge the true extent of his Fourth-grade Loose Immortal Realm strength.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword in Chen Ping’s hand trembled slightly, and he soared into the air.
In the next moment, a colossal sword light slashed fiercely toward the black-robed elder.
The void itself was torn open by the sword’s radiance.
The black-robed elder’s expression grew grave. He hadn’t expected this seemingly Fourth-grade Loose Immortal to unleash such terrifying power.
He had thought he could easily subdue Chen Ping, but he had underestimated his strength.
Not daring to be careless, the elder took a sudden step forward, clenching his right fist and unleashing countless bolts of dark lightning in an instant.
The two clashed once more.
Boom!
The sword light and dark lightning exploded, sending shockwaves that shattered the surroundings, even pulverizing many of the Mo family’s courtyards.
Mo Wuji, heartbroken, hurriedly led the Mo family to cast protective shields to safeguard their homes.
“Not bad, old man,” Chen Ping grinned, “Let’s keep going.”
He swung his sword again toward the elder.
This strike was lightning-fast and cunningly angled. The elder’s face paled, and he thrust both palms forward, conjuring a black shield before him.
Boom!
The moment the sword light touched the shield, it shattered, and the sword light dissipated.
But Chen Ping didn’t stop. He continued to brandish the Dragon-Slaying Sword.
In an instant, another sword light appeared before the elder. Just as the elder, startled, prepared to summon another shield, he realized that sword lights weren’t just in front of him, they surrounded him entirely, dense and inescapable.
He was enveloped by sword lights, on the verge of being pierced through like a porcupine.
The elder roared, and bolts of lightning erupted from his body. The void churned with thunder, like an apocalyptic storm.
Rumble…
The lightning collided with the sword lights, producing a deafening crash as they shattered.
The elder fought while retreating, only stopping after several breaths, as the surrounding lightning gradually faded.
The black-robed elder was in a sorry state, blood gushing from countless wounds.
Meanwhile, Chen Ping held his Dragon-Slaying Sword, a playful smirk on his face, looking utterly at ease.
“You’re Fourth-grade Loose Immortal?” the elder asked.
“Yes,” Chen Ping nodded.
“Then why…” The elder wanted to ask more, but Chen Ping, uninterested, raised his Dragon-Slaying Sword again.
“Wait, wait!”
The elder flinched, feigning fear.
“Scared?” Chen Ping asked.
“Scared!” The elder nodded repeatedly, “If I’d known you were this strong, I wouldn’t have come even if you beat me to death.”
“How did you know I have a treasure from the ancient ruins?” Chen Ping asked.
He was curious. Only the Asura Hall and Tianyuan Pavilion knew about this.
The Asura Hall wouldn’t spread the news carelessly, so it had to be Tianyuan Pavilion.
“Someone spread the word. By now, the entire Third Heaven probably knows you have a treasure from the ancient ruins,” the elder replied.
“Who spread it?” Chen Ping pressed.
“No idea, it’s all anonymous,” the elder said, then added apologetically, “I’m really sorry for believing the rumors and offending you.”
With that, the elder turned to leave.
“Hold it,” Chen Ping called coldly.
The elder froze, his face filled with fear, “I’ve already surrendered. What more do you want? Don’t you know the rule, you can’t kill someone who surrenders?”
Chen Ping was speechless but said calmly, “I have my own rule. Hand over your resources, and I won’t kill you.”
“This…”
The elder hesitated.
But when Chen Ping lightly waved his Dragon-Slaying Sword, the elder hurriedly tossed his storage bag to Chen Ping.
Then, without looking back, he fled at lightning speed.
