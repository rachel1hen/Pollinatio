With the woman’s command, the dozen black-armoured female soldiers instantly formed a formation.
Their long spears turned into a sky full of chilling gleams, encircling Hu Mazi completely.
These female soldiers coordinated with uncanny precision, their spear tips weaving an impenetrable net of spiritual energy in the air.
“Ouch, are these ladies really so ruthless?” Hu Mazi cried out, dodging and weaving through the spear shadows, tossing out talismans one after another.
But those talismans, upon touching the black-armoured soldiers’ armour, vanished like mud sinking into the sea.
His expression changed, “God Clan’s magic-suppressing armour?”
Before he could finish, a spear pierced his sleeve, leaving a bloody gash on his arm.
Wincing in pain, Hu Mazi quickly formed a hand seal, summoning a talisman that emitted a blinding golden light.
Yet the female soldiers merely squinted, their assault unrelenting.
Cornered and desperate, Hu Mazi finally shouted, “Chen Ping! You’re still watching the show?”
“Master Hu, I gave you a chance to show off, but you’re just not up to it!” Chen Ping laughed.
“Stop with the sarcasm and help, or I’m done for!” Hu Mazi roared.
Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun exchanged a glance and sprang into action.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword transformed into a blood-red rainbow, shattering the spear tips of three female soldiers in an instant.
Mo Qingyun formed hand seals, and dozens of inky vines sprouted from the ground, entangling the ankles of several other soldiers.
Seeing this, the leading woman’s eyes blazed with cold fury beneath her golden helmet, “Lowly humans, daring to defy the God Clan’s majesty?”
Her treasured sword suddenly burst with dazzling white light, a sharp sword aura sweeping out, severing all the inky vines.
“Kill!”
The man from Cangxuan Continent, inspired by Chen Ping and the others, raised his arm and shouted.
Tens of thousands of cultivators surged forward like a tide, unwilling to sit idly by.
With Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun’s intervention, the female soldiers began to struggle, and now, with the sudden onslaught of tens of thousands of Cangxuan Continent cultivators, they were quickly overwhelmed and subdued!
But at that moment, the restrained black-armoured female soldiers shouted in unison, “The God Clan’s glory shall not be defiled!”
Their armour suddenly glowed with a piercing red light, and the spiritual energy within them began to reverse wildly.
“Not good! Fall back!” Chen Ping’s pupils contracted, and he swung the Dragon-Slaying Sword, creating a blood-red barrier in front of him.
The next moment, deafening explosions rang out, and a dozen blinding white lights erupted among the crowd.
A ferocious spiritual energy storm swept across a hundred-zhang radius, instantly turning hundreds of charging cultivators into blood mist.
As the dust settled, the battlefield revealed a dozen craters, each over a hundred zhang wide.
“What a pity, such fine ladies, gone before I could even get a taste,” Hu Mazi lamented, “Why go to such extremes? Better to live than die!”
The human cultivators of Cangxuan Continent were stunned.
The God Clan’s pride was unyielding, even their women were so resolute, truly iron-willed!
Young Master Huo’s face alternated between red and white, overcome with shame.
He was of the God Clan, the heir of the Eight Temples, yet he feared death!
He had the God Clan’s arrogance but none of their backbone.
The woman, gazing at the scattered limbs and wreckage, said icily, “See that? The God Clan is inviolable!”
She slowly discarded her sword, her white armour beginning to glow with golden light, “With my divine soul, I offer—”
“Damn, this woman’s going to self-destruct too!” Hu Mazi shouted in distress.
“Freeze!” Chen Ping roared, his time origin surging wildly, instantly halting time in the area.
The woman’s erupting power stopped abruptly. She struggled fiercely, her golden helmet falling to reveal a striking, heroic face, “Let me go, you filthy—”
Slap!
Chen Ping stepped forward and struck her across the face.
