In the centre of Beast City, a magnificent and huge city within a city stood majestically, and that was the mysterious and majestic City Lord’s Mansion of all the people in Beast City.
The City Lord’s Mansion was like a giant beast perched at the heart of the city, exuding an awe-inspiring aura.
In the three directions of east, west and south, there was a mansion each, and the decoration of these three mansions was so luxurious that it was simply staggering.
Mansion walls are made of precious jade, in the light of the moonlight flickers with a warm light; roof glazed tiles colourful, glittering; doors and windows carved with exquisite patterns, or beasts gallop, or immortal grass and flowers, every detail highlights the ultimate luxury.
These three mansions are in the position of a hand, will be tightly surrounded by the city hall, constituting an impregnable defence system.
Mansions echo each other, forming a close whole, anyone who wants to attack the city lord’s mansion, must first break through the defence line of these three mansions, its strategic significance is self-evident.
These three mansions are the residences of the three major beast generals under the city lord, they are not only the residences of the beast generals, but also the important barrier of the city lord’s mansion.
Late at night, the entire Beast City was immersed in silence, with only the guards on duty patrolling dutifully.
Their footsteps echoed in the empty streets, adding to the quietness of the night.
However, in the mansion in the east, it was still brightly lit, in stark contrast to the surrounding darkness.
In the hall, the atmosphere was slightly tense, and sitting in the first place was a middle-aged cultivator who was eight feet tall, he was General Xing, one of the three great beast generals.
General Xing’s eyes were like bronze bells, his gaze was deep and sharp, as if he could see through people’s hearts, exuding a majestic aura that made people not dare to look directly at him.
He wore a black robe with golden lines embroidered on it, which flickered with shimmering light as he moved, further revealing his dignified and extraordinary nature.
“Bai Cheng, can what you said be true? Inside that big prison, there are really Dragon Race cultivators? And also from the Golden Dragon Clan?”
General Xing’s voice was low and powerful, echoing in the hall with a hint of questioning and curiosity.
He frowned slightly, his gaze fixed on Bai Cheng, as if he wanted to see a hint of a break in his expression.
Bai Cheng sat at the lower position and replied with an affirmative face, “General Xing, how could I dare to deceive you, everything I said is true ah.”
His eyes revealed a hint of eagerness and his body leaned forward slightly, hoping that the general would believe him.
He knew that what he had said was too bizarre, but if he did not inform the General of this matter, he feared that there would be even more trouble in the future.
General Xing’s brows furrowed slightly after hearing this, obviously still somewhat not quite believing Bai Cheng’s words.
At this moment, a guest secretary spoke up, ”General Xing, in this Beast City, there has never been a true dragon cultivator in thousands of years, let alone one from the Golden Dragon Clan.
This Bai Cheng is nothing more than a scaly snake, wearing a fake dragon horn, just trying to act as a dragon race, I think he’s not crazy for wanting to transform into a dragon, he’s got paranoia ah.”
This guest secretary’s words were filled with mockery and scepticism as the corners of his mouth rose slightly, a hint of disdain appearing in his eyes. The other guest secretaries also nodded their heads in agreement, and a low murmur resounded in the hall.
When Bai Cheng heard this, he immediately became anxious and loudly defended, “Don’t spit blood, I saw it with my own eyes, can there be any mistake?”
His face turned red, his eyes flashed with anger, his hands tightly clenched into fists, as if at any moment he would rush up to have a theory with that guest minister.
How could he not expect that his words of truth would be questioned and denigrated in such a manner?
Another guest secretary also continued, “I also feel that what Fellow Daoist Bai said was a bit weird, he said that the other party was only a ninth ranked cultivator of the Transition realm, but he himself is a fourth ranked cultivator of the Mahayana realm, and yet he was defeated by a ninth ranked cultivator of the Transition realm, how is this possible?”
