“That’s it?” Chen Ping asked, his face full of surprise.
“What, you still want to kill me or something?”
The man’s expression darkened instantly as he spoke!
“No, Senior, don’t misunderstand, I didn’t mean it like that, I just thought it felt a bit too simple.”
Chen Ping hurriedly explained!
“Hmph, if I were at full strength, someone like you, I could crush with one finger.”
The man snorted coldly!
“Senior, may I boldly ask, you’re not a cultivator of this world, so why are you here as the gatekeeper?”
Chen Ping was deeply curious about where these gatekeepers came from and how they were chosen!
Hearing Chen Ping’s question, the man sighed, “Who says I’m not from this world, it’s just that my era was so long ago, most people have forgotten me.”
“Could it be that Senior is a great power of this world?” Chen Ping exclaimed in shock!
“A great power? Not quite, but through my own efforts, I ascended to the Heavenly Realm…” The man tilted his head back, gazing at the sky, his eyes filled with longing!
“Then why did you come back? And your strength, though impressive, is still far from that of a Heavenly Realm immortal.”
Chen Ping asked frankly!
“Don’t ask too much, it’s none of your concern, since you’ve passed, I’ll leave the clearance mark on you.”
With that, the man pressed his palm forward, and a red light struck Chen Ping’s body!
Instantly, Chen Ping felt a mark appear within him!
“Senior, are you going to stay here forever without leaving? This world is likely to be abandoned, and when that happens, it’ll be completely destroyed.”
Chen Ping was eager to understand what this Heavenly Ladder was all about!
The more he learned, the more he realized it was the creation of some mighty being, and they were all just pawns under its control!
Seeing Chen Ping persist, the man sighed, “We’ll never meet again, so I suppose there’s no harm in telling you…”
“I’m suppressed here by the Great Dao, branded with a prisoner’s mark, I can’t leave this place.”
“To put it plainly, I’m a prisoner now, serving my punishment…”
The man’s words left Chen Ping stunned, he had no idea the Heavenly Realm had prisoners!
“Then can you leave this Heavenly Ladder world? If you could, wouldn’t that mean you could return to the Heavenly Realm?”
Chen Ping asked!
The man shook his head, “I can’t leave here, and even if I could, there’s no way I could return to the Heavenly Realm, I know you’re all from the Heavenly Human Realm, it’s shrouded by the Heaven and Earth Array, cultivators of the Heavenly Realm trapped there can’t go back.”
“Besides, in the Heavenly Human Realm, you’re still suppressed by the Great Dao, it’s more comfortable to stay here…”
“Senior, the Heaven and Earth Array has already started to weaken, I believe it won’t be long before it can be broken!”
Chen Ping said!
“How could that be? The Heaven and Earth Array was set up by an ancient power, who in the Heavenly Human Realm could break it?”
The man didn’t believe Chen Ping!
“I can!” Chen Ping declared, pulling out four jade slips, “These are the four jade slips of the Heaven and Earth Array, I’ve already deciphered two, once I crack the remaining two, the array will appear, and then it can be undone!”
Seeing the four jade slips, a flicker of heat finally sparked in the man’s eyes as he looked at Chen Ping, “You want me to leave here, then use the chance to break the Heaven and Earth Array in the Heavenly Human Realm to return to the Heavenly Realm?”
“Exactly!” Chen Ping nodded!
“Why save me? Besides, I bear a prisoner’s mark, it has to be removed first, I need to shed my prisoner status before I can leave!”
The man asked!
“No reason, just wanted to do a good deed, that’s all!”
Chen Ping smiled lightly!
Looking at Chen Ping’s demeanor, the man laughed, “If you really save me, I’m willing to serve you, I’ll follow your orders for three hundred years!”
