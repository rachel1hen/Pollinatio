Chen Ping gave his opponent no time to react, drawing his bowstring and aiming at the Tianyuan Pavilion Master, a glint of resolve flashing in his eyes: “Die!”
The golden arrow shot from the bow, instantly transforming into a golden meteor, moving at such extreme speed that even space could not restrain its trajectory.
Where the arrow passed, it left a trail of blazing golden flames, igniting the air with a crackling “pop.”
The Tianyuan Pavilion Master dared not be careless. He swiftly summoned a blood-red coffin to shield himself, channeling all his blood corpse energy into it.
The blood-red coffin expanded several times in size, its surface covered with countless eerie runes, exuding a suffocating aura of death.
“Boom!!!”
The golden arrow struck the blood-red coffin, unleashing an energy shockwave even more terrifying than Sang Tianyang’s self-destruction.
The blood-red coffin trembled violently, its surface runes shattering inch by inch, a deep crack appearing on the lid, from which black corpse energy surged wildly.
The Tianyuan Pavilion Master was forced back by the impact, several blood corpse scales peeling off his arm, revealing pale skin beneath.
Yet, despite the God King Arrow’s power, it still failed to completely destroy the blood-red coffin or harm the Tianyuan Pavilion Master behind it.
“Cough, cough…” The Tianyuan Pavilion Master coughed a few times, wiping blood from his lips, his eyes gleaming with venomous resentment. “Well done, Chen Ping, you’ve successfully enraged me!”
Chen Ping looked at the God King Bow in his hand, its string now somewhat dim, clearly having consumed a vast amount of his Dao-patterned murderous aura.
He knew that, while powerful, the God King Bow could not easily defeat the Tianyuan Pavilion Master controlled by the blood corpse, especially since Chen Ping couldn’t use it for long.
“What do we do, Chen Ping?” Huo Jingjing asked anxiously.
Chen Ping clenched his jaw, his gaze turning resolute.
He knew there was only one option left: to once again request the possession of the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord!
Now, Chen Ping’s body could withstand most of the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord’s power!
At that moment, the Tianyuan Pavilion Master would be like an ant, easily crushed!
“Senior,” Chen Ping called out.
“Is it my turn to step in?” the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord asked with a yawn.
“I can’t handle this guy. Please take over, Senior!”
Chen Ping said.
As soon as he spoke, the Crimson Cloud Demon Flame within him roared to life, an overwhelmingly domineering force erupting from his dantian, instantly sweeping through his body.
His hair moved without wind, turning a burning crimson, his eyes becoming pure black with two demonic flames flickering in his pupils.
The Crimson Cloud Demon Lord’s voice echoed in his mind, carrying a hint of amusement and excitement: “Hahaha, finally, I can stretch my legs again. Let this Lord see what this blood corpse is capable of!”
As the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord’s power surged in, Chen Ping’s aura grew exponentially, the demonic energy he radiated clashing with the corpse energy of the Pavilion Master, creating a violent storm of energy in the air.
He raised the Dragon-Slaying Sword once more. This time, the blade was no longer azure but cloaked in blazing demonic flames, the patterns on the sword seeming to come alive, constantly pulsing with black demonic energy.
“Tianyuan Pavilion Master.”
Chen Ping’s voice became low and hoarse, laced with the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord’s authority. “Are you ready to meet your doom?”
The Tianyuan Pavilion Master looked at the transformed Chen Ping, sensing the terrifying demonic energy no weaker than his own. For the first time, a trace of genuine fear appeared on his blood-corpse-controlled face.
He knew this young man was the true threat!
“Kill!”
Chen Ping struck first, his figure vanishing in a flash.
The next second, he appeared before the Tianyuan Pavilion Master, the Dragon-Slaying Sword, wreathed in world-scorching demonic flames, slashing down with unstoppable force.
