“Chen Ping…”
Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun stepped forward to support him at the same time!
“Brother-in-law…”
“Dear son-in-law…”
Huo Zhao and Huo Feng were also visibly tense!
“It’s fine, I’ll recover after some rest. Three ninth-grade Loose Immortal realm experts, indeed not easy to deal with!”
Chen Ping wiped the bloodstains and said!
“Did you really kill those three people?” Huo Zhao asked, somewhat incredulously!
Chen Ping nodded firmly!
Huo Zhao looked at Chen Ping in disbelief, suddenly feeling that betraying the Temple and letting Huo Jingjing stay with Chen Ping was an incredibly wise decision!
“Jingjing, take Chen Ping to rest immediately!” Huo Zhao said!
Huo Jingjing nodded, but before they could leave, a terrifying aura suddenly enveloped the Eighth Hall!
Everyone looked up and saw an old man in a mysterious black robe, with a solemn expression, walking in surrounded by dozens of black-clad cultivators.
“The Master of Tianyuan Pavilion?” Seeing the newcomer, Chen Ping instantly furrowed his brow!
Huo Zhao’s eyes narrowed as he stepped forward, clasping his hands, “Master Tian, what brings you to my place?”
Being in the Second Heaven, Huo Zhao knew the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion!
But they usually had no dealings, and Tianyuan Pavilion dared not provoke the Eighth Hall, as behind the Eighth Hall stood the entire Temple, even the entire God Clan, which Tianyuan Pavilion could not afford to offend!
“I’m here for him…”
The Master of Tianyuan Pavilion pointed at Chen Ping and said!
“Master Tian, this is my son-in-law, now a member of our Eighth Hall. How has he provoked you?”
Huo Zhao was unaware that Chen Ping had killed Tianci and Elder Tong of Tianyuan Pavilion.
“He killed people from our Tianyuan Pavilion, so I’m here to take him away!” The Master of Tianyuan Pavilion said!
Huo Zhao was stunned, then looked at Chen Ping. Seeing that Chen Ping didn’t deny it, he knew it must be true!
“Master Tian, for killing your Tianyuan Pavilion members, we can compensate with resources, but you cannot take him away.”
“He is now part of our Eighth Hall. If you want to take Chen Ping, you’ll have to ask if our Temple agrees!”
Huo Zhao used the Temple to intimidate the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion!
“Hahaha, you’re quite the bluffer. You’re already a traitor to the Temple, and you still think you can scare me with it?”
The Master of Tianyuan Pavilion burst into laughter!
This left Huo Zhao instantly embarrassed, unsure of what to say!
Chen Ping pushed Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun aside, coldly staring at the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion!
“A defeated foe like you dares to come for me? Aren’t you afraid I’ll kill you?”
“One just escaped, a peak Loose Immortal realm cultivator, scared off.”
“See the heads on the ground? Those were Third Heaven experts, yet I still slew them.”
“You, a mere Master of Tianyuan Pavilion, what are you?”
Chen Ping spoke with an imposing air!
Seeing Chen Ping’s demeanour, the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion, far from being afraid, burst into laughter, “Chen Ping, keep pretending. You may fool others, but you can’t fool me!”
“I was the one who leaked the news about you possessing treasures from the ancient ruins. I also revealed your location to the Third Heaven people.”
“How you killed those three, I know exactly.”
“You’re at the end of your strength now. Let alone me, even a fifth-grade Loose Immortal could easily kill you now.”
The Master of Tianyuan Pavilion had calculated everything, orchestrating it all!
Chen Ping’s expression darkened. He hadn’t expected all this to be the work of the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion!
It seemed he had been completely outmanoeuvred, without even realising it!
This old man was far too cunning.
Chen Ping glared fiercely at the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion, yet he seemed utterly helpless!
He had no strength left to fight the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion now.
