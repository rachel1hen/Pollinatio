“Damn, speak properly…”
Chen Ping flared up instantly upon hearing this!
Yun Wuya jumped in fright and hurriedly said, “In the Third Heaven, the most powerful force on the surface is the Seven Halls, but in the Third Heaven, there’s also a mysterious place, and the force in that place is the most formidable.”
“A mysterious place?” Chen Ping frowned, “What kind of strength does that force have? What’s its name?”
Yun Wuya shook his head, “I don’t know, I don’t even know where this mysterious place is!”
“Damn, you’re messing with me…” Chen Ping, enraged, was about to take action!
“No, I’m not messing with you, I really don’t know where this mysterious place is or the name of this force.”
“All I know is they’re extremely secretive. Every time there’s a large-scale conflict with deaths in the Third Heaven, this mysterious organisation appears.”
“They never help any side, only collecting divine souls, so many suspect these people are from the Demon Clan, an organisation specialising in refining divine souls.”
Yun Wuya quickly explained!
Upon hearing this, Chen Ping immediately grew interested in this organisation. An organisation solely collecting divine souls was undoubtedly from the Demon Clan!
But for now, Chen Ping had no time to investigate this organisation. His current goal was to annihilate the Tianyan Sect, the Barbaric Ancient Clan, and the Blood Shadow Palace!
In the end, it would be the Seven Halls. After destroying the Seven Halls, Chen Ping would be the top dog in the Third Heaven!
He could show off freely, unmatched by anyone!
“You’re close to the Barbaric Ancient Clan here, take me there!” Chen Ping said!
“I advise you not to go. The Barbaric Ancient Clan’s Mountain-Splitting Barbarian King is at the Ninth Grade of the Loose Immortal Realm, with few rivals in the Third Heaven.”
“If you…”
Before Yun Wuya could finish, Chen Ping casually tossed the Mountain-Splitting Barbarian King’s head onto the ground!
“Are you talking about him?” Chen Ping said with a faint smile!
Seeing the Mountain-Splitting Barbarian King’s head, Yun Wuya was dumbfounded!
A Ninth Grade Loose Immortal, just killed like that, with his head chopped off?
This was too outrageous.
In Yun Wuya’s eyes, the Barbaric Ancient Clan was an unreachable existence. Compared to them, his Qingyun Sect was like an ant!
“Just lead the way, don’t worry about anything else!”
Chen Ping said to Yun Wuya!
Yun Wuya could only nod at this point, leading Chen Ping and the others straight towards the Barbaric Ancient Clan!
Yun Wuya guided Chen Ping’s group through the mountains of the Third Heaven, where the immortal aura was chaotic, ancient trees towered, and a faint smell of blood lingered in the air.
Hu Mazi yawned, Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun curiously observed the bizarre vegetation around them, while Chen Ping walked with his hands behind his back, his golden dragon eyes indifferently scanning the horizon, as if the surrounding dangers were mere backyard scenery.
“Yun Wuya, how much farther?”
Chen Ping’s voice was calm, yet it sent a shiver down the spine of the Qingyun Sect Leader walking ahead.
Just as he was about to speak, a chilling laugh echoed from deep within the dense forest ahead.
“Well, well, isn’t this the old dog of the Qingyun Sect? What’s this, bringing a bunch of riffraff to make trouble in my ‘Black Fiend Ridge’?”
Before the voice faded, dozens of black figures leapt down from the treetops. The leader wore a green-faced, fanged ghost mask and wielded a pitch-black long axe, exuding the aura of a Fifth Grade Loose Immortal. The others behind him were also Loose Immortals, clearly an elite team.
Yun Wuya’s face changed drastically as he whispered to Chen Ping, “Chen… Senior Chen, these are people from the Black Fiend Sect. They have a blood feud with my Qingyun Sect from years ago when they destroyed one of our peaks…”
“A blood feud?”
The masked man laughed wildly, slamming his axe into the ground, sending stones flying, “Yun Wuya, back then you cowered in your sect, too scared to show your face. Today, you dare bring outsiders to die? Who are these kids? Your new backers?”
His gaze swept over Chen Ping, noting his mere Fifth Grade Loose Immortal aura, and sneered, “Hah, you found a Fifth Grade Loose Immortal waste as your backer? The Qingyun Sect has truly fallen, picking such a pathetic thigh to cling to!”
