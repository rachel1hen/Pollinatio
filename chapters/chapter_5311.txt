“Damned fool!” Qin Lie snorted coldly and personally took action.
The palm wind of the Earth Immortal Realm eighth stage carried a momentum that could destroy heaven and earth, directly rushing towards Mo Chen’s face.
“Master, be careful!” Chen Ping was greatly alarmed and wanted to step forward to block it, but he was entangled by several Earth Immortal Realm cultivators.
“Bang!”
Mo Chen was no match for Qin Lie at all. He was sent flying by one palm, heavily crashing into the wall, blood spurting wildly from his mouth.
“Master!”
“Old thing!”
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi roared in anger at the same time, wanting to rescue him, but they were firmly blocked.
Qin Lie walked step by step towards the fallen Mo Chen, a cruel smile appearing on his face. “Mo Chen, back then your Sword Sect was so glorious. Now, haven’t you fallen to this state? Hand over your Sword Sect’s secret manual, and I might still give you a quick death.”
“Delusional!”
Mo Chen coughed out a mouthful of blood foam, his eyes full of unyielding spirit.
Killing intent surged in Qin Lie’s eyes. He lifted his foot and was about to stomp towards Mo Chen’s head.
At this critical moment, a clear and cold voice rang out.
“Manor Lord Qin, bullying the weak with strength; isn’t that too unsightly?”
Everyone looked towards the sound and saw Ling Xue had at some point blocked in front of Mo Chen. The long sword in her hand pointed straight at Qin Lie. Although her figure trembled slightly due to fear, her gaze was exceptionally firm.
“A little girl dares to block me?” A trace of disdain flashed in Qin Lie’s eyes. His palm wind unchanged, he struck towards Ling Xue.
He did not take this Ling Xue seriously at all. With this palm, at best she would be severely injured; at worst, she would die.
Chen Ping’s eyes were bloodshot with rage. He wanted to break free from the restraints but was powerless. He could only watch helplessly as the palm wind approached.
“Bang!”
The expected tragic scene did not occur. A golden light curtain suddenly appeared in front of Ling Xue, forcibly blocking Qin Lie’s palm wind.
“Who?” Qin Lie’s expression changed slightly, and he sharply looked around.
Li Chunfeng had appeared in the courtyard at some unknown time. With a light wave of the horsetail whisk in his hand, the golden light curtain slowly dissipated.
“City Lord Li?”
Qin Lie’s pupils contracted slightly. He did not expect Li Chunfeng to appear again. “This matter has nothing to do with the city lord. Please do not interfere.”
“In Sword Saint City, private fights are prohibited. Has Manor Lord Qin forgotten?” Li Chunfeng’s tone was flat, yet it carried an unquestionable authority.
Qin Lie’s expression fluctuated between dark and light. He knew that Li Chunfeng’s strength was unfathomable. If the other party insisted on protecting Chen Ping, he really would not gain any advantage.
But upon thinking of his son’s miserable state, the anger in his heart burned again. “City lord, this kid injured my son and ruined the face of my Divine Sword Manor. This enmity is irreconcilable!”
“Qin Feng provoked first and used despicable means afterwards. Chen Ping was merely defending himself and counterattacking.”
Li Chunfeng said indifferently. “I have already investigated this matter. Divine Sword Manor is at fault first. If Manor Lord Qin insists on making trouble, don’t blame this old man for being impolite.”
The pressure of the Earth Immortal Realm ninth stage enveloped like substance. Qin Lie immediately felt difficulty in breathing, and his face turned pale.
The sect leaders behind him also retreated one after another, obviously extremely wary of Li Chunfeng.
“Good! What a Li Chunfeng!” Qin Lie gritted his teeth, a trace of venom flashing in his eyes. “I, Divine Sword Manor, will remember today’s humiliation! Let’s go!”
With that, he glared fiercely at Chen Ping and left in embarrassment with his people.
Those sects that had originally followed Qin Lie to join the excitement, upon seeing this, also wisely retreated one by one, afraid of bringing trouble upon themselves.
The Zhang responsible watched this scene, his face alternating between green and white. He wanted to say something, but was forced back by Li Chunfeng’s cold gaze.
The crisis was resolved, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
“Many thanks to City Lord Li for lending a hand again.” Chen Ping stepped forward and solemnly performed a salute.
Li Chunfeng waved his hand. “It was nothing. However, Qin Lie is someone who bears grudges over the smallest things. You should still be more careful.”
He paused and added. “I still have important matters to handle, so I’ll take my leave first. If you encounter difficulties, you can still call for me.”
With that, he transformed into a white rainbow and disappeared into the horizon.
