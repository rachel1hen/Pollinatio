“Hahaha, you’re too crazy, you’re not afraid of the wind flashing your tongue.”
Qiu Tu laughed out loud!
The more rampant Chen Ping was, the more Qiu Tu despised him, after all, someone who was truly powerful would not be so arrogant!
Only a bluffer would dare to talk like this!
“Mr. Qiu, old man’s hands are itching, let me deal with him ……”
Master Luan had been itching for a long time listening to Chen Ping’s bragging words, so he planned to make a move against Chen Ping!
This was also to prove it to himself, after all, the formation just now, was indeed broken by Chen Ping!
At this time, if he could not take Chen Ping under his wing, then he would lose face!
“Master Luan, thank you ……”
Qiu Tu nodded!
Grandmaster Luan’s eyes became stern, his hands quickly formed seals and his mouth chanted as if he was chanting an ancient and mysterious incantation.
In mid-air .Two huge points of light appeared, and those two huge points of light began to slowly rotate, releasing a dazzling light, forming a complex and huge formation pattern, trapping Chen Ping firmly in the center.
“Hmph, kid, being able to break me for a while does not mean that you can break all my means! Today, let you see what the true way of formations is!”
Master Luan’s voice carried a bit of smugness and disdain, as if he had already foreseen Chen Ping’s imminent helplessness in this formation.
However, in the face of this overwhelming array pressure, Chen Ping appeared exceptionally calm.
His eyes were slightly closed, as if he was sensing something, and then snapped open with a flash of brilliant light.
Only to see him lightly lift his right hand, his fingertips lightly pointing into the void, his mouth lightly spitting out a word: “Unravel!”
Along with this soft drink, the original seemingly impenetrable formation light shield even began to appear a tiny crack, and then like a broken mirror, it shattered, turning into a bit of light that dissipated in the air.
Chen Ping was still standing in the same place, his clothes fluttering, his expression indifferent, as if what had just happened was nothing more than an irrelevant wind blowing.
“What?!”Grandmaster Luan’s face instantly turned iron blue, he looked at this scene with disbelief, his own proud formation was so easily cracked by Chen Ping!
Unwillingly, Grandmaster Luan once again pushed his entire body’s spiritual energy, his hands rapidly changing in an attempt to rearrange a more powerful formation.
But no matter how hard he tried, no matter how complex and varied the formation was, whenever it was about to take shape, it would always be easily dissolved by Chen Ping in an unbelievable way of finding a break.
“Master Luan, your formation, it seems to be nothing more than that.”The corner of Chen Ping’s mouth hooked up with a faint smile, his tone filled with confidence and calmness.
Grandmaster Luan’s face turned green and white for a while, he knew deep down that continuing further would only add to the joke.
In the end, he could only sigh helplessly and withdrew all of his spiritual energy, his figure trembling slightly, clearly deeply shaken by Chen Ping’s strength.
“Mr. Qiu, there is nothing more that the old man …… can do.”
Master Luan lowered his head, a hint of shame and frustration in his voice.
As Qiu Tu watched this scene, his heart was also filled with mixed feelings.
He originally thought that with Master Luan s strength, it was enough to easily take down Chen Ping, but he did not expect the result to be so unexpected.
Qian Yue and the youngest sister’s brother saw this scene, is also full of shock, so it seems, Chen Ping’s formation art, indeed than this what Luan master is much more powerful!
Xiong broad siblings and the youngest sister, see Chen Ping easily break Luan master formation, inner happy!
It seemed that they might be saved!
“Kid, you really have some skills!”
Qiu Tu looked at Chen Ping, his brows slightly furrowed!
“With this broken formation, how dare you call yourself a master, how ridiculous!”
Chen Ping looked at that Master Luan with disdain and a relaxed expression!
However, that Master Luan did not get angry as he listened to Chen Ping’s mockery, his gaze locked onto Chen Ping, and a more complex light flickered in his eyes.
“Kid, you fell for it ……”
Suddenly, a sinister smile flashed across that Master Luan’s face!
