The setting sun, red as blood, splashed across the mountain gate of the Seventh Hall.
Chen Ping led the group to their destination. At this moment, he stood with his hands behind his back, while Hu Mazi and the others followed at a distance, watching his solitary figure cast a long shadow in the evening glow, exuding an unmatched aura of authority.
The cultivators of the Qingyun Sect had eyes gleaming with fervor and awe, knowing that a fierce battle was about to begin, and they were here to witness a miracle!
Chen Ping was now steadily approaching the lair of the Seventh Hall Master.
“Mr. Chen, are you really going to storm the Seventh Hall alone?” Yun Wuya swallowed hard, gazing at the mist-shrouded main peak of the Seventh Hall, his voice trembling, “The Seventh Hall Master is at the peak of the Ninth Grade of the Scattered Immortal Realm, and who knows how many other Ninth Grade Scattered Immortal cultivators are in the Seventh Hall…”
Chen Ping didn’t turn his head, his voice carried by the wind, tinged with a hint of mockery, “Ninth Grade peak? In my eyes, it’s just a slightly larger ant.”
With the experience of slaying the five Ghost-Masked Men and having comprehended so much sword intent from that Sword Sect, Chen Ping now felt terrifyingly powerful!
With that, his figure flickered, transforming into a streak of light that shot straight toward the main peak of the Seventh Hall.
The protective mountain array before the gate flared with light, countless runes weaving into a net to block his path.
Chen Ping’s lips curled into a cold smirk. With a flick of his finger, an almost imperceptible wisp of chaotic energy shot out, like an invisible pair of scissors, instantly tearing the protective array to shreds!
“Boom!”
The sound of the array shattering echoed through the Seventh Hall. Countless disciples, in the midst of their cultivation, looked up in shock, only to see a figure striding into the Seventh Hall Master’s treasure hall as if entering an unguarded land!
At that moment, the Seventh Hall Master was sitting cross-legged in the center of the hall, pondering how to report to the Fourth Hall Master.
Since returning from the Eighth Hall, the Seventh Hall Master had remained in seclusion, still shaken by the overwhelming impression Chen Ping had left on him.
But now, his understanding of Chen Ping was still too limited, leaving him unsure of how to explain things to the Fourth Hall Master!
Suddenly, the glass dome of the hall exploded, debris flying everywhere. Chen Ping descended like a god, landing steadily in the center of the hall, his gaze coldly sweeping over the Seventh Hall Master.
“Seventh Hall Master, all well since we last met?”
Chen Ping’s voice was soft, yet it struck like a thunderclap in the Seventh Hall Master’s ears.
He snapped his eyes open, seeing Chen Ping’s young face, brimming with boundless killing intent. His heart clenched, nearly causing him to topple from his meditation cushion.
“Chen… Chen Ping! What are you doing in my Seventh Hall?” the Seventh Hall Master asked.
“What do you think?” Chen Ping gave a cold smile.
“I have no grudge against you, I don’t want to be your enemy, and I hope you won’t trouble me.”
“Whatever issues you have with the Divine Hall, I know nothing about them.”
The Seventh Hall Master had no desire to make an enemy of Chen Ping!
He feared he couldn’t defeat him.
“If you don’t want to be my enemy, then why did you go to the Eighth Hall? Why did you act against it?” Chen Ping questioned sharply.
“I went to the Eighth Hall only to see you, not to do anything to you.”
“I was following the Fourth Hall Master’s orders to investigate your identity and background, nothing more!”
The Seventh Hall Master explained.
Chen Ping’s eyes narrowed. He hadn’t expected even the Fourth Hall Master to take notice of him. If the Seventh Hall Master was already at the peak of the Ninth Grade of the Scattered Immortal Realm, what kind of strength did the Fourth Hall Master possess? Chen Ping didn’t dare to imagine!
“I don’t care whether you want to be my enemy or not. Today, I’m here to destroy you, unless you willingly withdraw from the Divine Hall.”
“The Barbaric Ancient Clan, Tianyan Sect, and Blood Shadow Palace have all been eradicated by me. I won’t let a single person who offends me go free!”
Chen Ping stared coldly at the Seventh Hall Master as he spoke.
“Chen Ping, you’re going too far. Do you think I’m afraid of you?”
The Seventh Hall Master’s brows furrowed.
Withdrawing from the Divine Hall? That was impossible. If he withdrew today, he’d likely be dead by tomorrow.
“If you’re not afraid of me, then make your move!” Chen Ping laughed.
