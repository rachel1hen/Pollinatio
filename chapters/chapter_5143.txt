The old sect master had been in seclusion, aiming to ascend to the Fourth Heaven and reach the Earth Immortal Realm.
Ling Yunxiao’s gaze was sharp as a torch, sweeping over the chaotic scene before settling on the pale-faced Elder Zhao, “What matter calls for me? Don’t you know I’m in seclusion?”
Ling Yunxiao’s voice was icy, causing all the Tianyan Sect disciples, including Elder Zhao, to tremble.
“Old Sect Master, I had no choice. The current sect master has been killed, enemies have come to our door, and we can’t hold them back!”
Elder Zhao said helplessly.
“Is it him?” Ling Yunxiao fixed his gaze on Chen Ping.
Elder Zhao nodded.
Ling Yunxiao’s eyes landed on Chen Ping, filled with displeasure, “Who exactly are you? Why are you attacking our Tianyan Sect?”
With his peak ninth-grade Loose Immortal cultivation, he didn’t truly take Chen Ping seriously, despite his tricks.
Chen Ping raised his eyes, meeting Ling Yunxiao’s gaze, and said word by word, “I told you, I’m here to annihilate your sect.”
“Insolent!”
Ling Yunxiao was enraged. As the old sect master of Tianyan Sect, when had he ever faced such provocation?
With a wave of his right hand, a radiant long sword appeared, the Tianyan Sect’s treasured Tianyan Divine Sword.
“Today, I’ll show you that the dignity of a peak Loose Immortal is inviolable!”
With that, Ling Yunxiao slashed out, the world changing colour as countless sword energies formed a massive golden dragon, roaring towards Chen Ping.
This strike carried Ling Yunxiao’s lifelong cultivation, powerful enough to split mountains and seas, unreachable for ordinary sixth or seventh-grade Loose Immortals.
Hu Mazi and the others paled at the sight, wanting to help, but Chen Ping stopped them with a glance.
Chen Ping knew they’d be of no help and would only distract him.
A mere peak ninth-grade Loose Immortal? Chen Ping didn’t take it seriously!
Especially after training in the Barbaric Body Refining Technique, his physique had grown several times stronger, boosting his power significantly.
Chen Ping stood still, golden light radiating around him, his Indestructible Golden Body pushed to its limit. Combined with his physical strength, his body was now comparable to a divine weapon.
Without using any weapon, Chen Ping extended his right hand, fingers spread, grabbing directly at the golden dragon.
Showing off? Of course, he couldn’t use a weapon!
Otherwise, the effect would be greatly diminished!
“Rip…”
An unbelievable scene unfolded.
Chen Ping’s palm pierced the golden dragon’s body like cutting through tofu, his fingers directly grasping the blade of the Tianyan Divine Sword.
“How is this possible?”
Ling Yunxiao was stunned, his face full of shock.
The Tianyan Divine Sword, a congenital spiritual sword, indestructible, had never been grasped barehanded!
And yet, the opponent’s palm was unscathed, not even a scratch!
More terrifyingly, as Chen Ping gripped the blade, an overwhelming force surged through it, numbing Ling Yunxiao’s arm and churning his blood.
Pfft!
Ling Yunxiao spat out a mouthful of blood.
The Tianyan Divine Sword trembled violently in Chen Ping’s hand, buzzing with reluctance, faintly showing signs of breaking free from Ling Yunxiao’s control.
“What… what kind of power is this?”
Ling Yunxiao’s face was ashen, his eyes filled with fear as he looked at Chen Ping.
He finally realised that this seemingly young cultivator was far more terrifying than he’d imagined.
Chen Ping had no interest in wasting words. With a sharp twist of his wrist.
Crack!
A faint crack appeared on the Tianyan Divine Sword.
“No! My Tianyan Divine Sword!”
Ling Yunxiao let out a heart-wrenching scream; this was the foundation of the Tianyan Sect!
At that moment, Chen Ping stopped holding back, unleashing the divine dragon power within him. A golden dragon silhouette slowly emerged behind him!
As the golden dragon appeared, the entire Tianyan Peak trembled violently.
“Let’s see how my golden dragon compares?”
Chen Ping said with a faint smile!
