Mo Qingyun was so embarrassed by his words that she wished she could find a crack in the ground to crawl into.
Huo Jingjing took a deep breath, looked up at Chen Ping, her eyes shy yet resolute, “As long as it helps everyone, I’m willing.”
Seeing Huo Jingjing agree, Mo Qingyun bit her lip and nodded, her head hanging even lower.
Chen Ping said no more. His fingertip brushed his brow, and the golden light of the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda flared again, enveloping all three of them.
As Hu Mazi’s laughter faded from their ears, the trio stood in the inner hall of the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda.
The spiritual energy here was a hundred times denser than outside, with immortal stones scattered across the floor emitting a soft glow. At the centre, a jade bed layered with thousand-year warm jade gently nurtured the soul.
“Don’t be afraid.”
Chen Ping grasped their hands, the warmth of his Golden Dragon bloodline flowing through his palms, “Relax your mind and follow my spiritual energy.”
Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun closed their eyes, feeling the warm golden current slowly seeping into their bodies.
At first, they were tense, but when the golden flow touched the cold, hidden injuries in their meridians, a soothing tingle spread, and they gradually relaxed.
Chen Ping sat cross-legged, positioning them on either side, his palms resting on their dantian.
He activated the Heart-Calming Technique, channelling the primal force of his Golden Dragon bloodline into two golden threads that gently probed their bodies.
Wherever the golden bloodline passed, the cold energy melted like snow under sunlight, emitting a faint sizzling sound.
Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun let out muffled groans as waves of warmth surged in their dantian. Their stagnant spiritual energy began to surge, racing through their meridians.
“Now!” Chen Ping gave a low shout, guiding their energies to merge with his Golden Dragon bloodline.
In an instant, the three figures were enveloped in a golden cocoon of light, where dragon shadows coiled and green lotuses bloomed intermittently.
Dual cultivation was not mere taking but a complementary resonance of energies.
Chen Ping’s domineering Golden Dragon bloodline perfectly neutralised the cold energy in their bodies, while their spiritual energy, in turn, stabilised his slightly unsteady realm after his breakthrough.
Time flowed differently in the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda; a moment outside was days within.
Chen Ping stood and dressed. With his current strength, handling two women was effortless.
As the golden cocoon dissipated, Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun opened their eyes, their gazes shimmering with spiritual light, exuding the formidable aura of sixth-grade Loose Immortal Realm.
The bruises on Mo Qingyun’s wrists had vanished, her skin now radiant as jade.
Huo Jingjing’s weary expression was gone, her aura colder and more ethereal, yet softened by a nourished charm.
“I… broke through?” Mo Qingyun stared at her hands, feeling unprecedented power, her face alight with joy.
Huo Jingjing clenched her fists, clearly sensing her previous bottleneck shattered, her spiritual energy flowing ten times smoother than before.
Chen Ping withdrew his hands, his Golden Dragon bloodline slightly depleted but more refined, “Now you see, it’s not just about taking advantage, is it?”
Mo Qingyun’s cheeks flushed, and she shot him a reproachful glance, unaware of the allure in her eyes.
Huo Jingjing stepped forward, gently holding Chen Ping’s arm, her voice trembling faintly, “You nearly killed us both, we’re all swollen.”
Chen Ping patted her hand, his gaze warm, “It’s fine, a little rest will fix it.”
The three shared a smile, their earlier shyness now a silent understanding.
When they emerged from the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda, Hu Mazi’s eyes widened at Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun’s auras.
“Bloody hell! Sixth-grade Loose Immortal Realm?!”
Hu Mazi rubbed his eyes, circling them, “Chen Ping, your healing skills are unreal! Not only curing ailments but boosting them like that?” He winked at Chen Ping, “Be honest, these past few days inside, they didn’t drain you dry, did they?”
