Chen Ping coldly glanced at Elder Tong, a sudden thought crossing his mind.
If he opened the coffins now and there were treasures inside, these people would surely fight over them.
Although Chen Ping had reached the third rank of the Loose Immortal Realm and feared none of them individually, he was still wary if they teamed up against him.
With this in mind, Chen Ping calmly gazed at the remaining two coffins, as if an idea had struck him.
A red glow emanated from Chen Ping’s palm, enveloping the two coffins. The blood-red runes flowing on the coffins began to merge with his red light!
Everyone watched Chen Ping, clueless about what he was doing.
“Rise…”
With a loud shout from Chen Ping, both coffins were lifted into the air. A flash of white light followed, and the two coffins vanished.
Chen Ping had stored the coffins in his storage ring. Whatever treasures they held, he planned to inspect them after leaving this place.
Checking the coffins in front of these people would be unwise.
If there were treasures, they would surely turn against him.
Seeing Chen Ping take both coffins, everyone was stunned!
Their gazes towards Chen Ping were filled with varied intentions.
“Kid, those coffins are part of this relic. The treasures inside should belong to all of us. How dare you take them for yourself?” Tianci roared angrily, seeing Chen Ping claim the coffins!
“Is this relic your family’s property?” Chen Ping asked.
“No!” Tianci shook his head.
“If it’s not yours, what’s it to you if I take them?” Chen Ping no longer feared Tianci.
In a real fight, Tianci was no match for him now.
Tianci was taken aback. He hadn’t expected Chen Ping, who had been so deferential moments ago, to act so boldly now.
“Kid, is that how you speak to me?”
Tianci asked in disbelief!
“I’m talking to a dog!” Chen Ping smirked.
The white-robed woman burst out laughing.
Mo Qingyun covered her mouth, smiling.
Tianci’s eyes widened, his fury erupting, “Kid, you’re fucking dead…”
With that, Tianci launched an attack on Chen Ping.
Tianci struck in rage, his fifth-rank Loose Immortal Realm aura exploding, shaking the entire relic space!
Golden light surged around him, dazzling like the sun. With each step, the ground cracked into spiderweb-like fissures.
“Kid, I’ll show you what it means to know your place!”
A brilliant golden light gathered in his palm, forming a three-metre-long golden spear, its tip radiating sharp, piercing energy, aimed straight at Chen Ping’s throat!
Tian Yuan Pavilion’s ultimate technique, Heaven-Breaking Spear!
As the spear thrust forward, space itself seemed to warp slightly, the air torn apart with a shrill, explosive sound.
The spear moved like a dragon, carrying an unstoppable force, enough to instantly kill an ordinary sixth-rank Loose Immortal cultivator!
“Chen Ping, be careful!”
Mo Qingyun cried out, her beautiful eyes filled with worry, her delicate hands unconsciously clutching her clothes.
Elder Tong snorted, thinking Tianci was overestimating Chen Ping.
A mere third-rank Loose Immortal, why use the Heaven-Breaking Spear? A single punch would suffice.
The white-robed woman and her three black-robed companions watched quietly, convinced Chen Ping was doomed.
Yet, Chen Ping stood his ground, unmoving, a slight smirk on his lips, a hint of disdain in his eyes.
Just as the spear’s tip was three inches from his throat.
Whoosh!
Chen Ping’s figure suddenly blurred, dodging to the side like a phantom. At the same time, his right fist glowed with golden light, smashing fiercely towards Tianci’s chest!
“Holy Light Fist!”
Boom…!
Tianci hurriedly conjured a protective golden light at his chest, trying to dodge, but it was too late.
The punch landed squarely on Tianci’s chest, its force surging like cascading waves.
