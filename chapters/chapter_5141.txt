Hu Mazi was about to step forward to argue, but Chen Ping raised a hand to stop him.
Chen Ping looked up at the towering mountain gate, a cold smirk curling his lips, “Tell the person in charge of your Tianyan Sect to come out, I’m here to take his head.”
As his words fell, the air around them froze instantly.
The two disciples were stunned for a moment, then burst into laughter.
“Hahaha! Where did this madman come from? Daring to spout nonsense at the Tianyan Sect’s gate!”
“With your cultivation barely at the fifth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, has a donkey kicked your brain? You dare cause trouble here?”
One of the disciples, growing impatient, waved his hand, summoning a cyan small sword, its tip aimed directly at Chen Ping’s forehead, “Get lost quick, or don’t blame us for being merciless and letting you taste the might of our Tianyan Sect’s swordsmanship!”
Chen Ping didn’t even bother to glance at it, merely stirring his aura slightly.
“Hum…”
An invisible pressure, like a galaxy pouring down from the ninth heaven, instantly enveloped the entire Inquiry Platform.
The two disciples, both at the sixth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, felt an overwhelming force like a mountain pressing down on them.
With two thuds, they fell to their knees, their bones creaking under the strain, blood spurting from their mouths, the cyan small sword clattering to the ground, shattering into dust.
“You… who are you?” one disciple asked, his face full of terror.
Chen Ping didn’t answer, merely casting a glance, and the disciple’s body exploded instantly, blood splattering all over the other disciple!
The remaining disciple was scared witless, frantically kowtowing on the stone slab, “Senior, spare me! Senior, spare me!”
Chen Ping walked past him indifferently, not even pausing, “Noisy.”
Chen Ping and his group stepped through the mountain gate, and the patrolling disciples along the way gasped in shock, some immediately sounding the alarm bell.
“Dang… dang… dang…”
The resonant bell echoed across Tianyan Peak, startling the elders in seclusion.
Soon, five streaks of light shot from various parts of Tianyan Peak, landing in front of Chen Ping.
Leading them was a white-haired, youthful-faced elder in an apricot-yellow robe, a jade pendant engraved with “Tianyan Elder” hanging at his waist, Elder Zhao, the overseer of punishment, with an eighth-rank Loose Immortal Realm cultivation.
Elder Zhao’s gaze was sharp as lightning, sweeping over Chen Ping’s group, finally settling on Chen Ping, his brows slightly furrowed, “Who are you? Why do you trespass in our sect and harm our disciples?”
He could sense the unfathomable aura on Chen Ping, not merely the fifth-rank Loose Immortal Realm he appeared to be.
But Elder Zhao wasn’t overly concerned, Tianyan Sect, as a great sect, had countless cultivators at the sixth and seventh ranks of the Loose Immortal Realm, even if Chen Ping hid his strength, he wouldn’t necessarily gain the upper hand here.
“I’m here to exterminate your sect.”
Chen Ping’s words were concise, his tone as calm as if discussing something trivial.
“Exterminate our sect?” An elder behind Elder Zhao, a middle-aged man, couldn’t help but scoff, “Kid, do you know what you’re saying? Our Tianyan Sect has stood for ten thousand years, producing three Earth Immortal Realm ancestors, all ascended to the Fourth Heaven, how dare a little brat like you act so arrogantly here!”
“Our Tianyan Sect has no enmity with you, why do you wish to wipe out our entire sect?”
Elder Zhao looked at Chen Ping, utterly perplexed!
Another elder said coldly, “Brother Zhao, why waste words with this kid? Take him down first!”
With that, he flicked his sleeve, and eighteen red flags shot into the sky, instantly forming a vast formation, red mist spreading, countless piercing wails echoing from within, attacking the soul.
“Hmph, petty tricks.”
Chen Ping snorted coldly, not even drawing his Dragon-Slaying Sword, merely flicking his finger.
A golden beam shot out, piercing through the red mist like a hot knife through butter, striking the eighteen flags with a bang.
In an instant, the flags shattered inch by inch, the formation collapsed with a boom, and the elder who set it up felt a jolt in his chest, his qi and blood surging, stumbling back several steps, blood trickling from his mouth.
