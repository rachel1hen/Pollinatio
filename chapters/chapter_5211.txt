Chen Ping’s heart stirred. Green Snake Valley was also a power on the outskirts of Nine Coils Mountain, its leader a snake demon at the third rank of Earth Immortal.
The Black Wind Old Demon’s order to kill the Green Snake Valley leader was clearly a scheme to use them as pawns.
“No problem,” Chen Ping said. “We’ll handle it now.”
“Wait,” the Black Wind Old Demon said. “I’m sending two of my men with you, to see what you’re capable of.” He pointed at two wolf demons nearby. “You two, go with them. If they try anything sneaky, kill them!”
The two wolf demons stepped forward, bowing to the Black Wind Old Demon. “Yes, Chief!”
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi exchanged a glance, nodded, and followed the wolf demons out of the meeting hall.
Outside, Hu Mazi whispered, “This Black Wind Old Demon is up to no good. He wants us and Green Snake Valley to destroy each other.”
“I know,” Chen Ping replied. “It’s a chance to scout Green Snake Valley. Let’s head there and play it by ear.”
The two followed the wolf demons, leaving Black Wind Stronghold and heading east towards Green Snake Valley.
Along the way, the wolf demons kept provoking Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, clearly not taking them seriously.
Chen Ping ignored their taunts, focusing on the journey.
After about half a day, a dense bamboo forest appeared ahead, shrouded in faint green mist that carried a strong snake stench.
“That’s Green Snake Valley,” one wolf demon said, pointing at the forest. “The leader’s inside. Go in yourselves, we’ll wait here.”
Chen Ping knew the wolf demons were hoping to profit from their conflict, but he didn’t care. He turned to Hu Mazi. “Let’s go in.”
They entered the bamboo forest, where the mist grew thicker and the snake stench stronger.
After walking for about the time it takes to burn an incense stick, a massive valley appeared, filled with caves. The cave entrances were crawling with venomous snakes, exuding a dangerous aura.
“This is Green Snake Valley,” Hu Mazi said, frowning at the snakes. “There’s probably no shortage of snake demons here.”
“Be careful. The Green Snake Valley leader is strong, we need to be ready,” Chen Ping said.
As they stepped into the valley, a hissing sound erupted. Countless venomous snakes slithered from the caves, swarming towards them.
“I’ll handle these snakes!” Hu Mazi said, pulling out several talisman papers from his robe. He quickly drew fireball talismans and hurled them at the snakes.
The fireball talismans exploded in dazzling light, instantly reducing swathes of snakes to ashes.
But the snakes kept coming, wave after wave, crawling endlessly from the caves, overwhelming the pair.
Just then, a cold voice echoed from the valley’s depths. “Who dares trespass in my Green Snake Valley?”
A middle-aged man in a green robe emerged from the valley’s depths. His face was handsome but sinister, his lips curled in a cold smile. It was the Green Snake Valley leader.
Seeing the burning snake corpses, anger flashed in his eyes. “Did the Black Wind Old Demon send you?”
“So what if he did?” Chen Ping replied. “Today’s your last day!”
The Green Snake Valley leader sneered. “Just you two? You’re overestimating yourselves!”
His form flickered, transforming into a massive green snake, dozens of metres long. It opened its jaws and lunged at them.
The green snake was lightning-fast, its attack carrying a fierce gust, reaching them in an instant.
Its mouth exuded a foul stench, dizzying and disorienting.
“Watch out!” Chen Ping shouted, summoning his Dragon-Slaying Sword. A golden sword aura formed a barrier in front of them.
