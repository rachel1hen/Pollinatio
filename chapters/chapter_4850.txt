Li Chunfeng and the red-robed old ghost were locked in combat, their movements lightning-fast, while waves of terrifying power caused the No Delusion Land to shimmer with an unreal haze!
Many other cultivators, witnessing their fight, wore expressions of utmost gravity, as if the No Delusion Land could collapse at any moment!
“Old Li, I’ll help you…”
Seeing this, Nan Batian intended to assist Li Chunfeng!
“You’d better fight me instead…” At that moment, an old man emerged from the black mist surrounding Ming Shao!
This old man was clad in a black robe, but his face was a deep, purplish red, resembling a monkey’s backside!
“Bloody hell, where did another one come from?”
Chen Ping frowned upon seeing this!
Nan Batian, eyeing the red-faced old ghost, also furrowed his brow slightly and said, “You monkey-arse, still fancy a go at me?”
The red-faced old ghost froze, then stared at Nan Batian in shock. “You know me?”
“Nope!” Nan Batian shook his head!
“If you don’t know me, how do you know my name?”
The red-faced old ghost asked, puzzled!
“What’s your name? It’s not really Monkey-Arse, is it?”
Nan Batian inquired!
“Exactly, I’m called Hou Ding,” the red-faced old ghost nodded!
“Bloody hell, I was just guessing! Enough nonsense, once I kill you, I’ve still got to help Old Li…”
With that, Nan Batian swung a fist straight at the red-faced old ghost!
This blow made the No Delusion Land’s illusionary state worsen even further!
Fights were breaking out everywhere across the No Delusion Land!
Ming Shao looked at Chen Ping with a sneer, the corner of his mouth slightly raised!
“The Four Ghosts of Ming Mountain, aren’t we still missing one?”
At this point, Lin Chong slowly walked to Chen Ping’s side, addressing the distant Ming Shao!
“What are the Four Ghosts of Ming Mountain?” Chen Ping asked!
“Rumour has it that beneath the Heavenly Demon Mountain lies another range, one that leads to the underworld, called Ming Mountain. The Four Ghosts of Ming Mountain are four demonic cultivators from there.”
“They trained under the same master and are utterly ruthless. I didn’t expect them to have joined the ranks of the Four Ming Mansions.”
Lin Chong explained to Chen Ping!
“The Eight Swordsmen of Demon Mountain, the Four Ghosts of Ming Mountain, it seems the Four Ming Mansions have recruited quite a few powerhouses, haven’t they?”
“No wonder this Ming Shao, young as he is, struts about so arrogantly. Turns out he’s got real strength behind him!”
Chen Ping looked at Ming Shao, only now realising just how formidable the Four Ming Mansions truly were!
“Emperor Lin, are you planning to get involved personally too?”
Seeing Lin Chong standing by Chen Ping’s side, Ming Shao gave a cold smirk!
“I won’t let anyone threaten Mr. Chen, not even your Four Ming Mansions!”
Lin Chong said calmly!
“Fine then, have it your way!” Ming Shao nodded.
Immediately after, yet another old man emerged from the endless black mist beside him!
This old man was also draped in a black robe, but his hands were a vivid blood-red, as though they’d just been soaked in fresh blood!
“Emperor of Sun-Moon City, to fight you is an honour for me!”
With that, the red-clawed old man charged straight at Lin Chong!
Lin Chong leapt forward in response, engaging the red-clawed old man in battle!
Chen Ping glanced around. All the forces behind him were fully committed at this moment!
Ming Shao slowly advanced towards Chen Ping. Each step seemed leisurely, yet he reached Chen Ping’s front in the blink of an eye!
“They say you’re a once-in-a-generation genius of the Celestial Realm, with talent beyond measure. I’d like to test that…”
“But don’t worry, I’ll give you a chance to call for help. If you’ve got anyone else backing you, feel free to summon them all!”
Ming Shao smiled faintly, speaking to Chen Ping with a gentlemanly air!
In that moment, they didn’t seem like enemies at all!
And indeed, they weren’t truly enemies, it was just that Ming Shao couldn’t stand anyone outshining him!
Chen Ping looked at Ming Shao and slowly shook his head. “I won’t call anyone. If I did, your Four Ming Mansions would simply cease to exist!”
Hearing this, Ming Shao couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “That’s quite a bold claim! Even the Sect Leader of the Fire Incineration Sect wouldn’t dare dismiss our Four Ming Mansions so lightly!”
“Do you think our Four Ming Mansions only have the Eight Swordsmen of Demon Mountain and the Four Ghosts of Ming Mountain?”
