This little brat is so infuriating, always sucking on a lollipop and acting all high and mighty!
Especially back in the Xiao Dynasty, that arrogant attitude of his—Chen Ping has never forgotten it.
Today, he’s going to make this little brat truly understand what fear feels like!
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…
Over a dozen arrows shot out in rapid succession. The cultivators of the Tenth Hall were all panicking. Even their Hall Master couldn’t withstand the Divine King’s Bow—how could they possibly survive?
Their faces turned pale, and they immediately unleashed their full power to form layers of protective shields.
But the arrows pierced through the shields effortlessly, quickly striking one of the Tenth Hall cultivators. With a single arrow, the cultivator was instantly reduced to a wisp of smoke, vanishing without a trace—not even a corpse remained. Such was the terrifying power of the Divine King’s Bow!
“Holy crap, this is insane…”
Xuan Bin and the others stared in shock.
The Tenth Hall Master’s son, however, was surrounded by three arrows, his face filled with terror and despair.
“Father, save me, save me…”
The Tenth Hall Master’s son was so scared he nearly wet himself, the lollipop in his mouth falling to the ground.
The Tenth Hall Master frowned, his body instantly turning into a blur as he slammed into the three arrows.
His eldest son was already dead—he couldn’t let anything happen to his youngest!
“Brother-in-law, you focus on dealing with the Tenth Hall Master. As for the small fry, I’ll handle them for you!”
Lin Kefan said, then charged straight toward the Tenth Hall cultivators.
Although Lin Kefan couldn’t defeat the Tenth Hall Master, dealing with these small fry was a piece of cake for him.
Seeing this, Xuan Bin and the others followed Lin Kefan, joining the assault on the Tenth Hall cultivators.
Chen Ping, meanwhile, held the Divine King’s Bow, calmly staring at the Tenth Hall Master.
“I have to get in close to attack!”
Seeing the Divine King’s Bow in Chen Ping’s hands, the Tenth Hall Master began to feel a sense of panic.
He knew that only by closing the distance and engaging Chen Ping in close combat could he prevent Chen Ping from using the Divine King’s Bow.
With this in mind, the Tenth Hall Master instantly turned into a blur, charging straight at Chen Ping!
Boom, boom, boom…
The Tenth Hall Master’s fists rained down relentlessly, giving Chen Ping no chance to catch his breath.
This way, Chen Ping wouldn’t be able to use the Divine King’s Bow.
Seeing this, Chen Ping put away the bow and instead unleashed his Holy Light Fist, trading blows with the Tenth Hall Master.
Explosions rang out continuously around them!
Chen Ping’s body had been strengthened using divine techniques, and with his Indestructible Golden Body, combined with the formations Hua Yueying continuously cast around him, the Tenth Hall Master couldn’t gain the upper hand in a short time.
The Tenth Hall Master grew more and more frustrated. He was a third-grade Immortal Ascension cultivator, a being who could overturn the heavens with a wave of his hand!
Yet now, he couldn’t even subdue a second-grade Great Ascension cultivator.
This was beyond ridiculous—it was downright absurd!
The Tenth Hall Master was utterly humiliated. Chen Ping’s Holy Light Fist was no joke, and his terrifyingly strong body made him a nightmare to deal with.
However, it was also unrealistic for Chen Ping to defeat the Tenth Hall Master in a short time.
After all, the Tenth Hall Master was a third-grade Immortal Ascension cultivator, far surpassing Chen Ping in strength. The fact that Chen Ping could hold his own against him was already impressive.
But Chen Ping wasn’t in a hurry. He had promised Yun Li that he wouldn’t kill the Tenth Hall Master, so all he needed to do was keep him occupied while Lin Kefan and the others wiped out the rest of the Tenth Hall.
Once the Tenth Hall was wiped out, leaving only the Tenth Hall Master, he wouldn’t be able to cause any trouble.
The Tenth Hall Master, of course, knew Chen Ping’s plan, which only made him more anxious.
“Kid, you’ve forced my hand…”
The Tenth Hall Master’s face twisted into a狰狞 expression, and a terrifying aura erupted from his body. At the same time, his entire form began to mutate.
Boom!
The Tenth Hall Master’s aura surged once more!
Chen Ping was slightly stunned, frowning as he muttered, “Aren’t these divine clan members supposed to be human? Why has he turned into a monster?”
“Mr. Chen, be careful! This guy is undergoing beast transformation. He must have fused with beast genes!”
Hua Yueying, seeing this, quickly warned Chen Ping.
