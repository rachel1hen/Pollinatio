The fighting spirit and light had faded from Su Yuqi’s eyes. She knew she was powerless against the fourth-level guardian!
Yun Li watched in stunned silence. Based on Su Yuqi’s performance just now, he knew he’d be no match for her, and if even she couldn’t break through the fourth level, he stood no chance at all!
“Let me take him on…”
Seeing Su Yuqi restrained, an inexplicable anger surged within Chen Ping. Gripping the Dragon-Slaying Sword, he prepared to strike!
“Mr. Chen, let me test the waters for you…”
Li Chunfeng stepped in front of Chen Ping, then addressed the black-robed man, “Fellow cultivator, you…”
“Get lost…”
With a wave of his hand, the black-robed man unleashed a terrifying aura that roared toward Li Chunfeng!
Li Chunfeng reacted instantly, hurling two flying swords!
The terrifying aura was shredded by the swords and dissipated!
The black-robed man faltered slightly before charging at Li Chunfeng!
Li Chunfeng took a step forward, swinging his longsword in a cascade of sword light!
“Slash!”
As Li Chunfeng’s voice rang out, the sword light descended like a bolt from the heavens!
The black-robed man sneered, smashing a fist forward!
Boom!
A deafening explosion erupted, followed by a terrifying shockwave that rippled outward!
Chen Ping immediately activated his Indestructible Golden Body, shielding Su Yuqi!
Shen Zhiyan, seeing this, flicked his sleeve, dispersing the shockwave!
“Are you okay?” Chen Ping asked Su Yuqi!
He didn’t even know why he’d instinctively stepped in front of her, fearing she’d get hurt!
Su Yuqi glanced at him, shaking her head silently without a word!
Ning Zhi, watching this, felt a pang of unease. He feared Chen Ping might recognise Su Yuqi beneath her mask!
If that happened, his plans would crumble!
“You’re not a cultivator from the Celestial Realm?”
The black-robed man asked Li Chunfeng!
“I’m the second-level guardian, not a Celestial Realm cultivator!”
Li Chunfeng replied!
Li Chunfeng replied!
“Where’s the imprisonment seal in your body?” The black-robed man asked in shock!
“Mr. Chen broke it for me!”
Li Chunfeng glanced at Chen Ping!
The black-robed man looked at Chen Ping and sneered, “Are you fooling a three-year-old? He’s just at the Great Ascension Realm, capable of breaking an imprisonment seal? Even if he could, could he withstand the heavenly tribulation?”
“You don’t believe it?” Li Chunfeng asked!
“No!” The black-robed man shook his head.
“Mr. Chen, he doesn’t believe it…” Li Chunfeng turned to Chen Ping helplessly!
“Step back, let me face him. Maybe then he’ll believe!”
Chen Ping unsheathed the Dragon-Slaying Sword and stepped forward!
“Kid, I’m not like the other guardians, I *will* kill…”
The black-robed man said, eyeing Chen Ping!
“If you’ve got the skill, come kill me then!”
With that, Chen Ping swung his Dragon-Slaying Sword!
A dragon’s roar echoed as the sword light transformed into a massive dragon, charging at the black-robed man!
“Hmph!” The black-robed man snorted!
He waved his hand lightly!
But this wave changed nothing in the world around them. The dragon formed by the sword light slammed into the black-robed man!
The black-robed man was sent flying, spitting blood midair before crashing to the ground!
Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi stared in shock!
Both were incredulous, unable to comprehend how Chen Ping had managed to send such a powerful guardian flying with one strike!
Yun Li’s eyes widened, his jaw practically dropping. Defeating the fourth-level guardian in one hit—wasn’t that a bit outrageous?
Li Chunfeng frowned, equally puzzled!
Only Shen Zhiyan seemed to grasp something, subtly glancing upward!
Perhaps the master of this Ladder to Heaven was going easy on Chen Ping!
When he’d fought alongside Chen Ping, his own strength had suddenly been suppressed to a fraction!
“What’s going on? How did this happen?” The black-robed man, stunned and disoriented, demanded!
