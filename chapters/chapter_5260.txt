“Well done!” Seeing this, Fat Woman wasted no time with words, swinging her giant palm to meet the attack.
“Clang!”
The sword and palm clashed, producing an even harsher collision sound, with wild air waves spreading again. This time, many weaker cultivators were directly blown away, and cracks appeared on the walls of the Information Tower.
The two masters instantly locked in combat!
Mo Chen’s swordsmanship was exquisite beyond compare, sometimes agile and graceful, like an antelope’s horns, leaving no trace to follow; sometimes fierce and domineering, like a thunderbolt, unstoppable. Each sword carried profound insights into the way of the sword, making the surrounding Sword Sect disciples’ blood boil with excitement.
Fat Woman’s fighting style was bold and unrestrained, heavy with immense force. Relying on her Earth Immortal cultivation and formidable physique, she met Mo Chen’s sword moves head-on.
Each of her attacks carried overwhelming power, making the air tremble.
The two traded blows, fighting until the sky darkened and the sun and moon lost their light.
Sword light and palm shadows intertwined, with booming sounds echoing endlessly. The tables, chairs, and benches inside the Information Tower were shattered, walls collapsed, and the entire building teetered on the verge of ruin.
The surrounding cultivators had long retreated outside, watching this clash of top-tier masters from a distance, their faces filled with shock.
“Heavens! Is this a duel between peak Earth Immortal masters? It’s terrifying!”
“Senior Mo Chen lives up to his reputation, his swordsmanship is incredible!”
“That Fat Woman is no pushover either, her physical strength is monstrous, taking Senior Mo Chen’s sword moves without a scratch!”
The battle raged on for a long time, just as the rumours suggested, with the two fighting for a full three hundred rounds!
After three hundred rounds, both were panting heavily, bearing wounds.
Mo Chen’s clothes were torn in several places by Fat Woman’s palm winds, and a trace of blood hung at the corner of his mouth.
Fat Woman fared no better, her body marked with several deep, bone-revealing cuts from sword light, blood dripping, her breathing somewhat erratic.
Clearly, this fierce battle had taken a heavy toll on both.
“Mo Chen, your strength is nothing special!” Fat Woman gasped, her eyes glinting with excitement. “Today, let me test the true power of your Sword Sect!”
With that, her aura surged again, clearly preparing to unleash her ultimate technique.
Mo Chen’s expression grew grave, knowing he was nearing his limit.
Fat Woman’s physique was simply too robust; though his swordsmanship was refined, defeating her completely seemed nearly impossible.
“Take my final move! Blood Demon Frenzy!” Fat Woman roared, and the blood from her wounds began to boil, swirling around her body, forming streams of crimson energy.
Her frame seemed to swell slightly, becoming even more terrifying.
“Not good!” Mo Chen’s heart jolted, sensing the terrifying power in this move. He dared not be careless, gathering all his spiritual energy into his longsword, muttering, “Sword Sect secret art, Ten Thousand Swords Return!”
In an instant, countless sharp sword energies erupted from his body, converging in the air into a massive sword shadow, carrying world-shattering might as it slashed towards Fat Woman.
The crimson energy streams and the giant sword shadow collided with a deafening crash!
“Boom!”
A earth-shaking roar echoed, and the entire Sword Saint City seemed to quake.
A violent energy storm spread, levelling the Information Tower to the ground, with surrounding buildings collapsing under the impact.
Dust filled the air, obscuring everyone’s view.
The surrounding cultivators held their breath, staring intently at the centre of the dust, eager to know the outcome of this earth-shaking duel.
After a long while, the dust gradually cleared.
In the arena, Mo Chen and Fat Woman’s figures reappeared before the crowd.
Mo Chen leaned on his longsword, his face pale as paper, blood constantly seeping from his mouth, his aura weakened to the extreme, clearly gravely injured and no longer able to fight.
