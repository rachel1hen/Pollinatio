“Mysterious Lady, the Divine Hall’s people were indeed driven off by Senior Chen, and he even defeated the master of the Eight Halls. We all saw it with our own eyes, it’s no lie.”
The man who brought Chen Ping and the others immediately vouched for Chen Ping.
If he hadn’t seen it himself, he wouldn’t have believed a first-rank Loose Immortal could defeat a fifth-rank Loose Immortal.
“Is this true?” Blue Lotus asked, astonished.
“What the hell are you blabbering about? Did they pay you to deceive us like this?”
“A first-rank Loose Immortal defeating a fifth-rank Loose Immortal cultivator? That’s absolute nonsense.”
The King of Dongmeng Kingdom roared at the man!
The man’s face paled slightly, clearly intimidated by the King of Dongmeng Kingdom.
“What would it take for you to believe it?” Chen Ping asked, looking at the King of Dongmeng Kingdom.
“Of course, let us see it with our own eyes, so we can be convinced,” the King of Dongmeng Kingdom said!
“May I ask, what is your current cultivation level?” Chen Ping inquired.
“I’m at the peak of second-rank Loose Immortal, and soon I’ll reach third-rank Loose Immortal,” the King of Dongmeng Kingdom said proudly.
Slap…
But before he finished speaking, Chen Ping was suddenly in front of him, delivering a resounding slap!
The King of Dongmeng Kingdom was stunned, and as he reacted, he tried to retaliate against Chen Ping!
But he found his body seemed to be bound by something, completely unable to move.
Chen Ping then delivered several more slaps!
Slap, slap, slap…
“Well, do you believe me now?” Chen Ping asked while striking.
This scene left the other two kings dumbfounded.
Blue Lotus gasped, her face full of disbelief.
If she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes, she would never have believed it. Even she couldn’t render the King of Dongmeng Kingdom powerless like this.
Yet Chen Ping, a first-rank Loose Immortal, had done it.
Yet Chen Ping, a first-rank Loose Immortal, had done it.
“Chen Ping, you’re too much! Didn’t we agree to let me handle the showing off?” Hu Mazi said, pulling Chen Ping aside and starting to slap the King of Dongmeng Kingdom himself.
Hu Mazi gave the King of Dongmeng Kingdom another round of heavy slaps.
Neither Chen Ping nor Hu Mazi had a higher cultivation level than him, but in front of these two, he was like a child, without the slightest ability to resist.
“Chen Ping, Master Hu, that’s enough, don’t kill him,” Mo Qingyun said, quickly stepping in to stop them.
By now, the King of Dongmeng Kingdom’s face was swollen like a pig’s head.
The man who brought Chen Ping and the others couldn’t help but cover his mouth and chuckle.
Ashinu laughed unabashedly: “Hahaha, now do you believe it? His face is swollen from the beating.”
Though the King of Dongmeng Kingdom was furious, he began to fear Chen Ping and Hu Mazi’s strength.
Despite their low cultivation levels, their prowess was terrifying.
Truly, one cannot judge a person by appearance, just as one cannot measure the sea with a bucket!
“Qingyun, where did you meet these two experts?” Blue Lotus asked curiously!
“In Feihu City…” Mo Qingyun briefly recounted the events.
Upon hearing this, Ashinu suddenly became excited, grabbing Chen Ping’s hand: “In Feihu City, were you the ones who saved my daughter and my people?”
“Your daughter?” Chen Ping was taken aback.
“My daughter is Aisha…” Ashinu said!
At this, Chen Ping immediately recalled and nodded: “Yes, I was the one who rescued them from Feihu City…”
“Benefactor, thank you so much…” Ashinu said, about to kneel before Chen Ping.
Chen Ping gently lifted his hand, preventing Ashinu from kneeling, which made Ashinu respect Chen Ping even more.
A young man with only first-rank Loose Immortal strength, yet possessing unfathomable power.
Hearing that Chen Ping had also saved many people from Feihu City in Cangxuan Continent, Blue Lotus was filled with gratitude!
