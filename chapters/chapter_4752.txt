The monk, enraged, leapt into the air and lunged towards the old woman!
The old woman stood motionless, smiling calmly as she watched!
Just as the monk was about to seize her, a sudden beam of white light shot forth!
Boom!
The white light pierced through the monk’s body, causing him to explode into thin air!
Flesh and blood scattered everywhere, splattering onto Zuo Tianzheng and his companions.
“Bravo…”
“That was spectacular…”
The villagers of Dashicun, witnessing this, clapped and cheered!
Zuo Tianzheng and his fellow demonic cultivators were dumbfounded. They hadn’t seen where the white light had come from!
“Who’s there? Who’s hiding and playing tricks? Show yourself if you dare!” Zuo Tianzheng shouted, his eyes darting around warily.
“Leader Zuo, it’s been a while!” At that moment, Chen Ping slowly stepped forward.
When Zuo Tianzheng saw Chen Ping, his brow furrowed instantly.
He couldn’t understand why he would encounter Chen Ping in this remote, impoverished mountain village.
Zuo Tianzheng least wanted to run into Chen Ping right now.
“I didn’t expect it to be you…” Zuo Tianzheng glared at Chen Ping, his eyes filled with disdain.
“There are many things you didn’t expect,” Chen Ping replied with a cold smile.
“Chen Ping, we’re here to capture demonic cultivators. Don’t meddle in this affair.”
“Besides, these people aren’t worth your intervention. You’d better stay out of this, and in the future, the Demon-Sealing Alliance will leave you alone.”
Zuo Tianzheng hoped Chen Ping would stay out of the matter.
“Your Demon-Sealing Alliance may not want trouble with me, but I want trouble with the Demon-Sealing Alliance,” Chen Ping said with a playful smirk.
This infuriated Zuo Tianzheng, who retorted coldly, “Chen Ping, don’t think you’re invincible just because you have powerful backing. Our Demon-Sealing Alliance has its own allies, and our influence spans the entire Heavenly Realm. If you want to fight me, you’re digging your own grave!”
“Hahaha, your Demon-Sealing Alliance’s influence spans the Heavenly Realm? I think your alliance is finished!” Chen Ping laughed heartily.
Just as Zuo Tianzheng was about to respond, a blood-soaked member of the Demon-Sealing Alliance rushed over!
Zuo Tian was just about to open his mouth when he saw a cultivator of the Demon Sealing Alliance, covered in blood, rushing in!
“Alliance Master, it’s not good, our Demon Sealing Alliance’s forces in the various domains have all been attacked.”
“Now the people of the Demon Sealing Alliance are dying and descending, all of them are drawing a line in the sand with our Demon Sealing Alliance!”
After that Sealing Demon Alliance cultivator finished speaking, he directly died of gas!
“Impossible, how is this possible, impossible ……”
Zuo Tianzheng’s face was full of shock as he looked at the elder beside him and said, “You contact the Demon Sealing Alliance ministries immediately, I don’t believe this is true!”
Upon hearing this, that elder hurriedly contacted the various ministries of the Demon Sealing Alliance, only to find that they could not be contacted at all!
It was only at this point that Zuo Tianzheng had to believe that his Demon Sealing Alliance was really finished!
“Could it be you? Did you do all of this?”
Zuo Tianzheng looked towards Chen Ping and roared with rage!
“You guessed right, it was indeed me, to exterminate your Demon Sealing Alliance, I only needed one sentence!”
Chen Ping said with a faint smile!
“Hmph, cut the fucking bragging, now that your backer is gone, those of us are fully capable of killing you.”
Zuo Tianzheng coldly snorted and said!
“Want to kill me? You people aren’t qualified enough, I won’t fight you, I’ll let my minions be able to exterminate you!”
Chen Ping laughed!
“Big talk, just with these mountain villagers?”
Zuo Tianzheng said as he swept a glance at those villagers of Bashi Village!
“Alliance Master, don’t talk nonsense with him, I can kill this brat myself, but it’s only a mere second rank of the Mahayana realm, and he dares to be so insolent!”
That elder had no idea of Chen Ping’s power, so he was not afraid of Chen Ping at all!
Zuo Tianzheng glanced at that elder with a look of a fool!
Chen Ping was at the second rank of the Mahayana realm, and he dared to be so unbridled in front of them, and he didn’t think about what it was because of?
“Who was the one who disrespected Mr Chen?”
At this moment, a roar like a flooding bell came out, followed by a vast aura enveloping them!
“Peak 9th rank of the Mahayana Realm?”
Zuo Tianzheng froze!
Immediately afterwards, Xuan Bin’s figure appeared and blocked in front of Chen Ping!
