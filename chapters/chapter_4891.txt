But Ning Zhi didn’t take it in, his eyes gleaming with excitement.
“If we go to the Celestial Realm, can we still come back?” Chen Ping asked!
“I don’t know. Whether you can return depends on your own abilities. If you become the Master of the Universe, you can traverse any universe at will. If you become a True God of the Celestial Realm, you can freely travel between worlds!”
“But with your current strength, surviving in the Celestial Realm will be tough, let alone talking about coming back!”
The boy’s words were harsh, but they were the truth!
Chen Ping felt a bit awkward, then looked at the boy and said, “Thank you, Senior. Since you stayed to guide us, does that mean you’ve prepared a gift for me too?”
“Don’t even try it, I’ve got nothing. My master never gives me anything good.”
With that, the boy’s figure vanished in an instant, likely afraid Chen Ping would keep pestering him for something!
Seeing the boy disappear, Chen Ping smiled, then gazed at the white light of the guiding path, his heart beginning to waver!
He didn’t know whether he should ascend to the Celestial Realm now or stay in the Celestial Human Realm to cultivate for a while longer, reaching the realm of ascension through his own strength!
If he went to the Celestial Realm now, he wasn’t sure if he could return, and Chen Ping didn’t know!
There were still so many people he hadn’t said goodbye to!
And he hadn’t found Su Yuqi yet, Chen Ping felt unwilling to leave!
As Chen Ping stared at the white light, lost in thought, Ning Zhi suddenly gave Su Yuqi a subtle signal!
Su Yuqi abruptly slashed at Chen Ping with her sword!
The blade blazed with flames, and this sudden strike caught Chen Ping completely off guard, leaving him no time to react!
He never imagined that the two who had travelled with him this far would turn on him!
Pfft!
A deep gash was sliced into Chen Ping’s back, blood gushing out instantly, his entire body stumbling and nearly collapsing!
“Brother Ning, what are you doing?”
Chen Ping looked at Ning Zhi, his face full of confusion!
“Chen Ping, I won’t let you ascend to the Celestial Realm, I’m going to kill you!”
Ning Zhi roared, his eyes brimming with rage and murderous intent!
Feeling this killing intent, Chen Ping frowned, “Are you Ning Zhi?”
“Hahaha, that’s right, it’s me…”
Ning Zhi tore off his mask!
Seeing that familiar face, Chen Ping actually smiled, “Even if you’ve injured me, you’re still no match for me!”
“Chen Ping, I might not be able to beat you, but my senior sister can!”
Ning Zhi finished speaking and turned to Su Yuqi, “Senior Sister, get him…”
Without a word, Su Yuqi swung her sword at Chen Ping again!
Chen Ping’s pupils shrank sharply, then he summoned his Dragon-Slaying Sword, unleashing a terrifying sword intent in an instant!
Boom!
The sword intent shattered, and Chen Ping’s body was blasted back in a flash!
Injured as he was, Chen Ping’s strength had weakened considerably!
Seeing this, Ning Zhi’s face twisted into a sinister grin, he had finally waited for this day!
“You’re courting death!”
Chen Ping was furious, his Unbreakable Golden Body slowly enveloping him, waves of terrifying spiritual energy coursing through his veins!
Su Yuqi charged with her sword once more, but this time, Chen Ping remained calm as still water, quietly watching her strike. Then, the Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand erupted with dazzling golden light!
With a dragon’s roar, a golden dragon appeared behind Chen Ping, merging with the sword light as it surged straight towards Su Yuqi!
Su Yuqi’s sword light was instantly shattered, her entire body sent flying backwards!
Chen Ping was right, even injured, they were no match for him!
In the moment Su Yuqi was flung back, Chen Ping leapt forward, his Dragon-Slaying Sword slashing down in one fluid motion!
“Die…”
Even though his opponent was a woman, Chen Ping showed no mercy at this moment!
But just as the Dragon-Slaying Sword was about to cleave Su Yuqi in two, her mask suddenly slipped off!
A face Chen Ping knew all too well, more familiar than any other, appeared before his eyes!
Chen Ping froze, the Dragon-Slaying Sword halting in an instant!
