The golden divine soul clearly hadn’t expected Chen Ping to unleash such a rogue. It froze for a moment before roaring in anger, “How dare you! I am the ancestor of the Barbarian Clan, how dare a demon like you defile me!”
“Ancestor?”
Red Cloud Demon Lord scoffed, circling the divine soul before suddenly pointing at a crack in its battle armour and laughing loudly, “I thought you were some big shot, but turns out you got your armour cracked by a kick from that demon clan sow next door?”
“Tch, how embarrassing. If word got out, where would your ancient clan’s face be?”
The divine soul trembled with rage, its golden light surging, the totem shadows around it quivering, “You… how do you know?!”
“I know a lot!”
Red Cloud Demon Lord’s eyes widened as he leaned closer, a thick wave of demonic qi washing over the divine soul, “With your pathetic state, you call yourself an ancestor? Believe it or not, I could piss you to death with a single splash?”
“Who the hell are you?” The Barbarian Clan ancestor stared at Red Cloud Demon Lord in growing fear.
“I am Red Cloud Demon Lord…” Red Cloud Demon Lord declared his name slowly.
“Red Cloud Demon Lord?”
The Barbarian Clan ancestor’s eyes widened in shock.
“What? You know me?” Red Cloud Demon Lord asked.
“Of course! Thousands of years ago, you slaughtered tens of thousands of immortals in a single battle in the Ninth Heaven. Who doesn’t know you?”
The Barbarian Clan ancestor flattered Red Cloud Demon Lord.
Hearing this, Red Cloud Demon Lord scratched his head, a bit embarrassed, chuckling, “A hero doesn’t dwell on past glories. I’m just a strand of divine soul now, my physical body long destroyed.”
“Since you know me, give me some face. Let my little brother take all your treasures. Your Barbarian Clan is already wiped out, so what use does a divine soul like you have for all this stuff?”
Red Cloud Demon Lord’s words shattered the Barbarian Clan ancestor’s mental defences. He hadn’t expected his clan to already be eradicated.
Looking at the unmasked mockery and threat in Red Cloud Demon Lord’s eyes, and then at Chen Ping’s faint, amused smile, the ancestor realised he was up against a tough opponent.
He knew that if he didn’t agree, even this strand of divine soul wouldn’t survive.
“Fine, the treasury is yours, but I hope you won’t touch my clan’s foundational heritage. When I reconstruct my body, I can still revive the Barbarian Clan!”
With that, the Barbarian Clan ancestor turned into a streak of golden light, vanishing into a stone tablet deep in the treasury, silent thereafter.
Chen Ping glanced at the departing ancestor, then at the smugly posing Red Cloud Demon Lord, and couldn’t help but smile.
“Senior, your reputation is quite something!” Chen Ping flattered.
“Of course! I was invincible below the Ninth Heaven!”
Red Cloud Demon Lord laughed proudly.
With a thought, Chen Ping recalled Red Cloud Demon Lord’s divine soul back into his sea of consciousness.
“Oi, what’s wrong with letting me stay out a bit longer?” Red Cloud Demon Lord grumbled.
“I’m worried your divine soul might get damaged if exposed too long. It’d be troublesome if you couldn’t reconstruct your body!” Chen Ping explained.
At that, Red Cloud Demon Lord fell silent.
Chen Ping waved his hand, and countless natural treasures, technique manuals, and ancient spiritual artefacts were instantly stored in his ring.
What thrilled him most was a “Chaos Spiritual Root” embedded in a chaos stone, and a tattered scroll of the *Barbarian Body Refining Art*, exuding an ancient aura. The body-refining techniques recorded within were countless times superior to those of the ancient body-refining clans in the Celestial Realm.
“With this refining art, my physical body will grow even stronger!” Chen Ping stored the *Barbarian Body Refining Art*, then turned his gaze to the Chaos Spiritual Root.
The root was clearly still growing, and the immortal qi around it was noticeably denser.
