“Why is that?” Chen Ping asked, utterly confused!
“If you go challenge him now, that person’s at their peak strength. Wait until others have challenged him first, then it’ll be the easiest time!”
The old man explained!
Chen Ping smiled. No matter how tough the first tier’s challenge was, with his strength, it’d be a breeze!
“Fellow cultivator, don’t laugh. Are you thinking that since our world is so barren, there are no strong fighters here, and you can win easily?”
The old man asked!
Chen Ping nodded, not denying it!
“You’re wrong. The one you need to challenge isn’t from our world. He arrived here not long ago.”
“When this person showed up, we knew the heavenly calamity was about to begin.”
“This might be the last time. Our world is probably doomed to be destroyed!”
The old man gazed at the barren wasteland, speaking with deep emotion!
“Why’s that?” Chen Ping was stunned!
“It’s obvious. Our world was chosen as a testing ground. Once this trial ends, our purpose is fulfilled, and there’ll be no need for this world to exist anymore.”
“To those mighty beings, our world is just a speck of dust…”
Tears welled up in the old man’s eyes as he finished!
Chen Ping fell silent, unsure how to comfort him!
“Enemy attack…”
Suddenly, someone shouted loudly, and all the townspeople leapt into the air in a panic!
Women and children stayed behind, hiding in their homes!
In the distance, two black dots rapidly approached, soon hovering above the town!
Both cultivators were at the eighth level of the Transcendence Realm!
To the townsfolk, these two were insurmountable powerhouses!
“Damn, this godforsaken place has no resources left. Finally found a town with people.”
“Big brother, let’s loot it and see if we can snag anything!”
The two said, descending toward the town!
The town’s cultivators moved to stop them!
But the pair ignored them. One casually waved his hand, and a terrifying aura crashed down from the sky!
The town’s cultivators tumbled to the ground, powerless to resist!
The gap in strength was too vast!
The two landed in the town. One sneered, “Hand over all your resources, and we might spare your lives!”
The other chimed in, “And send over a few beauties to let us brothers have some fun!”
The town’s cultivators glared at them in fury, but no one dared speak!
“You two pieces of trash, does bullying the weak feel good?”
At that moment, Chen Ping walked slowly into the town’s central street alongside the old man!
“Who the hell dares talk to us like that?”
One cursed, turning to see Chen Ping!
When the two spotted him, their faces turned pale!
To the townsfolk, they were supreme powerhouses!
But to Chen Ping, they were mere ants!
The pair recognized him. They’d been in the crowd at the Dao Sect, witnessing Chen Ping kill the Spirit Sect Leader and the Tang Sect Grand Elder!
“Mr… Mr. Chen, didn’t expect you to be here!”
The two cultivators trembled in fear.
“You’re just here to train and pass the trial. Why harm lives? The resources these people have are useless to you anyway!”
“Get lost, and stop bullying the weak!”
Chen Ping waved them off!
The two nodded frantically and fled without looking back!
Seeing this, the townsfolk dropped to their knees before Chen Ping!
The old man was stunned too. He hadn’t expected Chen Ping to be so formidable that even those from the heavenly calamity feared him!
“Fellow cultivator, please, save our lives!”
The old man knelt as well!
