“Be your servant?” Chen Ping sneered, “If I let you be my servant, I’d still find your strength lacking, a mere fifth-rank Earth Immortal, you’re nothing!”
Chen Ping wasn’t boasting. In the Heavenly Ladder, the people he saved; Nan Batian, Li Chunfeng, Shen Zhiyan, Mu Sha were all stronger than this Black Bear Daoist!
“Oh? Quite the bragger, are you?” A ferocious grin spread across Black Bear Daoist’s face, “Then don’t blame me for being rude!”
In a flash, his massive fist tore through the air with a whistling sound, smashing towards Chen Ping.
The aura of a fifth-rank Earth Immortal pressed down like a mountain, making it hard for Chen Ping to breathe.
Chen Ping felt a tremendous force hit him, his arm went numb, and he was forced back repeatedly, blood trickling from his mouth.
“Seventh-rank Loose Immortal? Not bad, kid, surviving my punch,” Black Bear Daoist said, surprised, but his expression quickly turned disdainful, “But in front of me, you’re still too weak.”
He charged again, his fists raining down on Chen Ping like a storm.
Chen Ping could barely defend himself, quickly falling into a disadvantage, new wounds appearing on his body.
Hu Mazi wanted to help but was pinned down by Black Bear Daoist’s aura, unable to approach.
Just as Chen Ping was about to collapse, a booming voice rang out, “Black Bear Cub, bullying my benefactor, Nan Batian? Did you ask me first?”
Before the voice faded, a towering figure descended like a meteor, standing in front of Chen Ping. The man was nearly three metres tall, muscular, with a defiant grin, it was Nan Batian!
Black Bear Daoist’s face turned ugly at the sight, “Why are you here?”
Nan Batian scoffed, “The Fifth Heaven is vast, I go where I please. Do I need to report to you?”
He turned to Chen Ping with a warm smile, “Mr. Chen, long time no see. Are you alright?”
Chen Ping looked at Nan Batian, shock and gratitude filling his heart, “Nan Batian? How… how are you here? And your strength…”
He could sense that Nan Batian’s power had reached the peak of seventh-rank Earth Immortal, far stronger than when they were in the Heavenly Ladder.
Back then, Nan Batian’s strength was suppressed in the Heavenly Ladder, with no resources to cultivate.
Nan Batian laughed heartily, “It’s a long story. After leaving the Celestial Realm, I came to the Fifth Heaven and have been cultivating. Didn’t expect to run into you so soon, Mr. Chen.”
“Your strength has grown fast too, still fighting above your rank as always, so impressive, reaching the Fifth Heaven as a Loose Immortal.”
“Embarrassed, embarrassed, I almost got killed just now!” Chen Ping said sheepishly.
Nan Batian turned to Black Bear Daoist, his face turning ice-cold, “Black Bear Cub, what were you about to do to Mr. Chen?”
Nan Batian, a seventh-rank Earth Immortal, was calling Chen Ping “Mr. Chen” and seemed to know him well.
Now, Black Bear Daoist didn’t think Chen Ping’s earlier words were just bragging.
“Nan Batian, don’t mess around! I’m the lord of Black Wind Ridge, backed by…” Black Bear Daoist retreated, eyes full of fear.
“Backed by your mum, it’s no use!” Nan Batian cut him off, flashing forward and sending Black Bear Daoist flying with a single punch.
