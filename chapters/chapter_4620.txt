Although Zhong Li had not appeared, the invisible sword intent had caused the surrounding air to freeze, as if even time had stopped for it.
When Qiu Tu saw this, his face suddenly changed. He knew that the sword spirit enlightenment means, that is not only the power of the sword multiplied, it is the extension of the will of the sword master, is the embodiment of the perfect fusion of the sword and the person.
Although he himself also had a sword spirit, in comparison, it seemed to be lacking a certain ineffable flavour.
“Hmph, so what even if it is a spirit sword, today I, Qiu Tu, will definitely chop you here!”
Qiu Tu shouted angrily, the spiritual energy of his entire body surged wildly, the spiritual sword behind him also emitted a deafening dragon roar, the runes on the sword body flashed, a powerful sword intent surged out like a tidal wave, rushing straight into the clouds.
Seeing this, the corner of Chen Ping’s mouth hooked up into a cold smile, and the Dragon Slashing Sword was violently raised, the tip of the sword pointing straight up to the sky.
An even more majestic sword intent erupted from within his body, colliding fiercely with Qiu Tou’s sword intent in the air, forming a brilliant sword light that dyed the entire sky with a multicoloured hue.
“Sword intent duel, let’s see whose sword is sharper and whose will is stronger!”
Chen Ping’s voice echoed in the sword light, and the light on the Dragon Beheading Sword became more and more dazzling.
The figure of the Sword Spirit Zhong Li was finally fully visible, holding a long sword and engaging in a fierce exchange with Qiu Tu’s Sword Spirit in the void.
The two great sword spirits, one majestic and ancient, the other harsh and domineering, their every collision was accompanied by a deafening roar, as if they were going to tear apart this heaven and earth.
Between the flashes of sword light, sword intent was rampant, and each sword blade contained power that was enough to destroy mountains and rivers.
Shock and unwillingness were written all over Qiu Tu’s face.
He had originally thought that with his cultivation of the Fifth Grade of the Mahayana Realm and the might of his Spirit Sword, he would be able to easily crush Chen Ping, yet reality had dealt him a heavy blow.
The strength of Chen Ping’s sword intent and the might of his sword spirit were far beyond his expectations.
“How is this …… this possible!”
There was a hint of despair in Qiu Tu’s voice, he could feel that as the battle continued, his own sword intent was rapidly depleting, while Chen Ping seemed to be endless, each attack becoming more and more powerful.
You have to know that Chen Ping in the Refining Sect’s Sword Washing Pool, but absorbed countless sword intent, if purely compared to the sword, this Qiu Tou is still almost meaningless!
Qiu Yu on the side had long been scared to death and was too shocked to speak.
He had originally thought that with his brother’s help, he could easily avenge his hatred, yet the sight before him made him completely despair.
He had never seen such a terrifying battle before, and he had never thought that Chen Ping would be so powerful.
“Big brother …… save me ……” Qiu Yu’s voice had a sobbing tone in it as he tried to ask Qiu Tu for help, but in this fierce sword intent duel, Qiu Tu simply had no time for him.
Finally, after a violent collision, Qiu Tu’s sword spirit was split away by Zhong Li’s sword, and the originally brilliant runes on the sword body also became dull.
Qiu Tu’s face instantly turned pale, this sword spirit was something he had spent countless hours cultivating, almost like his own child.
Now, it was directly killed by Zhong Li, and the spirit sword that was originally incomparably sharp, at this moment, because of the disappearance of the spirit of the sword, it had also turned into an ordinary long sword!
“You destroyed my spirit sword, I must have you die ……”
Qiu Tu hissed loudly as he held the longsword that had become very ordinary in his hands.
Even though the longsword had become ordinary, Qiu Tui raised it up high, the blade reflecting the light and refracting the coldness of a morose aura!
Only to see the flame breath rushing around Qiu Tu, his body slowly levitated!
Along with the breath within Qiu Tintu’s body exploded to its peak, directly taking the long sword in his hand out of his hand!
Even without the sword spirit, at this moment, Qiu Tu’s long sword unexpectedly burst out a white light, followed by turning into ten, a hundred!
