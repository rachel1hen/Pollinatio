“Old sir, please get up.” Chen Ping helped the old man to his feet, then traced a formation pattern in the air with his hand. Instantly, the entire town was enveloped in golden light!
“Old sir, I’ve set up a defensive formation around the town. If danger comes, as long as you stay inside, no one can harm you!”
Chen Ping said!
“Thank you, thank you…” The townsfolk expressed their gratitude one after another!
“Old sir, I want to take on the challenge. Can you tell me where the one to be challenged is?”
Chen Ping asked!
The old man pointed southwest and said, “It should be in that direction. It’s a man wielding a giant axe, nearly a hundred meters tall.”
With this valuable information, Chen Ping didn’t linger and headed straight southwest!
At that moment, Chen Ping spread out his divine sense, searching for the aura of the man the old man described!
After all, someone chosen as the challenge target couldn’t be too weak, or it’d be pointless!
Soon, Chen Ping locked onto an area and descended!
He cautiously scanned his surroundings!
Rumble…
Suddenly, the ground shook violently, the whole earth trembling!
Chen Ping quickly leapt into the air, looking down to see a deep chasm splitting the ground. Then, a man wielding a giant axe slowly emerged!
The man’s clothes were tattered, like a beggar’s, and he stood a hundred meters tall with a terrifying aura!
He looked up at Chen Ping, grinning, “Third-grade Transcendence Realm, and you dare be the first to challenge me? You’ve got guts…”
“I’ve been stuck in this godforsaken place with no resources. Might as well take some from you.”
Chen Ping stared at the man, his expression turning grim!
“Damn, is the first tier this insane? How did the others pass it?”
Chen Ping frowned, utterly perplexed!
Even the sisters Hong Yao and Lan Yao had cleared the first tier. How did they defeat this towering monstrosity?
“Kid, this is my first time too. I don’t know how the others passed!”
The man said, then swung his axe fiercely at Chen Ping!
“Crap!” Chen Ping was stunned. So the challenges in the Heavenly Ladder changed every time!
As the man’s axe came down, the heavens and earth seemed to explode, the force utterly terrifying!
Chen Ping had no way out. Unless he gave up on reaching the second tier, he had to defeat this guy!
Now, he could only face it head-on.
Chen Ping summoned the Dragon-Slaying Sword and blocked the man’s axe strike!
Boom!
With a deafening crash, Chen Ping’s body was flung back a thousand meters, his hands numb!
He stared at the man in shock, disbelief written across his face. Was the first tier really this strong?
Was it deliberately targeting him?
Chen Ping steadied himself, gripping the Dragon-Slaying Sword tightly, a hint of gravity in his eyes.
He took a deep breath, spiritual energy surging wildly within him as the sword glowed brilliantly.
Facing this hundred-meter-tall giant wielding a massive axe, he knew he couldn’t afford the slightest carelessness in this fight.
“Come again!” Chen Ping shouted, his body flashing like lightning as he charged at the man.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword sliced through the air, unleashing a sharp sword aura aimed straight at the man’s chest.
The man grinned, swinging his giant axe horizontally, whipping up a fierce wind that clashed with Chen Ping’s sword aura.
In a thunderous explosion, the heavens seemed to tear apart, shockwaves rippling outward, cracking the ground once more.
Chen Ping was pushed back dozens of meters but didn’t retreat. Instead, the fighting spirit in his eyes burned brighter.
He felt the man’s terrifying power, yet within it, he caught a trace of a mysterious rhythm.
Each swing of that giant axe seemed to carry a hint of the laws of heaven and earth, stirring a faint realization in his heart.
