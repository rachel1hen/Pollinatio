This time, Elder Chu became anxious!
Although his strength was good, he couldn’t carry it in the face of so many demonic cultivators attacking him!
What’s more, these were all characters of the Demon Sect’s Sectmaster, and there were many whose strength was not below his!
Elder Chu was dying of anger inwardly, it was all because of this Zuo Xuan’s blind beeping, and this pissed off all these devil cultivators!
Moreover, this bit of their Demon Sealing Alliance’s secret has been exposed!
“Sovereign Kong, what are you guys doing? The Heavenly Demon Mountain can’t have private fights during this period of time, no matter what race, but you guys set that up.”
“Now do you guys want to break the rules? If you break the rules, you guys have to think about it, there are more than just you devil cultivators in the Heavenly Demon Mountain now.”
“At that time, with so many people cultivators, and the Beast Race, how are you going to explain yourselves, there will definitely be a big mess.”
“And if you kill our male son, at that time, the alliance masters will definitely put their best efforts to surround the Heavenly Demon Mountain, at that time, there will be another large number of casualties, could it be that you are planning to ruin it after so many years of rest and recuperation?”
Elder Chu said to Patriarch Kong!
At the same time, these words were also said to the other demonic cultivators, after all, these demonic cultivators had found a place like the Heavenly Demon Mountain, recuperating with no one to disturb them, it was already very good!
If they really killed Zuo Xuan, I’m afraid that the Heavenly Devil Mountain, this piece of pure land of the devil race, will also disappear!
Patriarch Kong fell silent, and the other devil cultivators also fell silent!
A moment later, Patriarch Kong said, “You all leave the Heavenly Demon Mountain immediately, you are not welcome to enter the Divine Demon Battlefield of the Heavenly Demon Mountain.”
“Okay, we will leave right away ……,” Elder Chu said, pulling that Zuo Xuan and leaving!
When out of the Xuan Yin Sect, Chu Elder’s forehead has long been a cold sweat, and that Zuo Xuan is still a little unconvinced, “Why can’t we enter the Divine Demon Battlefield, I still want to pick up the treasure!”
“There’s also that Chen Ping, is it possible to just let him go?”
Elder Chu helplessly glanced at Zuo Xuan, just now he was about to piss his trousers, he didn’t dare to let out a single fart, now that he had left the Xuan Yin Sect, he was yelling!
If it wasn t for Zuo Xuan playing the big tail wolf, they wouldn t have become what they are now.
“My lord, that Chen Ping can just be intercepted at the place where he left the Heavenly Demon Mountain, it’s impossible for him to stay in the Heavenly Demon Mountain all the time.”
“I am willing to stay in the Xuan Yin Sect and observe that Chen Ping’s movements, and report back to Your Excellency when the time comes.”
Elder Fei hurriedly proposed at this moment!
When Zuo Xuan heard this, he immediately nodded, “Good, let’s do it, you keep an eye on that Chen Ping, and these demonic cultivators from the Heavenly Demon Mountain, I’ll bring someone to exterminate them sooner or later.”
Elder Fei left happily, he couldn’t leave, he had eaten Chen Ping’s poison pill, if he couldn’t find a way to make Chen Ping detoxify, he was going to die!
“Gongzi, let’s go ……”
Elder Chu led Zuo Xuan and walked towards the outside of the Heavenly Demon Mountain!
………………
Inside the Divine Demon Battlefield!
Chen Ping looked at an immortal grass in front of him, and his entire body froze!
This was because this immortal grass was just too big, taller than Chen Ping, it was about to become a tree!
And there were also a few fruits on it, and the spiritual qi flowed above the fruits, crystal clear, compared to the immortal grass outside, I don’t know how many times stronger it was!
If this immortal grass is used to refine pills, the efficacy can definitely be ten times stronger, a hundred times stronger ……
Chen Ping reached out and grabbed the Immortal Grass, then fiercely exerted his force to pull it down and put it into his storage ring!
However, just after Chen Ping had touched the immortal grass, the entire immortal grass suddenly went towards the ground and instantly disappeared into the ground!
Chen Ping was stunned and looked towards the ground, he didn’t understand how this immortal grass came to life and even drilled away towards the ground by itself!
Chen Ping probed with his divine sense, his face instantly changed, followed by the fire of anger burning in his eyes!
The Demon Drawing Whip appeared in Chen Ping’s hand and fiercely lashed towards the ground!
