Long Qi stepped down, casting a cold glance at Chen Ping, his eyes brimming with fury and hatred.
“You wait, kid…”
Long Qi left with his entourage!
Chen Ping, unfazed by Long Qi’s threat, turned to the crowd below and said, “Anyone else want to try?”
The crowd exchanged glances, but for a moment, no one dared to step up.
The big man locked eyes with the blue-eyed man, then leapt onto the platform.
“I’ll give it a go…”
The big man addressed Chen Ping!
He knew that with war soldiers patrolling the city, it would be difficult to make a move against Chen Ping. But if he could kill Chen Ping on the stage, it would be deemed Chen Ping’s misfortune, and he could claim the storage pouch on Chen Ping’s body.
Chen Ping glanced at the big man, then shook his head, “You’re not my match, better not try.”
“How will we know without trying?”
With that, the big man swung a fist at Chen Ping’s face, a lethal move aimed to take his life.
Chen Ping frowned slightly, “You want to kill me?”
He could tell the big man intended to kill him.
“Exactly, hand over all your immortal coins, and I might spare you.”
The big man dropped all pretence, stating it outright.
“So, you’re after my immortal coins, but to get them, you’ll need real skill.”
With that, Chen Ping threw a punch!
Boom!
Their fists collided, and the big man staggered back, his entire arm drooping instantly.
“You…” the big man exclaimed in shock, “How does someone your size have such physical strength?”
“None of your business…”
Chen Ping launched a kick.
Boom!
The kick landed squarely on the big man, sending him flying off the platform like a kite with a broken string!
The array was still active, preventing the big man from using any magical aura.
Thus, he could only watch helplessly as he plummeted from the platform.
The crowd gasped in shock, no one expecting the big man to be defeated in a single move.
As his body crashed heavily into the ground, creating a deep crater, he was reduced to a pulp, dead beyond doubt.
Instantly, silence enveloped the surroundings!
Everyone was incredulous, as if in a dream.
The big man’s size was more than double Chen Ping’s, and pure physical strength was typically proportional to size.
Who could have imagined that Chen Ping’s frail frame could unleash such terrifying power!
The blue-eyed man merely glanced at the dead big man and left without looking back.
Chen Ping leapt down from the platform, the ten matches concluded, rendering staying on stage pointless.
All eyes were on Chen Ping, on his mere Immortal Transformation Realm First Grade, unable to believe such a level could possess such formidable physical strength.
“Let’s go…” Chen Ping collected his winnings and said to the stunned Xiu Rui.
Chen Ping and Xiu Rui returned to the inn, where Hu Mazi was still occupied, seemingly tireless.
But shortly after Chen Ping returned to his room, there was a knock at the door.
Chen Ping was puzzled, wondering who could be looking for him, as he had just arrived in Rhino City and knew no one.
When he opened the door, he found an old man, short in stature, dressed in a grey cloth robe, his frame remarkably frail compared to the tall, robust people of Rhino City.
“Who are you looking for?” Chen Ping asked.
“You…”
The old man gave a faint smile and, without waiting for an invitation, walked straight into Chen Ping’s room.
Chen Ping was somewhat displeased with the old man’s peculiar behaviour, after all, this was his room, and the old man had entered uninvited, which was quite rude.
