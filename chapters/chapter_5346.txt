Entering the gate, one finds a spacious courtyard. In the centre of the courtyard stands a huge bronze bell, its body engraved with densely packed runes. This is the treasure of Thunder Sound Temple, the Thunder Sound Bell.
However, at this moment, the runes on the Thunder Sound Bell appear somewhat dim, clearly indicating that something is amiss.
An old Taoist in a white robe, with white hair and a youthful face, walks out from the main hall. His gaze is piercing, and he exudes the pressure of Earth Immortal Realm Ninth Grade. He is none other than the master of Thunder Sound Temple, Daoist Wuji.
“Chen Ping, you have arrived.” Daoist Wuji smiles as he steps forward. “I have been waiting here for quite some time.”
Daoist Wuji knows that Chen Ping and his companion would definitely come. With the matters in the Fifth Heaven resolved, Chen Ping could not stay in the Fifth Heaven forever.
Chen Ping quickly clasps his hands in salute. “Daoist, how did you know I would come to the Sixth Heaven?”
“The Six Halls of the Divine Temple are in the Sixth Heaven, so of course you would come. Moreover, your cultivation speed means you cannot stay in the Fifth Heaven forever, because the higher you go, the more resources there are, which are more beneficial to your cultivation.”
“Besides, haven’t you always wanted to know your father’s identity? I’m afraid you won’t be able to inquire about your father’s identity or understand the secrets of the Heavenly Realm from back then until you reach the peak of the Heavenly Realm!”
Daoist Wuji says with a smile.
Regarding Chen Ping, Daoist Wuji still understands him well. This fellow would never be content with the status quo.
After hearing this, Chen Ping can only give a faint smile. “It’s still the Daoist who understands me…”
“Nonsense, if I didn’t understand you, could I betroth Ting’er to you?”
“But you rascal, in the future, stop fooling around with women. All that bloodline yang energy on you has been sucked away by women.”
Daoist Wuji glares at Chen Ping and says!
Chen Ping, on the other hand, is full of embarrassment and no longer speaks.
Hu Mazi bursts into loud laughter. “This guy always calls me lecherous, but actually, the women he plays with are far more than mine. He’s like an animal, either playing with women or on the way to play with women, and he plays with all young girls.”
“The ones I play with are all mature women, never picky…”
“Master Hu, stop talking…” Chen Ping’s face turns red!
Seeing Chen Ping blush, Daoist Wuji joins Hu Mazi in laughing heartily!
Hu Mazi glances at the Thunder Sound Bell in the courtyard. “Daoist, this bell seems a bit off, doesn’t it?”
Upon hearing this, Daoist Wuji looks at the Thunder Sound Bell, sighs, and shows a trace of solemnity on his face. “Fellow Daoist Hu has good eyesight. To be honest, Thunder Sound Temple has indeed encountered a thorny issue recently. Three days ago, the Thunder Sound Bell was stolen.”
“What?” Chen Ping and Hu Mazi are shocked at the same time.
The Thunder Sound Bell is the treasure of Thunder Sound Temple, capable of countering evil arts, and it was actually stolen?
Daoist Wuji leads the two into the main hall, where they sit as host and guests. A young Taoist boy serves spiritual tea.
Daoist Wuji sips the spiritual tea and slowly says, “This Thunder Sound Mountain appears ordinary, but it is actually a sealing ground.
In the belly of the mountain, ten thousand demon souls are suppressed. These demon souls committed numerous evils back then and were jointly sealed here by the ancestors of our Thunder Sound Temple.
The Thunder Sound Bell is the key to suppressing the demon souls.
Every hundred years, the Thunder Sound Bell must be struck. The bell’s sound, containing thunder-type spiritual power, can strengthen the seal, preventing the demon souls from escaping.”
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi exchange a glance, both seeing shock in each other’s eyes.
Ten thousand demon souls, if they all break out, the Sixth Heaven will surely be plunged into misery and suffering.
“Then, Daoist, do you know how the Thunder Sound Bell was stolen? Any clues?” Chen Ping asks with a frown.
Daoist Wuji shakes his head, his expression solemn. “On the night three days ago, the disciples on duty suddenly heard a strange wind sound. Immediately after, the Thunder Sound Bell emitted a humming sound, with lights flashing.
By the time they rushed to the bell pavilion, the Thunder Sound Bell had already disappeared. The scene only left some strange footprints, like those of some demon beast, but carrying demonic energy. We pursued for a long time, yet found no clues.”
