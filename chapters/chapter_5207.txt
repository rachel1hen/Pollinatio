Returning to the Black Demon Palace, Youyue was already waiting in the main hall.
Seeing Chen Ping and Hu Mazi return safely, a flash of surprise crossed her eyes, quickly replaced by calm.
“You two have indeed lived up to expectations, successfully retrieving the treasure.”
Youyue said with a smile, “What reward would you like?”
Chen Ping tossed the demon core to Youyue, saying coolly, “No need for rewards, we only hope you’ll keep your promise and help investigate the truth behind the Hu clan’s annihilation.”
Youyue caught the core, a glint of greed flickering in her eyes before she concealed it, “Rest assured, I’ll keep my word.
However, investigating the truth takes time. Stay in the palace for now and wait for my news.”
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi exchanged a glance and nodded.
They knew that while Youyue had agreed to help, she wouldn’t reveal the truth so easily, they’d need to wait patiently.
Settling into the Black Demon Palace, Chen Ping focused on cultivation, healing his injuries while processing the gains from the Demon Burial Abyss.
The Hu clan’s ancestral talisman teachings greatly benefited him, deepening his understanding of talisman arts and significantly boosting his strength.
Hu Mazi, meanwhile, spent his days studying the clan’s ancient texts and the patriarch’s token, hoping to uncover more secrets about the Hu clan.
Thus, the two stayed in the Black Demon Palace, awaiting Youyue’s news.
Unbeknownst to them, a greater crisis was quietly approaching.
The days in the Black Demon Palace were eerily calm.
Youyue seemed to be honoring her promise, not only making no further demands but also sending healing pills and cultivation resources, her respectful attitude raising suspicions.
Chen Ping’s injuries had fully healed under the nourishment of the Heart Condensation Technique, and the ordeal had refined his spiritual energy even further, bringing him just a step away from the seventh rank of the Loose Immortal Realm.
Besides cultivating, he wandered the palace daily, appearing casual but secretly probing its inner workings.
One day, while passing a rockery in the palace’s back garden, he overheard a hushed conversation from behind it.
“…Is the Demoness really letting those two humans go? That demon core is the key to breaking through your bottleneck!” a hoarse voice said.
“Why the rush?”
It was Youyue’s voice, laced with a cold smile, “Those two humans survived the Demon Burial Abyss, so they must have extraordinary qualities.
Especially that Chen Ping, his strength is unfathomable. Instead of making an enemy of him, it’s better to win him over for now.
Once I refine the demon core and break through to the fourth rank of the Earth Immortal Realm, it won’t be too late to deal with them.”
“But… that Hu clan kid is already investigating the annihilation. What if he finds something?”
“So what if he does?”
Youyue snorted coldly, “The events back then were handled with utmost secrecy. Even if he finds a clue, there’s no evidence.
Besides, he’s under our control now, he can’t stir up any trouble.”
“That puts me at ease. By the way, several factions around Jiupan Mountain are getting restless, seemingly eyeing the treasures of the Demon Burial Abyss. Should I send someone to deal with them?”
“No need.”
Youyue said calmly, “Let them stir up trouble, it’ll be a good test of those two humans’ strength.
If they can handle those factions, all the better, if not, their deaths will save us the effort.”
The voices behind the rockery faded, and Chen Ping quietly emerged, a cold glint in his eyes.
As expected, Youyue had no intention of letting them go from the start, her promise to investigate the truth was merely a stalling tactic.
He returned to their quarters and shared what he’d overheard with Hu Mazi.
