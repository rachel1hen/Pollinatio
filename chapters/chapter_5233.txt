“Let you, this witch, taste the power of my Demon-Whipping Lash!” Chen Ping said, putting away his Dragon-Slaying Sword and directly taking out the Demon-Whipping Lash!
The Demon-Whipping Lash cracked through the air, and Youyue felt as if her divine consciousness was being forcibly stripped away!
The Witch Youyue’s heart was filled with fear; this Demon-Whipping Lash was too shocking for her.
She knew that today, the Black Fiend Demon Palace was likely doomed.
Gritting her teeth, she suddenly ran towards the depths of the Black Fiend Demon Palace: “Father, save me!”
Chen Ping frowned and immediately gave chase.
“Even if you call for your ancestors today, it won’t help!”
Nan Batian also followed in pursuit.
Hu Mazi was close behind.
Deep within the Black Fiend Demon Palace, in a gloomy hall, an old man in a black robe slowly opened his eyes.
He was Youyue’s father, the Palace Master of the Black Fiend Demon Palace, You Wuji, whose strength had reached the fifth rank of the Earth Immortal Realm.
In the Fourth Heaven, the fifth rank of the Earth Immortal Realm was already among the top experts, fully capable of venturing into the Fifth Heaven!
However, You Wuji worried that handing the Black Fiend Demon Palace to his daughter would be unmanageable, as the elders were also unconvinced, so he stayed in the palace to cultivate.
“Who dares to cause trouble in my Black Fiend Demon Palace?”
You Wuji’s voice boomed like a great bell, carrying a powerful pressure.
Youyue ran to You Wuji, sobbing: “Father, you must stand up for me! Chen Ping and his group have stormed in, and our disciples have suffered heavy casualties!”
You Wuji’s face instantly darkened: “Chen Ping? You have some nerve, causing trouble in my Black Fiend Demon Palace. Who are you? Do you have a master backing you?”
In You Wuji’s view, for Chen Ping to dare cause trouble in their palace, he must have a master or a force supporting him, otherwise he wouldn’t dare!
At that moment, Chen Ping, Nan Batian, and Hu Mazi rushed in.
Seeing You Wuji, Chen Ping sneered coldly.
This guy was only at the fifth rank of the Earth Immortal Realm, a far cry from Nan Batian’s peak seventh rank; there was no need to fear him!
Looking at the black-robed old man before him, Chen Ping’s lips curled into a mocking arc, the Demon-Whipping Lash in his hand still trembling slightly, carrying the lingering aura of demonic energy.
“Fifth rank of the Earth Immortal Realm?”
He scoffed, his eyes filled with undisguised contempt, “I thought the Black Fiend Demon Palace was hiding some earth-shattering figure, but it’s just an old fool cowering behind his daughter.
When your daughter was crying for help earlier, why didn’t you show up? Could it be that you’re so old, even moving is a struggle?”
You Wuji’s face turned ashen, his fingers under the black robe clenching tightly.
Having lived for thousands of years and being renowned in the Fourth Heaven, when had he ever endured such humiliation?
Especially from a mere seventh-rank Loose Immortal; this was an utter disgrace!
“Arrogant brat, enough with your sharp tongue!”
You Wuji roared, his body instantly enveloped in thick black mist, “Today, I’ll show you the uncrossable chasm between an Earth Immortal and a Loose Immortal!”
“Chasm?”
Chen Ping raised an eyebrow, deliberately puffing out his chest, “You can’t even protect your own daughter, hiding in your lair like a coward, and you dare talk about a chasm? I bet your fifth-rank Earth Immortal status was piled up with pills, wasn’t it?”
“Courting death!”
You Wuji was thoroughly enraged, his black robe suddenly swelling like an inflated balloon, five pitch-black claw shadows tearing through the air, carrying a corrosive, malevolent aura as they lunged at Chen Ping’s face.
This move, “Nether Ghost Claw,” was his signature technique, which even third-rank Earth Immortals could hardly withstand.
Nan Batian moved to step forward, but Chen Ping raised a hand to stop him.
“Stay out of this!” Chen Ping’s eyes gleamed with burning battle intent, “This guy is perfect for me to test my skills. I’ve been advancing too quickly lately and haven’t had anyone to spar with.”
