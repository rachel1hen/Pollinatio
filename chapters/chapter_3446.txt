The two demonic cultivators simply didn’t have time to react, and their bodies were directly chopped in half by that sword blade!
The two demonic cultivators’ eyes were wide open, their faces full of shock!
Looking down at their bodies that had been lazily chopped off, they finally collapsed!
Until their deaths, they did not understand how Chen Ping, a Transition Realm 1st Grade cultivator, managed to kill two of their Transition Realm 3rd Grade cultivators with a single sword!
This was not scientific!
The girl, seeing that Chen Ping had managed to kill two demonic cultivators with a single sword, was also staring with wide eyes, her face full of incredulity!
Bai Qian, on the other hand, walked to Chen Ping’s side with a smile on her face, “I didn’t expect your heroic rescue pose to be quite handsome, the words you said just now, are they true?”
“What words?”Chen Ping froze!
“You said that we are all your women ah, do I count too?”
Bai Qian came to Chen Ping’s side and asked as she kept throwing winks!
“Let’s go, it will be dark in a while ……”
Chen Ping did not want to answer Bai Shao!
Although he had slept with Bai Shan many times after her, it was just a transaction, there were no feelings!
They were just a deal for each other’s benefit!
“Master, what about this girl?”
Fire Phoenix asked to Chen Ping!
Chen Ping glanced at the girl, and the girl also knew that Chen Ping was the boss here, so she rushed to Chen Ping, “Brother, please, don’t leave me behind, please ……”
The girl grabbed Chen Ping’s arm, her eyes full of prayers!
Chen Ping did not say anything, he was not a great benefactor, in this God and Demon Battlefield it was for the purpose of treasure hunting, bringing one more person would be one more liability!
The girl saw that Chen Ping didn’t say anything, so she said through her tears and gritted her teeth, “Brother, please, you just don’t leave me behind, let me do whatever you want, I can give you my body ……”
When Chen Ping heard this, his scalp went numb, he was going to be tossed to death by Bai Shallow during this period of time.
“I am not the Goddess of Mercy, and your body is of no use to me, but if you are able to take out other treasures of the right value, I can consider taking you.”
Chen Ping said to the girl!
The girl looked at her own body and looked embarrassed, “I followed my father and got separated, I don’t have any treasures with me ah, but if you are able to take me to find my father, my father will definitely repay you.”
“I am a person from the Sheng family in Fancheng, my name is Sheng Jiahui …………”
“Fancheng Sheng family?Your father is Sheng Tiantai?”
Bai Shao hurriedly asked when she heard this!
Sheng Jiahui nodded and looked at Bai Shao somewhat strangely, “I wonder how sister knows my father ah?”
“Your Sheng family is most famous for its arts and talismans, and it’s also well-known in the entire Southern Region, I didn’t expect you guys to have entered the Divine Demon Battlefield as well.”
“What happened to those two devil cultivators just now?And why did you follow your father to separate?”
Bai Shao asked curiously!
“I followed my father and the Grand Elder and the others to this mountain range, and my father said that this mountain range was shrouded by a huge spell formation, so we needed to separate to find where the spell formation was weak.”
“I followed my brother to this place, but I didn’t want to encounter a demonic cultivator, I ran apart after my brother and ended up meeting you guys.”
Sheng Jiahui said truthfully!
“This mountain range is indeed a spell formation, it seems our guess was not bad!”
As soon as Bai Shao heard Sheng Jiahui’s words, she counted!
“Brother and sister, you guys sent me to find my father, my father will definitely thank you heavily, please ……”
Tears began to flow from Sheng Jiahui’s eyes again!
Bai Qian did not dare to make a decision either, and could only look at Chen Ping!
“Alright, you follow us ……”
Chen Ping nodded and agreed, Sheng Jiahui saw this and hurriedly broke into tears!
But just as Chen Ping and the others were about to leave, suddenly a middle-aged man, with a sinister look on his face jumped out!
The man glanced at the corpses of the two demonic cultivators on the ground, and said with ruthless eyes, “You guys killed two of my brothers and still want to leave, no way ……”
