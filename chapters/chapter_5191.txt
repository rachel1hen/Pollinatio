He could clearly sense the faint, yet undeniable killing intent emanating from Chen Ping, no mere jest.
At that moment, Youyue spoke slowly, her voice as clear and cold as jade, yet carrying an odd, penetrating quality, “Stand down.”
The middle-aged man’s face flickered between pale and flushed, the excruciating pain from his severed arm nearly causing him to collapse.
Yet, faced with the Witch’s command, he gritted his teeth, shot Chen Ping a venomous glare, and staggered to the side, clutching his wound and channelling demonic energy to staunch the bleeding.
Only then did Youyue turn her gaze to Chen Ping. Her deep purple eyes, like an endless starry sky, studied him with a mix of curiosity and gravity.
In the instant Chen Ping had struck, even she hadn’t fully caught his movements, only glimpsing a flash of golden light before the middle-aged man’s arm hit the ground.
This man was, after all, a second-grade Earth Immortal, a formidable figure even within the Black Fiend Demon Palace.
“A sixth-grade Loose Immortal with such combat prowess, you’ve surprised me,” Youyue said, her red lips parting slightly, her tone betraying neither joy nor anger.
“Just average, I haven’t even used my full strength!” Chen Ping said humbly.
But in Youyue’s eyes, this humility was nothing short of blatant bravado.
Hu Mazi, watching from the side, was dumbfounded. He’d already thought Chen Ping’s slaying of a first-grade Earth Immortal elder was impressive, but to sever the arm of a second-grade Earth Immortal demon cultivator with a single move, this strength was downright terrifying.
He tugged at Chen Ping’s sleeve, whispering, “This Witch seems like trouble. Should we quit while we’re ahead?”
Chen Ping didn’t turn, merely glancing around with his peripheral vision.
When Youyue had appeared, the spatial fluctuations were unusually intense, suggesting she’d mastered some advanced spatial technique. Deep within Nine Coiled Mountain, he sensed several auras no weaker than Youyue’s, indicating the Black Fiend Demon Palace’s strength far exceeded what was visible.
Youyue pondered for a moment before saying, “There may indeed be a misunderstanding. How about this, come with me to the Black Fiend Demon Palace to discuss. I’ll have someone investigate the Hu clan’s claims. If this truly was your ancestral land, my palace will provide an explanation.”
Hu Mazi and Chen Ping exchanged a glance and nodded.
“Fine, we’ll go with you,” Hu Mazi said.
Youyue gave a slight smile and turned to lead the way deeper into the mountain.
Following Youyue into the depths of Nine Coiled Mountain, Chen Ping and Hu Mazi soon arrived before a towering black palace.
The palace, crafted entirely from obsidian, exuded a chilling aura. Demonic energy swirled around it, and faint, eerie wails echoed, as if countless tormented souls were trapped within.
“This is the Black Fiend Demon Palace?”
Hu Mazi frowned, “Back when my clan lived here, it wasn’t this sinister.”
Youyue replied calmly, “The demon clan’s cultivation methods differ from humans’, so the environment naturally varies.”
With a wave of her hand, the palace gates slowly opened, releasing a thick wave of demonic energy.
Chen Ping’s expression remained unchanged, but Hu Mazi couldn’t help but shiver.
Just then, four cultivators armed with long spears and clad in black armour suddenly charged out from the palace!
A massive black net shot forth, enveloping Chen Ping and Hu Mazi!
Hu Mazi flinched, while Chen Ping’s brow furrowed, his face darkening.
Youyue’s expression also turned grim, but before she could speak, an elder slowly descended the palace steps, accompanied by none other than the one-armed middle-aged man!
“Two puny humans dare…” the middle-aged man sneered at Chen Ping and Hu Mazi.
But before he could finish, a flash of golden light streaked through the air, and his head flew off!
The black net that had encased Chen Ping and Hu Mazi lay shattered, unnoticed until now. Chen Ping, gripping his Dragon-Slaying Sword, said coldly, “I can’t stand people posturing in front of me!”
