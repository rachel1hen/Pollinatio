For the next few days, Chen Ping, while recovering from his injuries, engaged in deep conversations with Fat Lady.
Fat Lady explained the sinister technique in detail to Chen Ping, including every intricacy.
Chen Ping discovered that this evil technique was indeed extraordinarily domineering. It forcibly devoured external immortal energy, even one’s own life force, to transform it into ferocious power, thereby rapidly enhancing strength.
The body’s ** was precisely due to its inability to withstand the erosion of this ferocious power, causing cellular and meridian distortions.
Drawing on his own knowledge and inspiration from ancient texts, Chen Ping began to diligently study a method to counteract it.
He found that the key to this evil technique lay in “devouring” and “ferocity.” If he could find a gentle force to neutralise that violent energy and guide it to flow in reverse, it might gradually repair the damaged body.
He compiled a long list of medicinal ingredients, all of which were extremely rare treasures of heaven and earth, some even on the verge of extinction.
Without hesitation, Fat Lady immediately mobilised all her connections and resources, sparing no expense to search for them.
Nan Batian stayed by Fat Lady’s side throughout, and the rift between them gradually dissolved in their shared anticipation.
A few days later, all the ingredients were finally gathered.
In a secret chamber of the Information Building, Chen Ping set up an elaborate and complex formation for Fat Lady.
“Fat Lady, Building Master,” Chen Ping said gravely, “the process ahead may be very painful, as it requires guiding spiritual energy to flush your meridians in reverse to neutralise the power of the evil technique. Moreover, once it begins, it cannot be interrupted, or the consequences will be dire. Most importantly, if successful, the strength you’ve gained over the years through the evil technique will significantly diminish, possibly returning to the level before you practised it, or even lower. Are you sure you want to proceed?”
Fat Lady glanced at Nan Batian, who stood nearby with eyes full of concern and encouragement, and gave a resolute smile: “I’m sure! Strength can be regained through training, but to reclaim my true self and be worthy of him, that’s enough!”
Nan Batian stepped forward, tightly grasping her hand: “A Cui, no matter what you become, I’ll never leave you again.”
Tears streamed down Fat Lady’s face once more, but this time, they were tears of happiness.
She took a deep breath and sat cross-legged in the centre of the spirit-gathering formation: “Mr. Chen, begin!”
Chen Ping nodded and activated the formation. Instantly, dense immortal energy converged from all directions, surging into the formation.
With both hands forming seals, Chen Ping guided the immortal energy along the carefully calculated path, slowly infusing it into Fat Lady’s body.
Fat Lady immediately let out a pained groan.
As the gentle spiritual energy entered her body, it clashed fiercely with the ferocious power generated by the evil technique.
Her body began to tremble violently, veins bulging beneath her skin, as if she were enduring immense torment.
Nan Batian watched anxiously from the side, unable to help, only clenching his fists tightly and silently cheering her on.
Chen Ping remained fully focused, not daring to be the least bit careless.
He continuously adjusted the amount and direction of the immortal energy, carefully guiding the fusion and neutralisation of the two forces.
Time passed slowly, and the atmosphere in the secret chamber grew increasingly tense.
One hour, two hours, three hours…
When the first ray of sunlight on the second day filtered through the cracks of the secret chamber, a miracle finally occurred.
The ferocious aura emanating from Fat Lady gradually subsided, replaced by a gentle and pure spiritual energy fluctuation.
Her once excessively bloated body began to shrink at a visible rate!
The excess fat gradually disappeared, her skin became firm and smooth, and her features, previously obscured by flesh, slowly emerged, becoming clear and gentle.
