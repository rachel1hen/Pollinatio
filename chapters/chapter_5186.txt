Hu Mazi chuckled, “Alright, lad, let’s venture into the Fourth Heaven and make a name for ourselves!”
Chen Ping took one last glance at Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun, then resolutely turned and charged towards the passage with Hu Mazi.
“I’ll definitely come back for you!” Chen Ping’s voice echoed across the square.
As their figures vanished into the passage, Huo Jingjing could no longer hold back, tears streaming down her face.
Mo Qingyun gently patted her shoulder, her eyes filled with anticipation.
Inside the passage, spatial turbulence raged, relentlessly battering Chen Ping and Hu Mazi’s bodies.
They channelled their spiritual energy to withstand the onslaught, swiftly flying towards the other end of the passage.
After an unknown amount of time, a glimmer of light appeared ahead.
Chen Ping’s eyes lit up, and he accelerated, rushing out of the passage alongside Hu Mazi.
They landed on unfamiliar terrain, taking a deep breath.
The immortal aura here was dozens of times richer than in the Third Heaven. The sky was a deep azure, with towering peaks in the distance piercing the clouds, where powerful demonic beasts could faintly be seen weaving through the forests.
Chen Ping surveyed his surroundings, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes.
The laws of heaven and earth in the Fourth Heaven were far more refined than those in the Third Heaven, and a powerful pressure permeated the air, making him feel a slight strain.
“This place feels so familiar…” Hu Mazi remarked with a sigh.
“No surprise there, you’re originally a cultivator from the Sixth Heaven. You ascended step by step from the Fourth Heaven, so of course it feels familiar,” Chen Ping said, exasperated.
Then, Chen Ping suddenly remembered that the Wuji Daoist was an immortal from the Fourth Heaven, wondering if they might cross paths.
“It’s been so many years, I wonder how my clan is doing?” Hu Mazi sighed softly. Having undergone multiple reincarnations, he was unsure of his clan’s fate.
“Since we’re in the Fourth Heaven, why not visit your clan? Do you still remember where they are?” Chen Ping asked.
“I think I have some recollection!” Hu Mazi nodded.
“Then let’s go…” Chen Ping was eager to meet Hu Mazi’s clan, hoping to gather some information about the Fourth Heaven.
The astral winds of the Fourth Heaven were several times fiercer than those of the Third Heaven. As Chen Ping and Hu Mazi flew through the air, their robes fluttered loudly.
Below, the forest surged like waves, with massive demonic beasts occasionally poking their heads out, only to retreat hastily upon sensing the spiritual fluctuations from the two.
Monks capable of flying at such heights in the Fourth Heaven were not beings they could provoke.
“It should be around here…” Hu Mazi stroked the short beard on his chin, his brows furrowed, “Back then, my clan lived in a place with nine connected peaks, shaped like a coiled dragon, hence called ‘Nine Coiled Mountains.'”
“But along the way, all I’ve seen are lone peaks, not a single proper mountain range.”
Chen Ping flew beside Hu Mazi, his gaze sweeping over the sprawling mountains below, “You’ve reincarnated too many times, so it’s normal for your memories to be fuzzy. Perhaps the landscape has changed, or some great power concealed it with a secret technique.”
As they spoke, a foul wind suddenly rose from the dense forest below, and seven or eight blood-red jackals with wings shot into the sky, their fangs dripping with viscous venom, clearly targeting them as prey.
Each of these jackals had the cultivation of the Ninth Grade of the Loose Immortal Realm, making them formidable creatures in the outer regions of the Fourth Heaven.
“Noisy!” Chen Ping’s eyes turned cold, and his Dragon-Slaying Sword hummed on its own, unleashing a golden sword aura that swept outwards.
With a squelch, the sword aura sliced through, cutting the blood-red jackals into pieces before they could even scream. Their foul blood rained down onto the forest, causing a stir below, but no other demonic beasts dared to show themselves.
Hu Mazi smacked his lips, “That sword of yours is getting sharper. Back in my day…”
“Enough, enough,” Chen Ping quickly waved his hand, “Save your glorious tales for when we find your clan. If we don’t find any clues after half a day of flying, we’ll need to find someone to ask for directions.”
