The Lion King also let out a roar, his body’s aura exploding, ready to strike at any time!
This time, both sides were instantly at swords drawn, and they were about to make a move!
“Lion King, don’t be impulsive!”
The Thousand-faced Demon King still had his senses, he knew that if they fought, they would definitely be at a disadvantage, maybe all four of them would have to hang up here!
So he stopped the Lion King from impulsively striking!
“Patriarch Luo, if you have something to say, we’ll just go with you ……”
The Thousand-faced Demon King hurriedly said!
Seeing this, Patriarch Luo then turned to that Hai Da Fu and said, “Patriarch Hai, since they are willing to go with us, don’t make a move ……”
Hai Da Fu snorted coldly and withdrew his breath!
Although the Lion King was unconvinced, there was nothing he could do, after all, he really couldn’t beat the people from the five great clans!
“Thousand-faced Demon King, let’s go ……”
Patriarch Luo said!
The four Thousand-faced Demon King could only follow Patriarch Luo as they travelled to the five great sects!
The Five Great Clan Sect was within a depression south of the Heavenly Demon Mountain, and to get to the Five Great Clan Sect from the Heavenly Demon Mountain, one had to pass through the Sheng Family’s Fan City!
Originally, this area of the five great sects was a barren land!
Later, the five great sects opened here, this place also became prosperous!
The five sects are located in the five elements of the eight trigrams, the distance is not far, each other have a care!
And in the centre of the five great sects, there is a tall building made of stone!
This was the central hub of the five great sects, and the five great sect masters would usually meet here!
The Thousand-faced Demon King and the others were brought within the tall building, and were then watched intently by the five great sect lords!
“Patriarch Luo, now that we’ve been brought to the land of your five great sects, isn’t it time to tell us exactly why we were brought here?”
The Thousand-faced Demon King asked at Patriarch Luo in displeasure!
But before Patriarch Luo could speak, Hai Dafu opened his mouth and said, “What are you pretending for, why were you brought here, aren’t you clear in your own hearts, and what did you do in the Divine Demon Battlefield, don’t you understand in your own hearts?”
Hai Dafu’s words caused the Thousand Faced Demon King several people to feel puzzled, not knowing what it meant!
“Sovereign Hai, what did we do in the Divine Demon Battlefield?”
The Thousand-faced Demon King asked in confusion!
“Pretend, just pretend, I’ll see how long you pretend.”
Hai Dafu snorted coldly!
“Hai Da Fu, if you have something to f*cking say, if you can’t, then kill us, you guys are outnumbered, we’ll admit it.”
“But if you can’t tell us the reason and hold us casually to shame, believe it or not, we’ll put our best foot forward and start a beast tide, we’ll also die with you five great sects ……”
The Lion King glared and said loudly!
Seeing the Lion King’s defiant look, Hai Dafu was about to open his mouth, but he was stopped by Patriarch Luo, and then said, “Thousand-faced Demon King, the Five Sons of Human Jie of our Five Great Clans, you guys know each other, don’t you?”
“Recognise, the Five Sons of Human Jie are the most promising disciples selected by your five great sects, how could I not recognise them!”
The Thousand-faced Demon King said!
“Good, since we know each other, it’s good to talk about it, our Human Jie Five Sons entered the Divine Demon Battlefield and died in it.”
Patriarch Luo said!
“What does dying inside have to do with us?Could it be that you suspect that we killed the five sons of the Human Jie?”
The Thousand-faced Demon King frowned!
“It’s not a suspicion, it’s you who killed them, you helped that Chen Ping kill our Human Jie Five.”
“That Chen Ping, alone, couldn’t possibly be a match for the Five Sons of the Human Jade, so a few of you fellows from the Three Emperors and Four Kings helped and killed our Five Sons of the Human Jade.”
Hai Dafu huffed!
“Hai Dafu, you’re spitting blood, what evidence do you have to say that we helped Chen Ping kill your Manjie Five?”
The Lion King retorted!
This matter was not a small matter, it had to be clarified before it could be done, and the Lion King knew the status of the Five Sons of the People’s Jie amongst the five great sects!
