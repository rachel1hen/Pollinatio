“Even with the best physique, no one could withstand ten thousand female cultivators. Even if Chen Ping went, he’d be drained dry.”
“Don’t be fooled by how fierce he was with the two of us, but with that many women, he’d be done for!”
Mo Qingyun chuckled slyly.
Chen Ping gave a wry smile. He was human, not a beast. Even a beast couldn’t handle ten thousand female cultivators.
Moreover, these Blood Shadow Palace female cultivators fed on men’s pure yang essence. Forget ten thousand, enduring ten or eight would already make someone exceptional!
At that moment, before the Blood Shadow Palace, hundreds of female cultivators stood in strict formation.
They all wore red gauze dresses, their skin faintly visible, yet each held a sharp blade, their eyes brimming with killing intent.
“Who goes there!”
The leading elder female cultivator shouted sternly.
Hu Mazi performed a graceful flip in the air, landing steadily on a boulder in front of the Blood Shadow Palace’s gate.
He snapped his fan shut and bowed with clasped hands, “This one is Hu Mazi, here to pay a visit to your Saintess.”
“Hu Mazi?”
The elder female cultivator frowned, “Never heard of you. Leave at once, or else…”
“Or else what?”
Hu Mazi suddenly flashed a wicked smile, reopening his fan and giving it a gentle wave.
In an instant, a white mist appeared out of nowhere, filling the air with a sweet fragrance.
Before the Blood Shadow Palace disciples could react, they felt dizzy and weak in their limbs.
“How dare you pull such tricks? What is this?” the elder female cultivator cried out in alarm.
“Heh heh heh, this is my Thousand Illusion Soul-Bewitching Incense. Smells nice, doesn’t it?”
“Thousand Illusion Soul-Bewitching Incense?” The elder female cultivator was horrified, “Form the array! Hold your breath!”
But it was too late. Dozens of disciples already had glazed eyes, their weapons clattering to the ground.
Their faces flushed unnaturally, and they began to sway uncontrollably.
“You… you despicable scoundrel!” The elder female cultivator struggled to shout, her legs weakening, forcing her to lean on her sword for support.
Hu Mazi chuckled, “Just a little something to liven things up. Don’t worry, it won’t kill you.”
“Besides, don’t you lot cultivate by seducing men and absorbing their pure yang energy?”
“I’m just the opposite, I cultivate by absorbing women’s pure yin energy.”
Hu Mazi’s smile seemed utterly sinister to these female cultivators.
They were used to toying with men at will, but now a man had turned the tables on them.
Watching from a distance, Chen Ping raised an eyebrow, “This old guy’s got some tricks up his sleeve.”
“I thought he charmed women with his personality…”
Huo Jingjing’s expression was odd, “Does he do this kind of thing often?”
Chen Ping glanced at Huo Jingjing and reassured her, “Don’t worry, Master Hu knows his limits. He wouldn’t touch my women.”
Just as Hu Mazi was about to make his next move, a cold snort echoed from within the Blood Shadow Palace, “What filthy rat dares to cause trouble at my Blood Shadow Palace!”
The voice wasn’t loud, but it pierced the sky like a sharp sword. The female cultivators affected by the incense shuddered, their eyes regaining some clarity.
Hu Mazi looked up to see a red figure drifting down from the highest point of the palace.
Her figure was graceful, and with each step, a blood-red lotus bloomed beneath her feet, carrying her gently downward.
When she landed, everyone could see her clearly: willow-leaf eyebrows, phoenix eyes, skin as smooth as jade, and lips like a dab of vermilion.
Her red gauze dress clung to her body, somehow more alluring than if she wore nothing at all.
“The Saintess…” Yun Wuya whispered, instinctively stepping back.
The Saintess’s gaze swept over Hu Mazi, then to Chen Ping’s group in the distance, before settling back on Hu Mazi, “So it’s you, using such underhanded methods against my Blood Shadow Palace disciples?”
“Who are you?” Hu Mazi asked.
“I am the Saintess of the Blood Shadow Palace!” she declared.
