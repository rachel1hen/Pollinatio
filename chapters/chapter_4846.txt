The sword’s blade shimmered with flowing runes, a faint dragon’s roar echoing from it, clearly a peerless divine weapon.
In contrast, Chen Ping didn’t do as Fusheng expected by drawing his famed Dragon-Slaying Sword.
Instead, he closed his eyes, his aura slowly gathering. In his palm, a faint white glow began to take shape.
Within that light pulsed an endless edge, the very sword intent he’d refined.
Fusheng’s face darkened at the sight, feeling Chen Ping’s move was a blatant insult.
“Chen Ping, what’s this supposed to mean? Is pulling out your Dragon-Slaying Sword beneath you or something?”
“You’re facing me with this flimsy sword intent? Do you look down on me, Fusheng?”
Fusheng roared, his voice reverberating through the air, laced with resentment and fury.
He’d seen Chen Ping wield the Dragon-Slaying Sword before and knew it was a matchless divine blade, yet here Chen Ping was, refusing to use it against him!
Chen Ping opened his eyes slowly, a flicker of amusement in them, and said unhurriedly, “You guessed it, I do look down on you.”
“For a fight with you, this sword intent’s plenty. Bringing out the Dragon-Slaying Sword would be overkill, and winning that way wouldn’t feel fair.”
Chen Ping’s tone was calm, but his words landed like a boulder in a still lake, sending shockwaves through everyone’s minds.
“What an arrogant little sod!”
Fusheng, thoroughly provoked, swung his treasured sword, unleashing a fierce sword qi slashing towards Chen Ping.
Where it passed, the very space tore open with a black rift, like a snarling python lunging straight at Chen Ping.
Chen Ping remained unruffled, casually raising his right hand and giving a light flick with the palm brimming with sword intent.
In an instant, the sword intent morphed into a white ribbon of light, meeting Fusheng’s oncoming sword qi head-on.
When the two clashed in midair, there was no earth-shaking boom as expected, just a brief deadlock.
The white ribbon tangled and collided with the black sword qi, sending faint ripples of energy scattering outwards.
Where they spread, rocks on the ground crumbled to dust, and nearby trees were sliced clean through, their branches and leaves swirling in the air.
“Hmph, let’s see how long your sword intent holds up!”
Fusheng snorted, pouring more spiritual power into his attack. The black sword qi swelled, growing thicker and sharper, gradually overpowering Chen Ping’s white ribbon.
But Chen Ping didn’t flinch, the corner of his mouth lifting into a confident smirk.
With a soft shout, “Break!”
The white ribbon flared brilliantly, a colossal force erupting from it, shattering Fusheng’s black sword qi into pieces.
And it didn’t stop there, the shockwave barreled on towards Fusheng.
Fusheng’s face twisted in alarm as he hurriedly brandished his sword, forming a defensive shield of sword qi in front of him.
But the lingering might of Chen Ping’s sword intent was too overwhelming.
“Bang!”
With a deafening crash, the sword qi shield shattered, and Fusheng flew backwards like a snapped kite string, tumbling dozens of metres before barely stabilising himself.
A trickle of blood seeped from his mouth, his eyes brimming with shock and disbelief.
“How… how can your sword intent be this strong?”
Fusheng muttered, staring at Chen Ping with a mix of awe and, for the first time, a hint of fear.
Not far off, Ming Shao watched the scene unfold, the smile vanishing from his face, replaced by a grim look.
“This Chen Ping’s no pushover. Seems he’s grown a lot in just a month,” Ming Shao murmured.
The red-haired old man beside him looked tense, glancing at Ming Shao cautiously, “Ming Shao, Fusheng’s down. Should I step in now?”
Ming Shao paused, then shook his head, “Hold off, let’s keep watching.”
