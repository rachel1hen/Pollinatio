The stench of blood in the ruins of the Seventh Hall had not yet dissipated when the Seventh Hall Master ordered a secluded stone chamber to be cleared.
The chamber’s walls were inlaid with rare Calming Jade, capable of faintly suppressing spiritual fluctuations, ideal for healing.
“Chen Ping, these are the last three ‘Soul-Stabilising Pills’ in my Seventh Hall. They’re remarkably effective for stabilising the soul. Please take them.”
The Seventh Hall Master held a jade box with both hands, his attitude bordering on subservience.
Having witnessed the terror of a Ninth Heaven soul, he harboured no trace of his former hostility towards Chen Ping.
Huo Jingjing helped Chen Ping sit, her brows furrowed as she eyed the spreading black aura on his chest. “This demonic energy is ferocious. Could it harm your foundation?”
Chen Ping waved a hand, storing the Soul-Stabilising Pills in his storage ring. “No matter. Senior Crimson Cloud’s power is intense, but restrained. My body just can’t handle it for now.”
His fingertip brushed his brow, a barely perceptible golden light flickering as the faint shadow of the Demon-Suppressing Tower rotated slowly within him.
“I need to enter seclusion for a few days. Please, Seventh Hall Master, look after this place.”
Before his words settled, a faint golden halo enveloped Chen Ping, and he gradually sank into the ground.
The Calming Jade-inlaid stone walls trembled violently as an ancient tower shadow rose from the earth, completely engulfing his figure.
“This… an independent space within a magical treasure?”
The Seventh Hall Master gasped, staring at the now-smooth stone floor, his eyes filled with astonishment.
Connecting a treasure’s space to the earth’s veins was a technique far beyond the understanding of Third Heaven cultivators.
Inside the Demon-Suppressing Tower, a different scene unfolded.
Countless immortal stones and spiritual veins filled the tower, alongside immortal herbs and various spiritual treasures, all plundered by Chen Ping from vanquished sects.
“Damn old devil, using such domineering power. Is he trying to tear my body apart and rebuild it?”
Chen Ping gritted his teeth, circulating his technique to repair his body.
As the Soul-Calming Technique activated, waves of immortal energy surged into him.
Three days and nights passed quietly.
Outside the stone chamber, Huo Jingjing, Mo Qingyun, and Hu Mazi stood guard, never leaving.
The Seventh Hall Master visited daily, bringing healing elixirs that filled half the room, even offering his prized “Mysterious Ice Jade Essence.”
“Sister Jingjing, do you think Chen Ping will be alright?”
Mo Qingyun rubbed her palms, her face full of worry.
She couldn’t forget Chen Ping’s terrifying demonic form, its world-destroying pressure haunting her sleepless nights.
Huo Jingjing stared at the sealed stone door, her gaze resolute. “He’s not the kind to fall easily.”
Yet her clenched fists were damp with cold sweat.
Inside the Demon-Suppressing Tower, Chen Ping was undergoing a transformation.
*Crack…*
An invisible shackle seemed to shatter, and the violet-gold energy in Chen Ping’s body surged threefold, his aura rushing towards the tower’s peak.
The barrier of the Fifth Rank Loose Immortal shattered, and surging spiritual energy coursed through his meridians, settling deep in his energy sea, marking a qualitative leap in his strength.
Sixth Rank Loose Immortal!
Chen Ping slowly opened his eyes, a flash of violet-gold light vanishing from his pupils.
He spread his palm, a wisp of violet-gold energy dancing at his fingertips, causing faint ripples in the air upon contact.
“This is the power of the Sixth Rank Loose Immortal?”
He murmured, feeling an unprecedented fullness within.
The wounds previously eroded by demonic energy had scabbed and fallen away, leaving only a faint scar, enveloped in violet-gold energy that faintly radiated warmth.
Most of the immortal stones in the Demon-Suppressing Tower dimmed, as if their purpose was fulfilled.
Chen Ping stood, stretching his muscles, his bones emitting a series of crisp cracks, every inch of his body brimming with explosive power.
At the Sixth Rank Loose Immortal, Chen Ping’s unleashed strength was enough to contend with Earth Immortal cultivators.
