He roared, turning and charging at one of the warriors, his fist smashing down fiercely once more.
At the same time, Lady Meixin giggled seductively as she lunged forward, her blood-red bell shaking frantically, countless blood-coloured sound waves weaving into a vast net, enveloping the other warrior and Chen Ping.
The old Taoist Xuanzhi stood at a distance, lightly tapping his dragon-headed staff, causing countless golden runes to appear in the void, forming a massive Bagua diagram that encased Chen Ping and the two warriors, clearly intent on trapping them.
In an instant, three peak ninth-grade Loose Immortal experts struck simultaneously, their coordination seamless, suppressing Chen Ping and the two warriors utterly.
The Savage King of Cracked Mountain’s berserk strength relentlessly battered the warrior’s body, producing thunderous “thud thud” sounds.
Lady Meixin’s blood-coloured sound waves infiltrated every gap, attempting to dismantle the warriors’ defences.
The old Taoist Xuanzhi’s Bagua diagram steadily constricted, limiting their movement.
Chen Ping, while fending off attacks, also had to counter the old Taoist’s formation assaults, plunging him into a desperate struggle.
Wounds multiplied across his body, blood staining his clothes red, yet his eyes grew ever brighter, his Dragon-Slaying Sword swinging faster, each strike carrying an unstoppable sword intent.
“Chen Ping!”
Mo Qingyun, outside the barrier, was so anxious that tears streamed down her face, pounding futilely against the runic barrier, unable to help.
She could only watch helplessly as Chen Ping fought bloodily against the three powerhouses, “Hold on! You must hold on!”
The rogue cultivators in the distance watched, dumbfounded, having never witnessed such a brutal battle.
A fourth-grade Loose Immortal, enduring so long against three ninth-grade Loose Immortal powerhouses, and even summoning two formidable war puppets, utterly shattered their understanding.
“This… what kind of monster is this Chen Ping? Fourth-grade Loose Immortal! Even an ordinary ninth-grade Loose Immortal would be instantly killed facing three ninth-grades, right?”
“Terrifying! That sword in his hand, and those two war puppets, they’re no ordinary things! The treasures of ancient ruins are probably far more heaven-defying than we imagined!”
“Look, he’s injured, but his eyes show no fear, only growing fiercer! Does this kid still have a trump card?”
Just as Chen Ping began to falter, with cracks appearing on the two warriors, a glint of ruthlessness flashed in the old Taoist Xuanzhi’s eyes, and he said gravely, “It’s time, end it!”
He slammed his dragon-headed staff down, the Bagua diagram erupting in blinding golden light, countless runes transforming into sharp swords shooting towards Chen Ping.
The Savage King of Cracked Mountain and Lady Meixin also intensified their attacks, the Savage King shattering a warrior’s shoulder with a punch, while Lady Meixin’s blood-red bell emitted a piercing shriek, causing the other warrior to freeze momentarily.
“Not good!”
Chen Ping’s heart jolted, and at the critical moment, he gritted his teeth, a flash of resolve in his eyes.
He knew if he didn’t play his trump card now, he’d truly perish here today!
“Senior! Help me!”
Chen Ping roared in his sea of consciousness.
“Hahaha… you finally decided to beg this old man, huh?”
“It’s been ages since I last possessed you and had some fun!”
From the depths of his sea of consciousness, the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord spoke with a hint of mockery, “Let’s see how much of my power your body can handle!”
As his voice fell, Chen Ping’s sea of consciousness erupted with a world-destroying aura, a pitch-black energy, like a volcanic eruption, surging from his body, instantly enveloping him entirely.
“This… what is this aura?”
The old Taoist Xuanzhi’s face changed drastically, his eyes revealing shock for the first time, “More terrifying than a ninth-grade Loose Immortal! This kid… he’s hiding such a horrifying existence within him?”
