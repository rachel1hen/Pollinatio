“What’s that?” Hu Mazi, upon hearing this, immediately became agitated, “What did you say? Does this mean my clansmen’s divine souls are still intact?”
You Wuji nodded, “They should be. The cultivation techniques of the Evil Path Hall are rather peculiar, capable of refining others’ divine souls for their own use.”
“He took so many divine souls from the Hu clan, it’s unlikely he could refine them all at once. Some might still be imprisoned.”
Tears of excitement welled up in Hu Mazi’s eyes, “That’s wonderful… wonderful… As long as their divine souls remain, my clansmen still have a chance for revival!”
Chen Ping also breathed a sigh of relief, patting Hu Mazi’s shoulder, “Master Hu, rest assured, we will definitely rescue your clansmen’s divine souls and let them find peace.”
“I can help too. I can find a chance to ask my brother and probe into the whereabouts of the Hu clan’s divine souls.”
“You know, the Evil Path Hall has branches everywhere, collecting spirits and divine souls. Without someone to gather information, it would be very difficult for you to find them.”
You Wuji hurriedly added!
He said this purely to save his own skin, knowing that only by being useful could he preserve his life!
Chen Ping glanced at the dejected You Wuji and said coldly, “I’ll spare your wretched life for now, but if you dare to play tricks, I guarantee your soul will be utterly destroyed, never to find peace.”
You Wuji quickly kowtowed like a pestle, “I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare! Rest assured, Mr. Chen, I will do my utmost to gather information, without the slightest deceit!”
He had long been terrified by Nan Batian, and now, preserving his life was already a stroke of fortune. He dared not entertain other thoughts, letting out a long sigh as cold sweat soaked his back.
Hu Mazi, listening nearby, gritted his teeth in anger, the deep blood feud of his clansmen surging in his heart. His gaze fell on the trembling Youyue Witch, a flash of ruthlessness in his eyes.
He strode towards Youyue, who turned pale with fright, shrinking back behind You Wuji.
“Father, save me!” Youyue cried out, her voice filled with fear.
You Wuji’s eyelids twitched wildly, but he kept his head down, not daring to meet Hu Mazi’s gaze.
His own life was in others’ hands, so how could he care about his daughter’s fate? He could only pretend not to hear, his fingernails digging deep into his palms to mask his inner humiliation.
Hu Mazi yanked Youyue from behind You Wuji, dragging her like a dead dog into the side hall nearby.
Youyue’s cries soon turned to stifled sobs, followed by moans of pleasure.
Outside the side hall, You Wuji’s body trembled slightly, yet he never dared utter a word.
Chen Ping watched coldly, not intervening. Some debts had to be repaid.
He was, however, quite impressed with Hu Mazi’s prowess in bed!
Half an hour later, Hu Mazi emerged from the side hall, a satisfied expression on his face. Youyue followed behind, her gaze towards Hu Mazi devoid of anger or hatred, instead carrying a hint of contentment.
It was clear she had enjoyed it, savouring the experience.
“Chen Ping, let’s go,” Hu Mazi said.
Chen Ping nodded, turning to You Wuji, “You have three days. I want to know the exact whereabouts of the Hu clan’s divine souls. I’ll come for you in three days.”
“Yes, yes!” You Wuji hurriedly agreed.
The three left the Black Fiend Demon Palace. Nan Batian said gravely, “Most of the forces in Jiupan Mountain are colluding with the Black Fiend Demon Palace. Some even participated in the Hu clan’s destruction back then. Why not take this chance to wipe them all out?”
A cold glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes, “I was thinking the same! Since we’re making a move, let’s root them out completely to avoid future trouble.”
Hu Mazi was even more eager, rubbing his hands, “It’s long overdue!”
The three immediately began dealing with the forces of Jiupan Mountain. With Nan Batian present, smaller forces were eradicated with a wave of his hand.
In less than a day, most of the dozens of forces, large and small, in Jiupan Mountain were wiped out, blood flowing like rivers, cries echoing everywhere.
Those forces that once thrived under the Black Fiend Demon Palace’s protection had no chance to beg for mercy before being utterly annihilated.
