Chen Ping stared at the cold glint of the sword in the stone figure’s hand, his heart filled with reluctance and doubt.
In that earth-shaking battle just now, he, who was reputedly invincible in the Third Heaven, had been utterly overwhelmed by a lifeless stone figure, an undeniable humiliation.
Yet, when the stone figure suddenly halted, he vaguely sensed it might be a turning point.
Yun Wuya looked at Chen Ping with concern, “Mr. Chen, shall we retreat for now and make a plan?”
Chen Ping wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, his gaze fixed on the stone figure, “No need, this stone figure is strange, but I feel it holds some secret.”
With that, he stuffed the last pill into his mouth, feeling the medicinal power surge through his body, restoring his depleted strength.
After a moment, Chen Ping took a deep breath, gripped the Dragon-Slaying Sword tightly, and charged at the stone figure again.
This time, he didn’t rush to attack but focused on defence, carefully observing the stone figure’s swordplay.
The sword in the stone figure’s hand remained sharp, each move and form carrying an indescribable rhythm, as if imbued with the principles of heaven and earth.
As time passed, Chen Ping gradually noticed that the stone figure’s swordplay, seemingly erratic, actually followed a certain pattern.
Each swing of its sword seemed to embody a unique sword intent.
A flash of realisation struck him, could this stone figure be a test for those who entered this place? Or perhaps, was it guiding them to comprehend a higher level of sword intent?
At this thought, Chen Ping’s fighting spirit burned even brighter.
He no longer saw the stone figure as an enemy but as a rare “teacher.”
He began trying to mimic the stone figure’s swordplay, feeling its nuances.
At first, his movements were clumsy, often flustered by the stone figure’s sword, but with persistent attempts, he gradually found a rhythm.
During one defensive move, Chen Ping instinctively swung his sword following the stone figure’s pattern.
This strike unexpectedly deflected the stone figure’s attack, even showing faint signs of a counterattack.
This discovery thrilled Chen Ping, he knew he was on the right path.
From then on, he threw himself into “sparring” with the stone figure, refining his swordplay with each clash, comprehending its sword intent.
As time went on, Chen Ping’s swordplay grew more refined.
His sword began to carry a unique charm, no longer just a blend of strength and technique but enriched with an understanding and insight into sword intent.
His eight clones reappeared, this time their swordplay more unpredictable, resonating with the stone figure’s techniques.
In the battle, Chen Ping noticed the stone figure’s swordplay had many variations.
At times, it was like a raging storm, ferocious and overwhelming, at others, like a gentle stream, silent and nurturing.
Each variation brought Chen Ping new insights, he began incorporating these changes into his Nine Shadows Sword Technique, making it more complete.
Once, the stone figure suddenly unleashed a new sword technique, its sword shadows filling the sky, as if sealing the entire space.
Chen Ping struggled to hold his ground in this sea of sword shadows, just as he thought he was about to lose, a spark of inspiration flashed in his mind.
He recalled the sword intent he had comprehended during his battles with the stone figure, fusing them together to unleash a never-before-seen sword technique.
This move, like a dazzling beam of light, broke through the stone figure’s sword shadow blockade, striking directly at it.
The stone figure seemed to sense the power of this move and immediately swung its sword to block.
The two powerful forces collided, producing an energy wave stronger than any before.
Yet, this time, Chen Ping wasn’t sent flying.
