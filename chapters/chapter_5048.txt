“If there’s danger, we’ll face it together. Even if we die, we’ll have company on the road to the underworld.”
Mo Qingyun gave a faint smile.
Chen Ping laughed as well, “With me here, you won’t die…”
Chen Ping’s heart was calm; he knew he wouldn’t die.
Because if he died, there would be no story to follow.
“You don’t like that effeminate guy?” Chen Ping asked.
“Do I need to say it? He makes me sick,” Mo Qingyun nodded.
Then, with a helpless expression, she said, “But Tianyuan Pavilion is powerful. To build ties with them, I have to marry him.”
“Have you never thought of resisting?” Chen Ping asked.
“I don’t have the strength,” Mo Qingyun shook her head.
“Find an opportunity, and I’ll kill that effeminate guy, then you’ll be free.”
Chen Ping said as he walked with Mo Qingyun.
“You’re no match for him!” Mo Qingyun replied.
“Maybe not now, but I have help. Killing him would be a piece of cake.”
Chen Ping smiled faintly, then asked the Scarlet Cloud Demon Lord, “Senior, if you were to kill that effeminate guy, would it be a problem for me?”
“With your body’s resilience, let alone that guy, I could make everyone here meet their end,” the Scarlet Cloud Demon Lord said.
“Good to know!” Chen Ping grinned.
“Who are you talking to?” Mo Qingyun looked confused.
“An old friend…”
Chen Ping smiled.
The two chatted as they walked, soon reaching the dilapidated stone platform.
At this point, Chen Ping drew his Dragon-Slaying Sword, fully on guard, especially wary of the two warrior statues, which he felt could attack at any moment.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand was trembling slightly, likely sensing the presence of danger.
In the distance, Tianci coldly watched Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun, their cheerful conversation falling into his view. He wished he could kill Chen Ping on the spot.
But despite his anger, Tianci remained vigilant. If anything seemed off, they would flee immediately.
Though relics held treasures, they also came with dangers.
This was why, despite knowing about relics, few dared to explore them—one misstep could mean death.
What use were treasures if you were dead?
This relic, in particular, was especially eerie, making everyone cautious. At the slightest disturbance, they would run without hesitation.
Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun stood before the stone platform, the eyes of the two warrior statues staring directly at them.
This sent a chill through Chen Ping, stirring some fear in his heart.
“Let’s go…”
Mo Qingyun pulled Chen Ping, and they slowly approached the platform, their steps deliberate.
But when they reached the three coffins, Chen Ping was shocked to notice that the eyes of the two warrior statues had somehow shifted, still fixed on them.
Chen Ping shook his head, thinking he might have seen wrong, but upon closer inspection, the statues’ eyes had indeed moved.
This made Chen Ping’s heart race, his hand gripping the Dragon-Slaying Sword trembling slightly.
“Miss Mo, don’t you think there’s something off about these two warrior statues?”
Chen Ping asked Mo Qingyun.
“No,” Mo Qingyun shook her head.
Her attention was entirely on the three coffins, and she hadn’t noticed the warrior statues.
Seeing this, Chen Ping didn’t say more. Since Mo Qingyun hadn’t noticed, he wouldn’t tell her, to avoid frightening her.
Chen Ping steadied his mind, took a deep breath, and then turned his attention to the three coffins.
Upon closer inspection, the three blood-red coffins seemed to have blood flowing across their surfaces.
