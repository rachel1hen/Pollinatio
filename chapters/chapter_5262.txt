Is this still the ferocious, fearsome fat lady who dared to beat even the city lord’s son?
This tone, this look in her eyes, it’s practically like a lovesick maiden seeing her beloved!
Nan Batian’s brows furrowed tightly, clearly troubled by the fat lady’s behaviour. He said in a deep voice, “I’ve come to take my friend away.”
“Friend?”
The fat lady’s gaze fell on Chen Ping, who stood behind Nan Batian, then shifted back to Nan Batian’s face, the joy in her eyes growing even stronger.
She took a step forward, actually reaching out with her plump arm, trying to wrap it around Nan Batian’s neck. “Batian, you’ve finally come to see me! I thought you’d never want to see me again in this lifetime!”
Nan Batian’s body stiffened, instinctively wanting to dodge, but seeing the anticipation mixed with a trace of vulnerability in the fat lady’s eyes, he ultimately didn’t move, though his expression grew even grimmer.
“Muah!”
Taking advantage of Nan Batian’s hesitation, the fat lady stood on tiptoe and planted a firm kiss on his cheek, leaving a greasy lip mark.
“Oh my!”
The surrounding cultivators let out a collective gasp; the scene was just too shocking.
Nan Batian’s face flushed red with a mix of shame and anger, yet he couldn’t lash out. He could only muster, “Fat lady, have some self-respect!”
“I won’t have self-respect, I want it like this!”
But the fat lady, acting like a petulant little girl, didn’t hold back. If anything, she grew even more excited, staring intently at Nan Batian. “Batian, I’ve liked you for so long, why won’t you accept me? Do you know how much I’ve suffered all these years you’ve been avoiding me?”
So that’s how it is!
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi suddenly understood.
No wonder Nan Batian refused to enter the city; it was because of this fat lady, the building master, who was utterly devoted to him and whom he couldn’t bear to face!
What an incredible coincidence, and so dramatic!
Nan Batian’s face alternated between pale and flushed. He took a deep breath, trying to keep his tone calm. “Fat lady, we’ll talk about our matters later. Chen Ping is my saviour. Today, you must give me face and let him go.”
“Saviour?”
The fat lady paused, then looked at Chen Ping with curiosity. “He’s your saviour?”
Nan Batian nodded solemnly. “That’s right. If it weren’t for him, I’d still be trapped in the Skyward Ladder. If you want to touch him, you’ll have to step over my dead body.”
Seeing the resolve in Nan Batian’s eyes, the fat lady knew he wasn’t joking.
Her eyes flickered, and her expression changed again. The murderous intent she’d previously directed at Chen Ping vanished completely, replaced by a hint of warmth and… flattery?
She first glared at the stunned remaining guards of the information building. “What are you standing there for? Hurry up and fetch the best healing pills for this young brother!”
The guards, bewildered by the fat lady’s sudden shift, didn’t dare disobey and scrambled off to find the pills.
Then, the fat lady quickly stepped up to Chen Ping, her face breaking into a smile. Though her appearance made the smile somewhat menacing, it was genuinely kind. “Oh, young brother, I’m so sorry! I was reckless earlier, not knowing you were Batian’s saviour. I’ve offended you, please don’t take it to heart!”
This change in attitude was a complete one-eighty, leaving the nearby Sword Sect disciples and onlookers dumbfounded.
Chen Ping was equally stunned; the plot was unfolding too quickly for him to keep up.
Nan Batian let out a sigh of relief, seeing a chance for things to turn around.
“Are you alright? Are your injuries serious?”
The fat lady looked at Chen Ping’s wounds with concern, her tone as caring as if she were speaking to her own younger brother.
