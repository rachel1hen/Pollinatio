“This is all you’ve got, and you dare to make a fuss?”
Chen Ping sneered, “If this is the best the Mo family can offer, you might as well shut your doors for good.”
“Scoundrel!”
Mo Qingchen could no longer hold back and took action himself!
A fifth-grade Loose Immortal, he was considered a genius among the younger generation!
“You’re courting death!”
Mo Qingchen roared, three beams of white light shooting from his sleeve, transforming into sharp blades aimed straight at Chen Ping’s face.
A third-grade Loose Immortal was nothing but an ant before a fifth-grade like him, this strike would leave Chen Ping crippled on the spot!
Yet before the cold light could reach, Chen Ping flicked his fingers, a golden sword aura slicing through the air, instantly shattering the white beams into fragments.
Mo Qingchen’s pupils contracted, but before he could react, Chen Ping closed the distance, his index and middle fingers pressed together like a blade, poised at Mo Qingchen’s throat, “I’ll give you three breaths to apologise to Qingyun.”
“You… you dare touch me?”
Mo Qingchen’s voice trembled, but he still tried to hold his ground, “I’m a direct descendant of the Mo family, if you harm me, the entire Mo family won’t let you off!”
“Oh?”
Chen Ping raised an eyebrow, applying slight pressure with his fingers. Mo Qingchen instantly felt his throat constrict, his breathing laboured.
His face flushed red, he looked around in panic, only to see the Mo family elders either wary or turning away, not one daring to step forward to help.
“Three…” Chen Ping began counting.
“Two…”
“I, I apologise!”
Mo Qingchen couldn’t hold out any longer, shrieking, “Qingyun, I’m sorry! I shouldn’t have insulted you… please, make him stop!”
Chen Ping released his grip, and Mo Qingchen stumbled back, clutching his throat, coughing uncontrollably, his eyes brimming with resentment.
The hall fell deathly silent!
No one expected Mo Qingchen, a fifth-grade Loose Immortal, to be utterly powerless against Chen Ping, a mere third-grade Loose Immortal!
Mo Wuji looked at Chen Ping with a complex gaze, “Young friend, your strength is remarkable. May I ask who your master is?”
If Chen Ping had a powerful sect or master behind him, the Mo family could latch onto him and no longer need to bow to Tianyuan Pavilion!
Chen Ping said calmly, “No sect, no master, just a lone cultivator.”
Mo Wuji’s heart skipped a beat. A lone cultivator with such strength? This lad was no ordinary man!
“Uncle!”
Mo Qingchen glared coldly at Chen Ping, “He dared to act in our Mo family, we can’t let him off lightly! And Qingyun with him…”
“Enough!”
Mo Wuji snapped, “Haven’t you embarrassed us enough?”
“I’m still the patriarch, it’s not your place to tell me what to do!”
Then Mo Wuji turned to Chen Ping, his tone softening, “Young friend, this was due to our Mo family’s poor discipline, please forgive us.”
Chen Ping waved a hand with a smile, “No matter, I just can’t stand certain people who lack ability yet blame a woman for their failures.”
Mo Qingchen’s face darkened, his fists clenched so tightly they cracked, but he didn’t dare speak again.
“Since you’re Qingyun’s friend, it’s late, so stay here. Qingyun will arrange things for you!”
Mo Wuji said.
“Thank you, Patriarch Mo!” Chen Ping bowed in thanks.
Chen Ping followed Mo Qingyun out, while Mo Qingchen, watching them leave, had eyes full of venom.
Mo Qingchen turned and slipped into a secret chamber, crushing a messaging jade talisman.
Moments later, a shadowy figure appeared, none other than Elder Tong of Tianyuan Pavilion!
“Young Master Mo, how’s it going?”
Elder Tong asked with a sinister smile.
Mo Qingchen gritted his teeth, “Mo Qingyun’s back, but she brought a bloke named Chen Ping, and his strength is a bit freakish.”
“I know, don’t underestimate that Chen Ping,” Elder Tong said.
“Elder Tong, this guy’s sudden appearance, will it affect my chances of becoming the Mo family patriarch?” Mo Qingchen asked urgently.
“It shouldn’t. Chen Ping won’t stay in the Mo family forever.”
“Besides, tomorrow I’ll accompany Young Master Tianci to visit in person, you just need to…”
The conspiring voices gradually faded.
