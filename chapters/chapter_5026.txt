“Chen Ping, I believe in you, you can do it!” Hu Mazi cheered for Chen Ping.
The cultivators of Cangxuan Continent all looked at Chen Ping in disbelief!
In their eyes, a first-rank Loose Immortal fighting a fifth-rank was simply impossible, calling it throwing an egg at a rock was being polite.
Although Chen Ping had just shown great strength, the gap in their realms was too vast.
“Fine, I’ll compete with you. It seems I need to show you something, or you won’t know how many eyes Lord Ma has!”
Huo Zhao stepped forward, and a terrifying pressure swept over!
Chen Ping sneered, lightly waving his hand, easily dispelling the terrifying pressure!
He told Mo Qingyun to keep an eye on Huo Jingjing and not let her escape.
The reason he didn’t dare let Hu Mazi guard Huo Jingjing was that Chen Ping feared Hu Mazi might lose control and, in front of tens of thousands, put on a live show, which would cause trouble.
Given Huo Jingjing’s temperament, she might self-destruct on the spot.
Holding the Dragon-Slaying Sword, Chen Ping leaped into the air, facing Huo Zhao from a distance.
“Make your move…” Chen Ping beckoned to Huo Zhao!
“Wait!” Huo Zhao raised his hand, “Chen Ping, for a fair duel, you can’t let anyone possess you, otherwise, it wouldn’t be your own strength.”
“No problem!” Chen Ping nodded!
He knew Huo Zhao was scared from being beaten by the Red Cloud Demon Lord, but even without the Demon Lord’s possession, Chen Ping was confident he could defeat Huo Zhao!
Chen Ping had many divine weapons, a Fire Qilin, and the mysterious Little Devouring Beast, so he knew he wouldn’t lose.
“Come on…” Huo Zhao said, launching an attack on Chen Ping!
“Boom!”
A deafening thunderclap exploded between heaven and earth. Huo Zhao’s figure left a trail of afterimages in the void, instantly appearing a hundred zhang above Chen Ping.
His hands formed seals, spiritual energy surging around him like boiling magma, shattering the clouds within a hundred li.
“Heavenly Gang Divine Palm!”
With a loud shout, Huo Zhao slammed his right palm downward.
Instantly, a golden giant palm, covering the sky, formed out of thin air, its palm lines clearly visible, each groove containing destructive power.
Before the palm even landed, the ground below began to collapse, countless stones crushed into dust by the terrifying pressure.
“Friend Chen, be careful!”
Mo Qingyun cried out, her fists clenched tightly, nails digging into her palms.
She could clearly feel the power in this palm, even she, at the peak of the third-rank Loose Immortal Realm, could never withstand it.
“It’s over, it’s over…”
The cultivators of Cangxuan Continent turned ashen, many collapsing to the ground.
A white-haired elder trembled, “The power of this palm could probably level a thousand li…”
Just when everyone thought Chen Ping was doomed, his tall figure suddenly moved.
“Break!”
Chen Ping let out a clear shout, the Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand bursting with blinding blood-red light.
The sword trembled, emitting a dragon-like hum.
Holding the sword with both hands, he swung upward against the descending giant palm.
A blood-red sword beam shot into the sky, tracing a perfect arc, like a blood moon rising.
“Boom!”
A deafening explosion echoed through the clouds.
The blood-red sword beam collided with the golden giant palm in midair, erupting in blinding light.
A violent spiritual energy shockwave spread in a ring, snapping buildings within several li in half.
As the dust settled, everyone’s eyes widened—the seemingly invincible giant palm had been split in two!
“What?!”
Huo Zhao’s pupils shrank, his face twitching unnaturally.
He stared at Chen Ping, his voice filled with disbelief, “You, a mere first-rank Loose Immortal, how could you break my palm?!”
