The Zhang responsible from Sword Saint City was also prominently present. He stood beside Qin Lie, with a barely noticeable smugness on his face.
“Chen Ping! Get out here!”
Qin Lie roared, his voice exploding like thunder. “If anything happens to my son, I will ensure that your Sword Sect, from top to bottom, leaves no survivors!”
Chen Ping slowly walked out of the gate, followed by Mo Chen, Hu Mazi, Ling Xue, and all the Sword Sect disciples.
Although their numbers were far inferior to the opponent’s, each person’s face carried a resolute determination to face death.
“Where is Qin Feng?”
Qin Lie stared fixedly at Chen Ping, the killing intent in his eyes almost solidifying into substance.
“His cultivation has been abolished, and he was thrown outside the city.”
Chen Ping’s tone was flat, as if speaking of an insignificant matter.
“You’re courting death!”
Qin Lie trembled with rage, his Earth Immortal Realm eighth-stage pressure erupting like a tsunami. “My son’s arms were severed, his cultivation completely abolished, and you still dare to be so arrogant!”
“He brought it upon himself.”
Chen Ping fearlessly met his gaze. “If not for my master’s intervention, he would already be a corpse.”
“Moreover, remember this: this is Sword Saint City, Li Chunfeng’s territory, not your Divine Sword Manor!”
Chen Ping knew that Li Chunfeng was behind him, so he was not afraid of this Qin Lie. Even if Qin Lie had gathered so many sects, Chen Ping was not afraid.
Upon mentioning Li Chunfeng, Qin Lie’s expression changed slightly, but it was immediately replaced by anger. “Don’t think that bringing up City Lord Li can scare me! For today’s matter, even if the city lord comes, he can’t protect you!”
He turned sideways to look at the Zhang responsible. “Brother Zhang, this Chen Ping has used force to injure people within Sword Saint City, treating human lives like grass. Shouldn’t he be dealt with according to the rules?”
The Zhang responsible cleared his throat and stepped forward. “Chen Ping, you have repeatedly caused conflicts within Sword Saint City, severely injuring the young master of Divine Sword Manor, which has violated the city regulations.”
“Considering it’s your first offence, if you are willing to abolish your own cultivation and hand over the Sword Sect’s residence, this old man might still plead for you and spare your life.”
These words seemed fair, but the bias was overflowing in his speech.
Chen Ping looked at the Zhang responsible in confusion, not expecting this person to change so quickly!
During the competition, the Zhang responsible had used his own status to strongly suppress Qin Lie from using force.
But now, he had actually sided with Qin Lie!
Needless to say, this guy must have received benefits from Qin Lie, and those benefits were something he could not refuse.
“Hahaha!”
Hu Mazi could not help but laugh. “Surname Zhang, you’re probably received benefits from the Qin family, right? Qin Feng brought people to provoke at the door, using aphrodisiacs to frame Miss Ling Xue. How did it become Chen Ping’s fault in your mouth?”
The Zhang responsible’s face darkened. “Don’t talk nonsense! This old man has always acted justly!”
“Justly?”
Chen Ping sneered. “I think Divine Sword Manor gave you treasures, right?”
His gaze swept over the Zhang responsible, as if trying to see through him.
The Zhang responsible’s expression changed slightly, appearing somewhat embarrassed. He had indeed received a treasured sword from Divine Sword Manor, and it was even the manor’s town-guarding treasure.
Otherwise, as the responsible of Sword Saint City, he would not so openly side with Qin Lie.
And these sect responsibles had also received benefits from Divine Sword Manor, so they followed Qin Lie to crusade against Chen Ping and the Sword Sect.
After all, in this society where the weak are prey to the strong, no one rises early without profit.
They had no relation to Chen Ping, so since Divine Sword Manor was willing to offer benefits, they were all very happy to accept!
“Nonsense!” The Zhang responsible shouted sternly but weakly. “Capture this arrogant fellow for me!”
With his command, the surrounding cultivators immediately surrounded them, various magical treasures flashing with spiritual light, murderous intent soaring.
Mo Chen protected Chen Ping behind him, drawing his long sword. “If you want to touch my disciple, step over my corpse first!”
