The Sky-Devouring Beast opened its mouth, gently inhaling, and the Nether Lamp, Blood-Red Ribbon, Mysterious Flower Axe, and Ice Wind Finger instantly vanished into its maw, along with the four grey-robed elders who were pulled in by an immense force.
“Save me!”
The red-robed woman’s ribbon clung desperately to the ground, but the Sky-Devouring Beast swatted it with a claw, and she, along with her ribbon, was swept into its mouth.
The bare-chested brute swung his axe at the giant claw, but the axe sank like a stone in the sea, and the next second, he was swallowed without a trace.
The Taotie phantom, sensing the aura of its natural enemy, let out a terrified roar, attempting to flee into the void, but the Sky-Devouring Beast bit down on its neck.
The body of black mist was chewed thoroughly in the beast’s jaws, and the hundreds of eyeballs emitting dark green beams couldn’t even scratch its scales.
The Fire Qilin returned to Chen Ping’s side, looking somewhat dejected and embarrassed.
It spent its days with the Sky-Devouring Beast, stored in Chen Ping’s storage ring!
But in critical moments, it relied on the Sky-Devouring Beast, utterly unable to assist Chen Ping!
Chen Ping gently stroked the Fire Qilin’s head, comforting it, “You’re pretty great too, no need to feel bad.”
With that, Chen Ping sent the Fire Qilin to heal, as the storage ring held plenty of resources to help it grow!
When Chen Ping turned to the Sky-Devouring Beast, he saw it casually devouring the five Ghost Faces and the Taotie phantom like snacks, leaving not a wisp of their aura behind.
“This…”
Yun Wuya, leaning on his broken green flag, looked incredulous, “Ninth-grade Loose Immortal… just gone like that?”
Hu Mazi poked his head out from behind the stone gate, equally stunned, “Blimey, this beast is too bloody powerful, innit?”
“Master Hu, watch your language, it can understand you, careful it doesn’t eat you!” Chen Ping teased!
Hu Mazi quickly ducked back in fright.
The Sky-Devouring Beast let out a satisfied burp, transformed into a ball of golden light, and returned to Chen Ping’s storage ring!
The world fell silent, save for the crackling embers in the ruins of the Blood Shadow Palace and the distant clamour of disciples hauling resources.
Chen Ping was a bit exasperated; the Sky-Devouring Beast was formidable, but it didn’t communicate with him, if only it could obey!
“Senior, your mount is way beyond powerful!” Chen Ping said!
“Rubbish, I’m down to a wisp of soul, wait till I restore my body, those five little pests, one glare from me would turn them to ash!”
The Red Cloud Demon Lord said, dissatisfied!
“Mr. Chen.”
Yun Wuya approached Chen Ping, his voice tinged with awe, “Was that… was that the Sky-Devouring Beast?”
“Yes!” Chen Ping nodded!
Yun Wuya stared at Chen Ping in disbelief, overwhelmed by the increasing shocks Chen Ping brought!
Fighting above his level, summoning a golden dragon, and now a Fire Qilin and Sky-Devouring Beast?
Yun Wuya couldn’t fathom what kind of force backed Chen Ping!
But one thing was clear, Chen Ping’s backing wasn’t from the Third Heaven, it had to be from a much higher celestial realm!
The secret vault’s resources had been cleared out, and the disciples, with bulging storage bags, looked at Chen Ping with admiration.
Yun Wuya directed the group to organise the team, while Hu Mazi rummaged through the ruins, checking for overlooked treasures.
“Mr. Chen,” a Qingyun Sect disciple approached, holding a blood-stained token, “This fell from Ghost Face, it has the character ‘Underworld’ on it.”
Chen Ping took the token, cold to the touch, with the carved ‘Underworld’ character faintly exuding black mist.
“This might be the token of that mysterious organisation, could it grant access to their stronghold?”
Yun Wuya asked!
“Possibly!” Chen Ping pocketed the token.
“Chen Ping, where to next?” Hu Mazi asked!
Chen Ping gazed into the distance, one more Seven Halls to deal with!
Once the Seven Halls were handled, Chen Ping could focus fully on investigating this mysterious organisation!
