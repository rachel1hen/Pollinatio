Chen Ping even mentioned the birthmark in Bai Qian’s private area, which finally convinced the old man, as only someone who had been intimate with Bai Qian would know such details.
“So, you really are my son-in-law, get up, get up…”
The old man acknowledged Chen Ping’s identity.
Sizing Chen Ping up, the old man grew fonder by the moment, then patted his shoulder and said, “Not bad, though your realm is low, your strength is impressive, and you’re easy on the eyes. Have you two thought about having children?”
“Not yet, we plan to wait until Bai Qian arrives in the Heavenly Realm and we both have immortal bones. That way, our child will be born with an immortal bone, giving them a head start.”
“By then, you’ll be here too, helping look after your grandchild, enjoying family bliss…”
Chen Ping flattered the old man thoroughly.
“Hahaha, I’ll prepare plenty of gifts for my grandchild then.”
The old man was delighted, then asked, “What’s Bai Qian’s strength now? Is she close to coming to the Heavenly Realm?”
He seemed eager for Chen Ping and Bai Qian to have a child soon.
“Soon, probably at the next Great Dao summoning,” Chen Ping said.
“That’s wonderful…” The old man was thrilled.
Seeing the old man’s excitement, Chen Ping felt a pang of guilt for deceiving him, but it was a white lie, so it shouldn’t count as deceit.
His relationship with Bai Qian, after all, was genuine!
“Father-in-law, how did you figure out we’re human?”
Chen Ping asked, deeply curious.
“I noticed it at the arena. The bloodline aura on you was far too familiar to me.”
“As for the person with you, though they had a concealment talisman, our fox demon clan is highly sensitive to auras, so I picked it up.”
The old man explained to Chen Ping.
“Father-in-law, you’ve been in Rhino City for centuries. How does one obtain cultivation resources here?”
“The resources I brought from the Celestial Realm are nearly depleted, and relying solely on the immortal qi of the Heavenly Realm for cultivation is too slow.”
Chen Ping wanted to know how to acquire resources. With resources and the time-warping ability of the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda, he believed he could quickly break through the Immortal Transformation Realm.
“Besides the immortal qi, resources in the First Heaven of the Heavenly Realm are scarce, which is why the three clans are divided and often at war.”
“It’s all about fighting for resources, not just between the three clans, but even within the same clan, cities annex each other for resources.”
“But if you want resources for cultivation, try to become a guest elder in the City Lord’s Mansion, where you can get a fair amount.”
“The mansion periodically takes people out of the city to plunder resources from the Hell Jungle.”
“Alternatively, you could fight in the black market. In beast clan cities, everyone is competitive and loves fighting. The matches you had on that platform were official, legitimate arena fights.”
“In Rhino City, there’s also a black market arena, where physical strength and endurance are tested too, but you can place bets. Winning earns you immortal coins, which you can use to buy various resources.”
The old man explained in detail, naturally wanting to guide his son-in-law thoroughly!
Hearing this, Chen Ping felt that becoming a guest elder in the City Lord’s Mansion wasn’t realistic yet, given his current strength, but the black market fights were worth a try.
“Father-in-law, it’s getting late. Why don’t you stay here, and tomorrow you can take me to the black market to have a look?”
Chen Ping suggested.
“Alright, with your skills and physical prowess, winning a few matches should be no problem!”
The old man nodded.
Chen Ping brought the old man into the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda, where the accelerated time flow meant one night of cultivation equaled ten nights outside.
Seeing the pagoda and hearing Chen Ping describe its abilities, the old man was astonished!
“My son-in-law is truly capable…”
The old man grew even fonder of Chen Ping!
