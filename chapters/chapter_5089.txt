The stone tiles beneath his feet shattered inch by inch, his figure transforming into a streak of black light, charging straight at Chen Ping’s face.
The Soul-Devouring Blade traced a crescent moon-like arc, the blade’s wind slicing through the air, causing the lanterns on either side of the bridge to burst with a “puff” sound, sparks scattering onto the lake, even forcing the ripples to roll backward.
“Well met!” Chen Ping didn’t retreat, instead advancing, his blade glowing brilliantly with golden light.
Unlike when he fought the demon, he didn’t summon the golden sword’s spirit but flicked his fingers, unleashing a cascade of sword qi from the blade, like a river of stars crashing toward the dark blade.
“Clang!”
The deafening clash of metal rang out, and in the moment their immense forces collided, the stone railings of the Nine-Bend Bridge exploded.
Countless fragments were swept into the air by the energy wave, only to be ground to dust as they fell.
The Great Elder grunted, forced back three steps, blood seeping from his palm, dripping onto the Soul-Devouring Blade, making its bloodlight glow even brighter.
A flicker of shock passed through his eyes: “Third-grade Loose Immortal… you can block thirty percent of my strength?”
He was a seventh-grade Loose Immortal, now forcibly boosting his power by burning his lifespan, ordinary Loose Immortals couldn’t last three moves against him.
Chen Ping didn’t respond, his figure drifting up like a willow seed, the blade turning into a streak of golden light, stabbing at the Great Elder’s waist from a cunning angle.
The strike was lightning-fast, its sharp intent tearing several gashes in the Great Elder’s robe before the blade even arrived.
The Great Elder’s pupils contracted, the Soul-Devouring Blade swinging back to defend, its edge clashing with the sword qi, sparking a storm of chaotic energy.
The lake water surged into waves several metres high, koi fish leaping frantically in the turmoil, only to be stunned belly-up by the invisible force.
The two traded blows on the bridge, their moves growing ever more vicious.
The Great Elder’s blade work was ferocious, like a Shura descending, each strike carrying the might to tear space, the air crackling with a “sizzling” sound;
Chen Ping’s swordplay flowed like clouds and water, the blade in his hand sometimes roaring as a golden dragon, sometimes piercing like a fine needle, always dodging lethal strikes at the last moment while countering with sharp sword intent.
“Boom!”
The Great Elder leapt high, slashing downward with the Soul-Devouring Blade, unleashing a black blade aura dozens of metres long, cleaving toward the bridge.
Chen Ping’s eyes narrowed, raising his sword before him, golden light surging into a radiant shield.
The blade aura struck the shield, erupting in a deafening roar, splitting the bridge in two, Chen Ping and the Great Elder standing on opposite ends of the broken span, their robes tattered by the energy.
“Old fool, is brute force all you’ve got?”
Chen Ping wiped a trickle of blood from his mouth, having blocked the strike but suffering internal injuries.
The Great Elder’s strength exceeded expectations, no one could have predicted he’d burn his lifespan before even fighting.
Likely, seeing Chen Ping effortlessly slay Sang Qi, the Great Elder lacked confidence, resorting to such measures.
Chen Ping knew if he didn’t get serious, escape would be difficult.
The Great Elder roared, his murderous aura thickening like ink, gripping the Soul-Devouring Blade with both hands, its tip aimed at Chen Ping, the bloodlight on the blade coalescing into a ghastly Shura head phantom.
“Shura’s End!”
With his bellow, the Shura phantom opened its maw, spewing a pitch-black beam, rippling space itself as if it would be devoured by this force.
“Interesting.”
A trace of gravity flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes, recognising this as the Great Elder’s ultimate move.
His blade spun rapidly in his hand, the gem at its hilt flaring, the blade erupting in unprecedented golden brilliance, a true golden dragon phantom soaring from the sword, its eyes blazing, roaring as it met the black beam.
“Roar!”
The golden dragon’s bellow shook the heavens;
“Howl!”
The Shura’s shriek chilled gods and ghosts.
