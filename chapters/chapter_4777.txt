If it weren’t for the Tenth Hall Master secretly releasing Yun Li, Yun Li might have been imprisoned for life!
Yun Li’s decision to follow Chen Ping was a case of heroes recognizing each other’s worth.
“I just hope to break through to the peak of the Great Ascension Realm and reach the Transformation Realm…”
Zhou Tang was eager to advance to the Transformation Realm.
“That’s simple. Mr. Chen has given us so many resources. Let’s take advantage of this downtime and make the breakthrough!”
Xuan Bin said.
“Right, we can’t afford to idle around. We need to break through as soon as possible. Given Mr. Chen’s talent, it won’t be long before our current strength becomes insufficient to assist him.”
Cang Yue added.
The three of them asked Emperor Xiao Yuan Shan to find them a quiet place to focus on their breakthrough. Once they reached the peak of the Great Ascension Realm, their strength would reach a new level.
Watching Xuan Bin and the others leave, Emperor Xiao sighed softly, “Ah, when will I reach the peak of the Great Ascension Realm…”
As the saying goes, one mountain looks higher than the next, and human desires are endless.
Xuan Bin and the others were also troubled by their desire to break through to the Transformation Realm. They envied Transformation Realm cultivators immensely.
What they didn’t realize was that other cultivators looked at them with the same envy.
For Emperor Xiao to reach the peak of the Great Ascension Realm, he still had a long way to go.

In the secluded room, Chen Ping and Hua Yueying stood facing each other.
“Miss Hua, if you’re unwilling to teach me, I won’t force you. I’ll still share resources with you in the future. You don’t need to feel pressured.”
Chen Ping didn’t want to coerce Hua Yueying.
After all, it was her family’s secret technique. Whether she wanted to teach it or not was entirely her decision.
“I can teach you, but on one condition…”
Hua Yueying said.
“What condition?” Chen Ping was taken aback.
“Sleep with me…”
Hua Yueying stated.
“What?” Chen Ping was stunned, not immediately processing her words.
“Sleep with me…” Hua Yueying repeated.
“This… is this appropriate? We’ve only just met!” Chen Ping said awkwardly.
“It’s perfectly appropriate. If you sleep with me, we’ll become family, and then I can teach you the ‘Heavenly Rain Descent.'”
Hua Yueying explained.
“Miss Hua, do you like me? Is that why you want me to sleep with you?”
Chen Ping asked.
Hua Yueying shook her head. “No…”
“If you don’t like me, why would you want me to sleep with you? Isn’t that contradictory? Do you really want someone you don’t like to sleep with you?”
Chen Ping was baffled, unable to understand Hua Yueying’s reasoning.
“I want you to sleep with me because I want to become your woman. You have connections and resources. If I become your woman, it will undoubtedly benefit my cultivation.”
“Moreover, I’ve already offended the Divine Hall and the Huo family. Even if they don’t dare to seek revenge against you, they might come after me.”
“I need a sanctuary, and you are undoubtedly the safest option. Plus, I have great confidence in your future.”
Hua Yueying spoke bluntly.
Her desire to sleep with Chen Ping and become his woman was purely for his connections and resources.
In essence, it was a transaction of interests.
“Your father is the ruler of the Northern Region. You could always…”
“I never said I wanted to acknowledge him…” Hua Yueying cut Chen Ping off coldly.
“This…” Chen Ping hesitated.
“Becoming your woman, teaching you the ‘Heavenly Rain Descent,’ and in return, you provide me with resources and protection—isn’t that a good deal?”
Hua Yueying asked.
“It is a good deal, but…” Chen Ping couldn’t shake the feeling that this was akin to selling himself.
“Just because I’m asking you to sleep with me now and don’t like you yet, doesn’t mean I never will. Perhaps after we sleep together and get to know each other better, I might develop feelings for you?”
Hua Yueying smiled faintly.
“Alright, I agree…” Chen Ping said, then promptly pinned Hua Yueying beneath him.
