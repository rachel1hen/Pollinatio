They didn’t know that Chen Ping’s Heart Condensation Technique was a truly superior technique that could absorb and refine everything!
They wanted to suck the spiritual energy from Chen Ping’s body, which was the most stupid thing they could do!
If they had made a move against Chen Ping, Chen Ping might not have been able to deal with it, but these few guys still wanted to suck the spiritual energy from Chen Ping’s body, and this caught Chen Ping right in the middle of it!
“Quickly, back off ……”
The Demon Envoy inside Ning Zhi was yelling frantically!
For even he, the spirit, could feel his life draining away, as if he himself was about to be sucked into Chen Ping’s body and refined!
Several of Ning Zhi’s men were desperately trying to break free from their bonds, each with cold sweat on their foreheads!
When Hu Ma Zi and the others saw this, they all stared in shock and disbelief!
Four Martial Saints plus a Great Martial Marquis had made their move at a crucial moment in Chen Ping’s practice, and they were still made to look terrified and sweaty!
Little did they know that these few people’s breath was being sucked up by Chen Ping at a rapid rate!
Ning Zhi and the others desperately tried to break free, but their palms felt like they were being sucked in, firmly pressed against Chen Ping’s body!
“What kind of gong technique is this, to be so perverse ……”
Ning Zhi said with a look of horror.
“Quickly withdraw your gong power and use pure power to break free, hurry up ……”
The devil amba*sador seemed to know the power of the Heart Condensation Technique within Chen Ping’s body and said in a hurry.
Upon hearing this, Ning Zhi and the others hurriedly collected their spiritual power and used pure strength to break free of Chen Ping, and hurriedly retreated backwards!
Ning Zhi and the four Black Gold Robes looked at Chen Ping incredulously, their eyes filled with doubt!
Buzz ……
Just then, Chen Ping’s body began to erupt in a burst of golden light!
The terrifying aura continued to climb, and Chen Ping’s body was beginning to change, as if Chen Ping’s physical body had been tempered.
Immediately afterwards that terrifying aura shot up into the sky and erupted into a radiant light that lit up the night sky like daylight!
Rumble …………
The whole mountain began to shake as the ground shook and the forest trees that were burning around them all instantly went out under the burst of this aura, while the whole mountain seemed to be collapsing!
Hu Ma Zi and the others fought off the aura bursting out from Chen Ping’s body, and looking at the mountain that was about to collapse, Hu Ma Zi got up inside and helped Jiang Wei, then followed Zheng An Guo’s father and son and ran towards the bottom of the mountain!
It wasn’t that they didn’t want to save Chen Ping, but the aura Chen Ping was emitting was so terrifying that if they stayed there, they would soon be crushed into mush.
Seeing this, Ning Zhi and the four black and gold robes also leapt up in a hurry, and just after they leapt up, the whole mountain began to collapse and Chen Ping was instantly submerged!
Seeing Chen Ping being submerged by the whole mountain, Ning Zhi was a little reluctant to let go of him, not because he couldn’t let Chen Ping die, but because he couldn’t let go of the treasures and secrets Chen Ping was carrying!
Ning Zhi retreated to the foot of the mountain with his four black and gold robes, looking at the whole mountain collapsed, a wreck, smoke and dust covering the entire sky!
“Lord Demon Envoy, this Chen Ping is afraid that he has been buried under the chaotic rocks, right?”
A black and gold robe spoke up and asked Ning Zhi.
Looking at the collapsing great mountain, Ning Zhi didn’t know how to answer.
After all, if such a large mountain collapsed, even if a Martial Saint’s strength was buried, then he would have to resign himself to his fate.
A Martial Saint was not a god, and if he was crushed by the rocks of this mountain, he would not be able to get out.
Even a Martial Saint could not get out, let alone Chen Ping!
“Hurry up and go, this mountain can’t crush that Chen Ping.”
The Demon Envoy inside Ning Zhi seemed to sense something and hurriedly said.
They had just lost a lot of spiritual energy on Chen Ping and had yet to recover, this would be trouble for them if Chen Ping really broke through.
Seeing this, Ning Zhi hurriedly led the four black and gold robes away into the distance!
And as the smoke and dust cleared, Chen Ping’s figure slowly walked out from among the chaotic rocks, not a trace of dust on Chen Ping at this time. They did not know that Chen Ping’s Heart Condensation Technique was a truly superior technique that could absorb and refine everything!
They wanted to suck the spiritual energy from Chen Ping’s body, which was the most foolish thing they could do!
If they had made a move against Chen Ping, Chen Ping might not have been able to deal with it, but these few guys still wanted to suck the spiritual energy from Chen Ping’s body, and this caught Chen Ping right in the middle of it!
