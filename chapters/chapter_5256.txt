That was Zhao Tianyi, whom he met at the city gate!
This guy had said that if Chen Ping ever needed help, he could turn to him, calling himself Chen Ping’s big brother.
Wasn’t this the perfect moment to use Zhao Tianyi’s name?
Thus, Chen Ping slowly uttered a name, “Zhao Tianyi, do you know him?”
“Zhao Tianyi?”
Upon hearing this name, the middle-aged man’s expression changed drastically, a trace of fear flashing in his eyes.
Zhao Tianyi was infamous in Sword Saint City and its surrounding areas, a notorious troublemaker who, backed by his father, the lord of Yu City, acted arrogantly and domineeringly. With considerable strength, ordinary forces dared not provoke him.
Noticing the change in the middle-aged man’s demeanour, Chen Ping understood and continued, “Zhao Tianyi and I are brothers. What do you think he’d do if he knew I was being wronged here?”
The middle-aged man’s face flickered with uncertainty. He was indeed wary of Zhao Tianyi, but the Information Building had operated in Sword Saint City for years, with its own backing. Letting Chen Ping and Hu Mazi leave just like that would make them a laughingstock if word got out.
Gritting his teeth, he forced himself to say, “So what if you know Zhao Tianyi? This is Sword Saint City, not his father’s turf!
A life for a life, a debt repaid with money. You killed someone, so you must stay! Either leave your lives or pay enough immortal stones as compensation, otherwise, don’t even think about leaving!”
He clearly aimed to avoid offending Zhao Tianyi too deeply while salvaging some face by demanding compensation.
Chen Ping looked at him and said slowly, “I’ll say it again, I’m Zhao Tianyi’s brother. If you’re smart, return the million immortal stones, apologise, and this matter might be settled.
Otherwise, when my big brother arrives, forget compensation, your Information Building might not even survive. He’s got a bad temper, and he might just tear down this shabby place.”
“You dare threaten me?”
Chen Ping’s words enraged the middle-aged man. He felt Chen Ping was using Zhao Tianyi to intimidate him, and giving in would make him look too weak.
He laughed in anger, “Zhao Tianyi? He’s nothing! You think my Information Building is scared of him? Even if he were here, you wouldn’t get off easily today!”
Just as he finished speaking, an arrogant voice boomed from outside the Information Building, “Who said I’m nothing? Step forward!”
Before the words faded, a figure stormed in like a gust of wind, none other than Zhao Tianyi.
Behind him followed several lackeys, each exuding menace.
Zhao Tianyi immediately spotted Chen Ping and Hu Mazi surrounded, and the corpse on the ground. He sneered, “What’s the big deal? Just killing a little maid of yours, and your Information Building dares to trouble my brothers?”
Zhao Tianyi strode to Chen Ping’s side, patting his shoulder, “Little brother, you alright? Whoever dares bully you, I’ll crush them!”
Seeing Zhao Tianyi actually show up, the middle-aged man’s face turned ashen, his earlier bravado vanishing. Stammering, he said, “Young… Young Master Zhao, how… how are you here?”
Zhao Tianyi glanced at him sideways, “If I didn’t come, wouldn’t my little brother be bullied to death by a dog like you? Was it you who said I’m nothing?”
The middle-aged man frantically shook his head, “No… it wasn’t me, Young Master Zhao, you misheard, how could I dare say that about you…”
“Bullshit!” one of Zhao Tianyi’s lackeys roared from behind, “We heard it loud and clear outside, it was you, old man, who said it!”
Zhao Tianyi stepped forward, glaring fiercely at the middle-aged man, “Dare to do it but not admit it? I think your Information Building can close its doors!”
Before his words settled, he suddenly struck, moving like lightning, his palm shooting toward the middle-aged man’s chest.
The middle-aged man had no time to react. With a muffled “thud,” he was sent flying like a broken kite, crashing heavily into the wall, spitting blood, clearly not long for this world.
