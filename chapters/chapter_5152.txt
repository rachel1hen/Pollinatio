“Sect Leader Yun,” Chen Ping suddenly turned, a resolute glint flashing in his golden eyes, “take everyone inside, grab everything you can, leave this to me.”
“Mr. Chen, this…!” Yun Wuya exclaimed, “they’re five ninth-grade Loose Immortals!”
“Stop wasting time!” Chen Ping fiercely swung his Dragon-Slaying Sword at the secret vault’s gate, golden sword energy exploding like thunder, blasting the heavy black iron door into dust, “dawdle any longer, and there won’t even be scraps left!”
Hu Mazi, seeing this, instantly perked up, charging into the vault first, “damn it, if we’re late, even the underwear will be gone, hurry up and follow!”
Yun Wuya gritted his teeth, knowing this wasn’t the time to hesitate, and immediately waved his hand, “Qingyun Sect disciples, follow me inside, take all the resources!”
Hundreds of disciples poured in, some carrying spiritual crystals, others collecting treasures, the vault instantly bustling with activity.
“Thinking of taking things?”
Ghost Face sneered, black flames in his right hand surging violently, “stay here!”
The flames transformed into a pitch-black fire snake, shooting towards the vault entrance with an aura of annihilating all.
“Clang!”
Chen Ping instantly raised his sword to block, the moment the Dragon-Slaying Sword met the black fire, dazzling sparks erupted.
He felt an overwhelming force surge through, his arm instantly numb, staggering back three steps before steadying himself, a faint scorch mark left on the sword.
Chen Ping frowned, this guy was clearly no match for him a few days ago, how had his strength suddenly grown?
He glanced at the others, suspecting Ghost Face was somehow drawing power from the other four, making it feel like his strength had surged!
“Interesting.”
The red-robed woman beside Ghost Face gave a charming laugh, nine blood-red ribbons surging like a tide towards Chen Ping, “little brother, my ‘Ten Thousand Charms Silk’ isn’t like the cheap tricks of those Blood Shadow Palace girls…”
Before the ribbons arrived, a sickly sweet fragrance hit him.
Chen Ping felt a wave of dizziness, quickly activating the Mind-Calming Technique, golden light spreading from his brow, instantly dispelling the seductive scent.
But the ribbons were already upon him, each carrying a sharpness that could tear space.
With no time to think, he formed a hand seal, a golden dragon suddenly appearing behind him.
Facing these five, Chen Ping didn’t dare underestimate them, he had to give it his all!
The golden dragon roared, its aura clashing with the ribbons, producing a deafening explosion.
The blood-red ribbons shattered inch by inch, the red-robed woman gasping, blood trickling from her mouth, “a golden dragon? You’re indeed from the Dragon Clan.”
“Dragon Clan?” Greed flashed in Ghost Face’s eyes, “no wonder you can fight above your level, wiping out several sects, your physique could benefit us greatly.”
The bare-chested brute behind him could no longer hold back, roaring as he swung his giant axe, “who cares about his bloodline, chop him in half first!”
The axe came down with immense force, the golden dragon opening its jaws to roar.
With a “crack,” a deep, bone-revealing gash appeared on the dragon’s body.
Chen Ping felt a tightness in his chest, a metallic taste rising in his throat.
At that moment, the figure shrouded in white mist struck, an icy blue finger of wind silently aiming for his back.
“Watch out!”
Hu Mazi’s voice came from the vault, a talisman shooting out, deflecting the icy wind.
But this left Chen Ping exposed, Ghost Face’s black fire snake striking again, aiming for his face.
In the critical moment, Chen Ping bit his tongue, spitting a mouthful of blood onto the Dragon-Slaying Sword.
The sword erupted in radiant golden light, the golden dragon instantly restored, soaring into the sky, its roar shaking the heavens.
“Break!” he roared, the dragon opening its jaws, meeting the black fire snake head-on.
“Boom!”
The heavens seemed torn apart by the clash, the remaining Blood Shadow Palace buildings instantly reduced to dust.
