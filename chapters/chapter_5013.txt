“Young Miss, you didn’t know?” The purple-robed elder was stunned.
“I had no idea!” The white-robed woman shook her head.
The purple-robed elder gave a bitter smile, “This golden dragon bloodline is indeed powerful, but each awakening devours a vast amount of vitality, if it can’t be controlled…”
Before he could finish, the battle in the sky took a sudden turn.
The bone dragon’s claw tore open half of Chen Ping’s body, yet the splattered blood didn’t fall, instead transforming into countless blood needles that pierced back into the bone dragon.
More terrifyingly, the bones struck by the needles began to melt, the purple soul fire tainted with a filthy blood-red hue.
Seeing this, the Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord slammed its palm towards the ground.
The earth trembled violently, the ground beneath everyone’s feet bizarrely softened, turning into a viscous, blood-like substance.
Dozens of blood chains shot up from the depths, dragging the surviving Rhino City warriors underground, their screams cut short as bubbles gurgled in the blood pool.
Bai Yi watched in horror as his legs slowly sank, “What… what kind of sorcery is this?!”
The purple-robed elder hurriedly formed a seal, the thunder seal’s remaining energy creating a barrier to lift everyone, “It’s not sorcery, it’s the Blood Prison Descent of the Demon Soul Hall!”
The bone dragon in the sky let out a pained wail, the corrupted parts of its body spreading rapidly.
From the depths of the mist sea, hundreds of thick black tentacles suddenly extended, covered in sucker-like mouths, frantically tearing at the blood light of Chen Ping’s form.
Each bite drew gouts of blood rain, but the blood corroded the tentacles, releasing bursts of green smoke.
The battlefield became a nightmarish tableau, the sky split between blood mist and black fog, the ground a roiling sea of blood.
The white-robed woman’s face grew grave, a drop of her essence blood dripped into her spear, its decorative patterns glowing.
Acting on instinct, she poured all her power into the spear, its tip erupting with a pure white light.
Wherever the light touched, the blood sea receded, and the black mist dissipated.
The purple-robed elder was shocked, “Young Miss, this Demon-Breaking Holy Light is your life-saving trump card, how could you use it so recklessly?”
The white-robed woman didn’t respond, the spear suddenly shot from her hand, turning into a white rainbow that pierced the heart of the battle.
The world fell silent for a moment.
Then, a white light brighter than the sun exploded, blinding everyone temporarily.
When the light faded, only a near-hundred-metre-wide void black hole remained in the sky, slowly closing.
The bone dragon and Chen Ping had vanished, only the spear stood embedded in the ground, its body covered in cracks.
The white-robed woman staggered to the spear, and the moment she touched it, it crumbled into dust.
A single crystalline droplet fell from the scattered powder, forming a tiny transparent crystal in her palm, within which a faint, pulsing blood thread seemed sealed…
As the dazzling white light faded, the entire battlefield fell into an eerie silence.
Chen Ping’s figure slowly fell from the sky, the golden dragon scales gone, reverting to human form, the golden flames in his vertical pupils fading bit by bit.
He crashed heavily to the ground, red blood beads seeping from the cracks in his skin, his body as if drained of all strength, unable to move even a finger.
Yet, the moment his bloodline power subsided, a far colder aura quietly erupted from deep within him.
It was pure Dao Rune Malevolence, black as ink, carrying a bone-chilling cold, slithering through his meridians like a living thing.
Chen Ping’s eyes snapped open, two eerie black runes appearing in the depths of his pupils, twisting and writhing as if alive.
In the distance, the once-murderous Soul-Devouring Demon Army of the Demon Dragon Hall suddenly halted their assault.
