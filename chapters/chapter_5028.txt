“Fire… Fire Qilin?!”
Huo Zhao’s voice cracked, “This is impossible! How could a first-rank loose cultivator possess a divine beast?!”
The cultivators of Cangxuan Continent were all stunned, mouths agape, too shocked to speak!
“Heavens! That’s a legendary divine beast!”
“Senior Chen actually has a Fire Qilin aiding him!”
Hu Mazi trembled with excitement, “Hahaha! I knew this kid was hiding something!”
The little Fire Qilin glanced disdainfully at Huo Zhao, then transformed into a streak of firelight, returning to the storage ring.
Chen Ping broke free from his restraints, his previously suppressed spiritual power instantly restored, even stronger than before!
“Huo Zhao, did you think you could kill me like this?” Chen Ping sneered coldly, flipping his right hand to reveal the Divine King Bow!
“The Divine King Bow?!”
Huo Zhao’s face changed drastically, a trace of fear finally appearing in his eyes!
“You’re not keeping your word, didn’t we agree no helpers?” Huo Zhao said to Chen Ping!
“I didn’t call for help, that Qilin beast is my pet. If you’re so capable, get a divine beast pet yourself, and I won’t say a word!” Chen Ping smirked coldly!
Huo Zhao’s face looked worse than if he’d eaten filth, where could he possibly get a divine beast pet?
At this moment, Chen Ping slowly drew the bowstring, waves of killing intent surged wildly, and a dazzling arrow, radiant as a star, formed out of thin air!
“This arrow will send you to your grave!”
“Swish!”
The arrow shot forth, dimming the heavens and earth!
Huo Zhao hastily summoned all his defensive treasures, but before the might of the Divine King Bow, all defenses were as fragile as paper!
“Boom!!!”
“Splat!”
Blood gushed like a fountain.
Huo Zhao groaned, stumbling forward, yet he barely managed to steady himself.
He turned with difficulty, his eyes filled with terror as he looked at Chen Ping: “You… who exactly are you?!”
With so many divine weapons and a divine beast pet, what kind of status and background could possess such things?
After all, Chen Ping was only a first-rank Loose Immortal!
Back in the Celestial Realm, Huo Zhao had lost because he was merely a divine soul, his strength restricted!
And Chen Ping had only defeated him by being possessed by another.
But now, Chen Ping, a first-rank Loose Immortal, had defeated him, a fifth-rank Loose Immortal.
Though aided by the Fire Qilin, Chen Ping’s ability to fight above his rank left Huo Zhao utterly shocked.
Chen Ping put away the Divine King Bow, slowly drawing the Dragon-Slaying Sword, pointing it at Huo Zhao, and said coldly: “Someone you can’t afford to provoke.”
With that, Chen Ping’s figure vanished, reappearing in an instant before Huo Zhao, the sword tip aimed at his throat: “Now, do you surrender?”
The scene was eerily silent, even the sound of breathing was audible. Everyone held their breath, awaiting the outcome of this earth-shaking duel.
Huo Zhao’s expression flickered, his eyes flashing with struggle, anger, reluctance… until all emotions turned into deep defeat.
He slowly lowered his head, his voice hoarse: “I… surrender.”
To make someone from the Divine Clan admit defeat was no small feat!
Beyond being utterly shocked by Chen Ping, Huo Zhao also had his pair of children still in Chen Ping’s hands.
“He won! Senior Chen won!”
After a brief silence, the cultivators of Cangxuan Continent erupted into deafening cheers.
Many wept with joy, embracing one another.
The previously despairing elder knelt to the ground, tears streaming down his face: “The heavens have mercy… our Cangxuan Continent is saved…”
Hu Mazi danced with excitement, accidentally tripping over his own robe, falling flat on his back but still laughing heartily, unbothered.
Huo Jingjing collapsed to the ground, her delicate face filled with disbelief: “Impossible… how could Father lose… how could he…”
Her pride was utterly shattered in that moment, her gaze terrifyingly vacant.
