Aisha, shamed by Mad Immortal’s words, quietly asked Chen Ping, “What do we do next? Even if we leave the heavenly prison, there are probably still plenty of soldiers waiting for us.”
“There shouldn’t be many soldiers outside now, we’ll hold them off, you take your people and go.”
Chen Ping said to Aisha.
“We can stick together, there’s strength in numbers.”
Aisha suggested!
Chen Ping shook his head, “You’d only slow us down, you’re no help at all.”
Truthfully, Chen Ping was deeply disappointed when he saw these human cultivators.
So many of them, all in the prime of their lives, yet each one was numb and indifferent.
Chen Ping had been furious seeing the slaughtered elderly, weak, women, and children!
How could these people turn a blind eye?
Those were their kin, their families…
“Thank you, if we manage to escape, one day, if you come to Cangxuan Continent, I’ll treat you well.”
Aisha said!
“Let’s talk about that later!”
Chen Ping dismantled the array at the prison’s entrance and stepped out.
Niu Ben followed closely behind Chen Ping, full of admiration, never straying from his side.
As Chen Ping had predicted, the number of soldiers in the city had noticeably dwindled, and figures could be seen hurriedly heading towards the border between Flying Tiger City and Rhino City.
Not long after Chen Ping and his group left the prison, they encountered a dozen soldiers, armed and patrolling nervously.
When the soldiers saw Chen Ping and his group, they froze.
Both sides fell silent!
The dozen soldiers, seeing the mass of human cultivators behind Chen Ping, trembled slightly.
“Anything found here?”
“Nothing.”
“Let’s patrol another street.”
The soldiers talked among themselves, as if they hadn’t noticed Chen Ping’s group at all, then turned and left!
Chen Ping watched, speechless.
“What’s that about? Are those soldiers blind?”
Mad Immortal asked, puzzled!
“They’re not blind, they’re scared…” Chen Ping smirked, then turned to Aisha, “Go now, if you work together, leaving the city shouldn’t be a problem, no one can stop you.”
“As for how to return to Cangxuan Continent, that’s up to your own fate, I can’t help with that, I’m leaving too.”
“Until we meet again!” Aisha nodded, then led the thousand-plus human cultivators away!
Figures soared into the sky, a dark mass heading out of the city!
As expected, no soldiers rose to intercept them, likely because the city had little manpower left.
“Let’s go too…”
Chen Ping said!
But just as they prepared to leave, the dozen soldiers suddenly doubled back!
Seeing this, Chen Ping couldn’t help but laugh, “Didn’t you say you saw nothing? Why’re you back?”
“Cut the nonsense, who are you people?” one of the soldiers demanded.
“You saw there’s just a few of us left and thought you could take us, so you came back?”
Chen Ping didn’t answer, instead posing his own question.
“Hmph, so what? Your lives are mine…”
The soldier swung his weapon and charged at Chen Ping!
Chen Ping’s eyes flashed with disdain, and with a casual wave of his hand.
Splat!
The soldier was instantly reduced to a pulp by Chen Ping’s palm.
Against this soldier, Chen Ping didn’t even bother using his Dragon-Slaying Sword.
The other soldiers froze, their faces ashen, then turned and fled.
“Spineless cowards…”
Chen Ping snorted coldly, then threw a punch.
The punch sent the dozen soldiers flying, their bodies exploding in mid-air.
Compared to the soldiers inside the heavenly prison, these were noticeably weaker, both in strength and courage.
