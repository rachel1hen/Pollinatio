Though Xiu Rui hadn’t known Chen Ping for long, he was certain that Chen Ping had a powerful background.
“If you don’t heed the words of the experienced, you’ll regret it. You’re as good as dead.”
The middle-aged man said, then distanced himself from Xiu Rui, wary of being implicated.
On the platform, Chen Ping looked at the scarred Long Qi and smiled faintly, “Let’s have a match.”
Long Qi eyed Chen Ping, his gaze narrowing, “Do you know who I am?”
“No, and I don’t need to,” Chen Ping replied with a faint smile.
“I’ll give you a chance. Concede now and get off, or your life’s in danger.”
Long Qi said coldly.
Despite Chen Ping’s unimpressive build, Long Qi wasn’t willing to take risks.
If Chen Ping conceded, Long Qi would only need to defeat one more person to complete his matches.
“I can concede, but you’ll have to pay me…”
Chen Ping said casually.
“How much?” Long Qi began to disdain Chen Ping.
He had initially thought Chen Ping had some backbone, perhaps a strong background, since he didn’t bother picking up immortal coins.
But now, extorting him for coins on the platform, Chen Ping seemed no better than a common thug.
Chen Ping calmly raised one finger.
“A hundred immortal coins isn’t much!”
Long Qi said.
“Not a hundred!” Chen Ping shook his head.
“A thousand?” Long Qi frowned, “You’re extorting me, but fine, I’ll give you a thousand immortal coins today.”
“Not a thousand either, but ten thousand immortal coins.”
Chen Ping stated.
“Damn it, I’ll kill you…”
Long Qi erupted in rage, his muscles tensing, veins bulging on his forehead.
He was clearly furious at Chen Ping’s audacity.
“You’ve fought several matches already, so I’ll let you have three free moves, I won’t dodge!”
Chen Ping said with a faint smile.
“Die…” Long Qi roared, throwing a punch straight at Chen Ping.
Boom!
True to his word, Chen Ping didn’t dodge, standing upright as Long Qi’s fist landed on him.
Chen Ping didn’t budge, nor did Long Qi, but Long Qi’s eyes widened in disbelief as he stared at Chen Ping.
His punch felt like it had struck a steel plate.
Not only did it fail to knock Chen Ping down, but his own arm went numb, his fist feeling as though it had shattered.
Soon, excruciating pain surged through Long Qi’s entire body.
“Judging by your state, you might not need the other two moves.”
Chen Ping said calmly.
Gritting his teeth, Long Qi stepped back, then launched a fierce flying kick at Chen Ping.
Boom!
Chen Ping still didn’t move, but Long Qi felt as though his entire leg had broken.
“You… who the hell are you?”
Long Qi asked, shocked, staring at Chen Ping.
Chen Ping’s physical resilience was absurdly unnatural, how could a body, without relying on any aura, be as hard as steel?
“I just arrived in the Heavenly Realm, so even if I told you my identity, you wouldn’t know.”
Chen Ping replied.
Long Qi glared at Chen Ping, seething, “Kid, you’ve completely crossed me. Even if you’re made of iron, once you leave this platform, I can have you killed anytime.”
“You’ve got one move left, are you taking it or not? If not, get lost, I hate being threatened.”
A cold glint began to flicker in Chen Ping’s eyes.
“Kid, you wait…”
Long Qi gritted his teeth, then shouted, “I concede…”
As Long Qi uttered those three words, the array on the platform deactivated, and he jumped off.
The crowd was stunned, unable to believe that Long Qi, after just one punch and one kick, had voluntarily conceded.
It didn’t match Long Qi’s character at all, but unbeknownst to them, his hand and leg were broken, and without the use of magical aura, he had no way to continue fighting Chen Ping.
