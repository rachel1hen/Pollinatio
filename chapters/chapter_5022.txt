As the head crashed heavily to the ground, the Third Elder’s consciousness finally dissipated in an instant!
A single sword strike…
Everyone looked at Chen Ping in disbelief!
Especially the man, who couldn’t fathom how Chen Ping, a mere first-rank Loose Immortal, had managed it!
The dozen or so black-clad men exchanged glances and then turned to flee!
“They’re escaping, they’re escaping…” the man shouted anxiously!
Chen Ping merely smiled, tossing the Dragon-Slaying Sword with a flick of his hand!
The sword arced through the air, and the black-clad men, who had already fled a hundred miles, all had their heads severed!
A dozen heads soared high before crashing heavily to the ground!
The Dragon-Slaying Sword returned to Chen Ping’s hand, not a drop of blood on it!
The man was stunned, and everyone around was stunned!
“Do you think the few of us can help your Cangxuan Continent overcome this crisis?” Chen Ping asked the man!
The man nodded dumbly, then knelt before Chen Ping, “Saviour, you are the saviour of our Cangxuan Continent…”
“Saviour…”
“Saviour…”
“Saviour…”
Tens of thousands knelt, their shouts resounding through the heavens!
Feeling the scene before him, Chen Ping’s heart was immensely satisfied!
“Feels great, doesn’t it? Next time there’s a chance to show off, can you let me have a go?” Hu Mazi said enviously to Chen Ping!
“Of course, but I’m worried your strength won’t cut it, and instead of showing off, you’ll end up humiliated!” Chen Ping laughed!
“Bullshit, don’t forget, I became an immortal when you were still a tadpole,” Hu Mazi shot Chen Ping a glare!
“You’ve died a few times already, how can you still not see through it? What’s so great about showing off?” Chen Ping sighed!
“If showing off isn’t great, why do you always do it?” Hu Mazi asked!
Chen Ping, “…”
“Who dares to kill the people of our Eight Temples?” a sharp, feminine voice rang out!
A woman clad in white battle armour, her graceful figure accentuated, wearing a golden helmet, her eyes wide with fury, approached rapidly!
Behind her followed a dozen women in black battle armour!
Their aura was far stronger than that of the Third Elder and his group!
“Master Hu, your chance to show off has come, they’re all women…” Chen Ping said with a slight smile!
“Heh heh…” Hu Mazi grinned, drool dripping from his mouth.
Mo Qingyun, standing nearby, frowned slightly.
“Don’t mind him, Miss Mo, Master Hu has no other hobbies, just loves women!” Chen Ping hurriedly explained!
“Sister…” Young Master Huo shouted upon seeing the woman!
Chen Ping was taken aback, surprised, not expecting Huo Zhao to have a daughter.
But the woman didn’t glance at Young Master Huo, instead looking at the dead Third Elder and the others, her face full of rage, “Who killed the Third Elder? Step forward, or I’ll slaughter you all!”
“It was me, I killed him…” Hu Mazi leapt forward, landing in front of the woman!
“Little beauty, I killed your Third Elder, let me apologise to you!” Hu Mazi said with a beaming smile, “Sorry, if you don’t accept my apology, I can offer myself to you.”
“Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do it, absolutely obedient, how’s that?”
As Hu Mazi spoke, he actually started to undo his trousers!
The woman’s face flushed red, glaring at Hu Mazi, “You old lecher, I’ll kill you…”
She suddenly drew a treasured sword, thrusting it straight at Hu Mazi!
“Damn, you’re serious!” Hu Mazi was startled, hastily retreating!
“Stop him, I’ll castrate him myself!” the woman roared!
Soon, the dozen female soldiers in black armour surrounded Hu Mazi!
