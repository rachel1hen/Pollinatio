“What else can we do, of course, we’ll go to the Mo family to demand an explanation!” Elder Tong declared.
“But didn’t the Pavilion Master say not to deal with that Chen Ping, or else my title as a prodigy would be stripped?”
Though Tianci was volatile and killed without hesitation, he was utterly obedient to the Pavilion Master.
He dared not defy the Pavilion Master’s will.
“We’re only going to the Mo family to seek justice, not to bother with that Chen Ping. If Chen Ping steps forward on his own, that’s not our fault.”
Elder Tong’s eyes gleamed with killing intent, “We’ll bring plenty of people. If Chen Ping stays out of it, fine. But if he dares meddle in the Mo family’s affairs, we’ll settle old and new grudges together!”
“Good!” Tianci nodded.
…
Mo Family Council Hall!
Mo Wuji’s face was cold as he prepared to forcibly dismiss everyone, deeming the meeting unnecessary.
But just as Mo Wuji was about to speak, the sky outside the Mo family’s council hall suddenly darkened, and over a dozen grey-robed figures descended like ominous clouds.
Elder Tong, leading them, stood with his hands behind his back, his sinister gaze sweeping over everyone in the hall before settling on Mo Wuji’s face.
Mo Wuji’s pupils shrank, his throat bobbed as he took two steps forward, his shoes scraping harshly against the stone floor.
Trying to remain composed, he raised his hands in a salute, his voice carrying a barely noticeable tremor, “Elder Tong, Young Master Tianci, your visit brings honour to the Mo family…”
“Brings honour?” Elder Tong sneered, his sleeve whipping up a gust of fierce wind that abruptly cut off Mo Wuji’s words.
He stepped through the air, each step pounding on Mo Wuji’s heart, “Mo Wuji, your Mo family has some nerve!”
Tianci followed closely, his face dark as a poisoned blade, his gaze boring into Mo Qingyun as if to pierce her through.
The wound Chen Ping had inflicted on him still throbbed faintly, and now his anger made his eyes bloodshot, “Mo Qingyun, you’ve really outdone yourself!”
Mo Wuji was drenched in cold sweat, his peripheral vision catching his daughter hiding behind Chen Ping. Gritting his teeth, he said, “Elder Tong, this matter… there’s a misunderstanding…”
“Misunderstanding?”
Elder Tong’s hand shot up, a whip of spiritual energy lashing against a hall pillar, sending shards of stone flying and forcing everyone to retreat in alarm.
He pointed at Mo Wuji’s nose, “A misunderstanding about the marriage contract with Tianyuan Pavilion? I ask you, has Mo Qingyun dual-cultivated with this wild man?”
The last three words struck the hall like a hammer, causing an uproar among the Mo family elders. They hadn’t expected Tianyuan Pavilion to know about this.
Mo Qingchen’s eyes flickered, and he stepped forward slightly, a sinister smile curling his lips.
Mo Wuji’s face turned ashen, and he staggered back half a step, his fists clenching tightly under his sleeves to keep from collapsing.
He didn’t dare look at Mo Qingyun but had to speak, “It’s… true. But Elder Tong, this was my daughter’s choice, and the Mo family couldn’t stop her…”
“Couldn’t stop her?”
Tianci roared in fury, a ball of ghostly blue flame forming at his fingertips, “My woman was taken by another man, and you tell me you couldn’t stop her?”
The flame slammed into the ground with a bang, burning a charred hole, “Today, I’ll make the Mo family vanish!”
Tianci’s words sent shivers through the Mo family, their bodies trembling in fear.
They knew Tianyuan Pavilion was truly enraged, or they wouldn’t have brought so many experts!
“Young Master Tianci, please calm down!” Mo Qingchen stepped forward and said, “This was entirely Mo Wuji’s doing and has nothing to do with the rest of the Mo family!”
“But he’s the Mo family head. If he ordered you to act against our Tianyuan Pavilion, would you not obey?”
Elder Tong questioned Mo Qingchen.
The two were clearly performing a scripted act, fully aware of each other’s intentions yet pretending otherwise.
Mo Qingchen turned to glare at Mo Wuji, his eyes filled with malice, “Uncle, you’ve failed to govern the family, allowing your daughter to tarnish the Mo family’s reputation and endanger our clan. For the greater good, I must act. From now on, I’ll take the position of Mo family head!”
