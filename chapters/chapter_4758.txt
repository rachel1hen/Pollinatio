“Mr. Chen, be careful!”
Seeing the situation, Hua Yueying immediately formed hand seals with both hands and began chanting incantations under her breath.
In an instant, a formation unfolded beneath her feet, and countless runes flickered in the air, transforming into a radiant barrier that enveloped Chen Ping.
“Heavenly Protection!” Hua Yueying shouted softly, and the power of the formation instantly surged into Chen Ping, causing his aura to skyrocket and his defenses to strengthen significantly.
The Tenth Hall Master snorted coldly and swung the black blade in his hand once more. The black blade light surged forward like a storm, sweeping toward Chen Ping.
With the help of the formation’s power, Chen Ping barely managed to withstand the Tenth Hall Master’s onslaught. However, with each collision, he could feel the terrifying force impacting his body.
“Clang! Clang! Clang!”
The Dragon-Slaying Sword clashed repeatedly with the black blade, sparks flying in all directions. Chen Ping’s hands were already cracked, blood dripping down the hilt of the sword, but he gritted his teeth and held on.
“Kid, if you can’t hold on, let me take over for a bit…” The Red Cloud Demon Lord’s voice rang out.
“Senior, not yet. I can still hold on a little longer!”
Chen Ping replied.
The reason Chen Ping had the confidence to come to the Tenth Hall and cause trouble was precisely because of the Red Cloud Demon Lord’s presence.
If things truly became desperate, he would let the Red Cloud Demon Lord take control of his body and unleash a bloodbath!
“Mr. Chen, hold on!”
Hua Yueying’s voice came from behind. The power of her formation continuously poured into Chen Ping’s body, helping him resist the Tenth Hall Master’s attacks.
Finally, during one particularly fierce collision, the black blade in the Tenth Hall Master’s hand let out a crisp cracking sound, and a fissure appeared on its surface.
The Tenth Hall Master’s expression changed, but before he could react, the sword energy from the Dragon-Slaying Sword was already upon him.
“Crack—!”
Under the relentless assault of the Dragon-Slaying Sword, the black blade finally gave way and shattered completely!
“What?!”
The Tenth Hall Master stared in shock at the fragments of the black blade in his hand, his eyes filled with disbelief.
This black blade was his life-bound spiritual weapon, one that housed a weapon spirit. Yet, it had been shattered by Chen Ping’s Dragon-Slaying Sword!
“Chen Ping, how dare you destroy my spiritual weapon!”
The Tenth Hall Master roared in fury, his aura surging violently. Behind him, a hundred-zhang-tall dharma manifestation materialized! The manifestation had a ferocious face and wielded a giant axe, as if it intended to destroy everything in its path.
“Dharma Manifestation: World-Destroying Deity!”
The Tenth Hall Master shouted, and the giant axe in the manifestation’s hands swung down with a force capable of annihilating the heavens and the earth, heading straight for Chen Ping!
Chen Ping felt the terrifying power and was momentarily stunned, but he didn’t retreat. Instead, he tightened his grip on the Dragon-Slaying Sword and charged forward.
“Dragon God’s Power!”
Chen Ping shouted, and the Dragon-Slaying Sword erupted with a dazzling golden light. A golden dragon flew out from the blade, heading straight for the Tenth Hall Master’s dharma manifestation.
“Boom—!”
The dragon collided with the giant axe, producing a deafening explosion that shook the entire hall. The ground trembled violently, as if the heavens and earth were on the verge of collapse.
The battle between Chen Ping and the Tenth Hall Master had reached its peak. The clash of their powers caused the entire space to tremble.
Hua Yueying, meanwhile, was fully focused on maintaining the formation, using its power to help Chen Ping resist the Tenth Hall Master’s attacks.
“We must win!”
Hua Yueying silently chanted in her heart, continuously channeling the formation’s power into Chen Ping’s body to help him withstand the Tenth Hall Master’s terrifying strength.
The battle raged on, with no clear victor in sight. However, Chen Ping’s gaze grew increasingly determined. He knew that this fight wasn’t just for himself—it was for everyone who had placed their trust in him!
Xuan Bin and the others had followed him here despite the danger. Even if their motives were driven by self-interest, the fact that they were willing to risk their lives and fight alongside him in the Tenth Hall made them his brothers!
Chen Ping took a deep breath, and the various powers within his body surged wildly. The golden light on the Dragon-Slaying Sword grew even more radiant.
With a powerful leap, Chen Ping shot forward like a bolt of lightning, heading straight for the Tenth Hall Master’s dharma manifestation.
He was going all out!
Chen Ping’s physical body had been tempered and strengthened, and with the Indestructible Golden Body protecting him, coupled with Hua Yueying’s support, he knew that even in a head-on clash, his life wouldn’t be in danger!
