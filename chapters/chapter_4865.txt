“Emperor Lin, I didn’t have one before, but I do now! And my daughter has long been intimate with Chen Ping!”
The Northern Domain Lord said!
Upon hearing this, Hua Yueying’s face flushed with embarrassment. Having slept with Chen Ping, she naturally carried his bloodline aura, which could be detected with a simple probe.
“You old fool, a mere seventh-grade Transcendent Immortal, and you dare to stand in my way?”
The Guardian glared at the newly arrived Northern Domain Lord, roaring coldly!
“I can’t stop you alone, but what about the five of us?”
As he spoke, four more terrifying auras descended from the horizon!
The Domain Lords of the East, South, West, North, and Central regions had all arrived!
Chen Ping recognised the Southern Domain Lord, the Western Domain Lord, and the Northern Domain Lord, having met them before. The other two were somewhat unfamiliar!
Especially the Western Domain Lord, who had fled in terror the moment Mr. Shi appeared last time!
“Little friend, long time no see! The five of us old-timers are here to help you, so don’t be afraid!”
The Western Domain Lord approached Chen Ping, speaking with an obsequious smile!
Seeing the Western Domain Lord fawn over Chen Ping like this, everyone was utterly bewildered!
Especially Lin Chong, who couldn’t figure out what had gotten into the Western Domain Lord to act so servile toward Chen Ping!
The Northern Domain Lord, watching the Western Domain Lord’s behaviour, couldn’t help but chuckle. Only he knew that the Western Domain Lord had been scared witless the whole way here!
“Senior, thank you for stepping in to help!”
Chen Ping smiled faintly!
“No need to be polite! Since you’re the Northern Domain Lord’s son-in-law, we’re family. Rest assured!”
The Western Domain Lord finished, then turned to the Guardian, “You dim-witted giant, the five of us will take you on and see if we can kill you!”
With that, the Western Domain Lord struck first, eager to put on a good show for Chen Ping!
The other four Domain Lords joined in, attacking the Guardian together!
The Guardian, facing them, engaged in a fierce battle with the five Domain Lords!
Ming Shao watched the five Domain Lords appear, his brows slightly furrowed, his face showing disbelief!
He couldn’t understand why these five old recluses, who hadn’t meddled in worldly affairs for years, were suddenly helping Chen Ping!
Could there be some powerful figure backing Chen Ping, prompting these five old men to curry favour?
“Got anyone else? I can wait for you to call more people!”
“Got anyone else? I can wait for you to call more people!”
Chen Ping looked at Ming Shao, taunting him with a smug tone!
Ming Shao’s face darkened. He never allowed anyone to outshine him in bravado, yet here was Chen Ping, showing off right in front of him!
His body trembled with rage, his face red with fury, but he truly had no one left to summon!
Now, he could only hope the Qian Gate Guardian would defeat the five Domain Lords, tipping the scales back in his favour!
Booming sounds echoed from the horizon as bursts of light erupted continuously!
In the span of a few breaths, several figures slowly emerged!
The Guardian’s expression was grim, though the five Domain Lords didn’t look much better!
“Forget it, I’m only here because of a promise. It’s not worth dying over. I’m out!”
With that, the Guardian turned and left!
Soon, his figure vanished into the horizon, leaving Qian Xiaohan staring in dumbfounded shock!
What kind of guardian was this?
Running at the first sign of danger—what a joke!
Ming Shao stood on his bone ship, casting a cold glance at Qian Xiaohan and Huo Zhenfeng, “Useless…”
Neither dared to speak. After all, their life or death hinged on Ming Shao’s word!
Without the protection of the Four Nether Palaces, Chen Ping would’ve wiped them out long ago!
“Good thing there’s the suppression of the Heaven and Earth Array, or the five of us wouldn’t have stood a chance against that big oaf!”
The Northern Domain Lord took a deep breath, speaking with a hint of shock!
Seeing the five Domain Lords emerge victorious, Chen Ping’s expression instantly turned mocking!
“You bunch of idiots, teaming up with that Ming Shao to target me. Bet you didn’t expect I’d have people backing me too, huh?”
“Since you chose to side with Ming Shao, don’t blame me for not holding back!”
Chen Ping finished, then turned to the five Domain Lords, “Seniors, I hope you’ll step in and help me wipe out the Qian Gate and the Huo family!”
“Son-in-law, no problem!”
The Northern Domain Lord nodded, then said to the other Domain Lords, “Brothers, time to get to work!”
The five Domain Lords charged toward Qian Xiaohan, Huo Zhenfeng, and their group!
