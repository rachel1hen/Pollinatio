The Inspector’s gaze towards Chen Ping grew increasingly icy, a murderous intent rising!
Chen Ping, feeling the Inspector’s killing intent, tightly gripped the Dragon-Slaying Sword with his right hand, his expression extremely grave!
Facing the Inspector, who had already transformed into a divine dragon, Chen Ping dared not be the slightest bit careless, or he might lose his life!
“Senior, if I can’t hold my own later, you must quickly possess me and lend a hand!”
Chen Ping said to the Red Cloud Demon Lord!
“No way!” The Red Cloud Demon Lord, lounging with legs crossed in Chen Ping’s sea of consciousness, was utterly carefree.
Chen Ping was stunned, slightly angry, “Damn, you eat my food, drink my wine, live in my space, and now you say such cold words, where’s your conscience?”
“Don’t always rely on me, kid. Have some confidence in yourself, push yourself a bit. If you don’t push yourself, how will you know how useless you are?” The Red Cloud Demon Lord chuckled!
“Bloody hell…” Chen Ping was speechless!
At that moment, the Inspector suddenly vanished. Chen Ping frowned, and in the next moment, gripping the Dragon-Slaying Sword, he stepped forward, then fiercely swung a sword downward!
Boom!
As the sword slashed, Chen Ping instantly felt a massive force resisting, and then his body was sent flying backwards!
The Inspector revealed himself, throwing a punch towards Chen Ping!
This punch, filled with intense, terrifying killing intent, caused the world to lose its colour in an instant.
Chen Ping knew that if this punch hit, even if he didn’t die, he’d be gravely injured!
But just as the Inspector’s punch was about to strike Chen Ping, a long spear suddenly shot through the air!
Boom!
The immense force sent the Inspector staggering back!
Then, a girl in white appeared, holding a long spear, with a Qiankun Ring around her neck!
All she needed was to step on Wind-Fire Wheels…
“A grand Inspector of the Divine Hall, yet you attack a junior, have you no shame?”
The girl in white questioned the Inspector, her eyes showing no trace of fear.
“Who are you?” The Inspector frowned, staring intently at the girl in white.
The girl ignored him, turning to the injured Chen Ping, “Are you alright?”
“I’m fine!” Chen Ping shook his head, “Thank you for saving me, miss.”
“It’s I who should thank you, for saving so many people in the Cangxuan Continent.” The girl in white gave a slight smile!
Chen Ping was slightly stunned, “Miss, are you from the Cangxuan Continent?”
The girl in white shook her head.
As Chen Ping and the girl were talking, the Inspector grew furious, roaring, “You’re courting death…”
As his voice fell, the Inspector waved his palm forward, unleashing a terrifying force that seemed to compress the entire space instantly.
Chen Ping and the girl in white felt their bodies as if bound.
“Hmph, overestimating yourself…”
The girl snorted coldly, then with a flick of her wrist, thrust her spear forward!
Boom!
This spear pierced through the terrifying force, but the force didn’t weaken, pushing the girl in white back repeatedly!
Seeing this, Chen Ping’s Dragon-Slaying Sword let out a dragon’s roar and slashed fiercely!
This sword shattered the terrifying force.
Chen Ping was about to catch his breath when the Inspector appeared right in front of him.
With no time to swing his sword, Chen Ping could only throw a punch with all his might!
“Holy Light Fist…”
Boom!
As he threw the punch, Chen Ping felt a lightness behind him, his entire body pulled back by the girl in white!
“Don’t clash with him, you’re not his match!”
With that, the girl thrust her spear, purple light flashing at the tip!
The Inspector’s expression changed, and he threw a punch with his left hand!
“Mo Family Spear?” The Inspector shouted as he threw the punch.
“Didn’t expect you to be so knowledgeable.”
The girl in white swiftly retreated, and with a shake of her spear, countless spear shadows appeared before the Inspector.
