When Mo Chen unbuttoned Chen Ping’s shirt and saw the deep, bone-revealing wound, he couldn’t help but gasp. “Zhao Jingfeng is absolutely despicable!”
Chen Ping gave a faint smile and said calmly, “It’s fine. I won’t die.”
“Fine?” Ling Xue glared at him reproachfully, carefully cleaning the wound with spiritual spring water. “Do you know how dangerous that was? If Qin Lie had really attacked, we couldn’t have stopped him!”
Hu Mazi, standing nearby, praised Chen Ping enthusiastically. “Chen Ping, you’re incredible! That ‘Dragon Ascend Style’ was absolutely stunning! When Zhao Jingfeng was split in half, I nearly jumped for joy!”
While applying medicine to Chen Ping, Mo Chen said gravely, “Divine Sword Manor will not let this go. Qin Fenglie is the type to hold a grudge. After losing face like this, he’ll surely scheme against you in secret. I suggest you leave Sword Saint City to avoid the spotlight for now.”
Chen Ping nodded. “Once we get the champion’s reward, we’ll leave immediately.”
Even without Mo Chen’s advice, Chen Ping and Hu Mazi had already planned to leave Sword Saint City to seek out the branch hall of the Evil Path Temple.
At the mention of the champion’s reward, Ling Xue’s eyes lit up. “I heard this time’s champion will receive Sword Saint City’s treasured ‘Sword Heart Clarity Pill’ and a chance to meditate in the ‘Ten Thousand Swords Grotto’ for three days!”
“Sword Heart Clarity Pill?” Chen Ping asked, puzzled. “What’s that?”
“It’s a pill that can enhance your sword intent,” Ling Xue explained.
Chen Ping looked at Mo Chen in disbelief. He had never heard of a pill that could improve something as intangible as sword intent.
“Exactly,” Mo Chen said with a smile. “With this pill, your sword intent barrier might fully transform into a sword domain.”
“That would boost your strength significantly.”
“What about the Ten Thousand Swords Grotto?” Chen Ping asked curiously.
“The Ten Thousand Swords Grotto is…”
Mo Chen began, but just then, footsteps approached from outside the courtyard. A disciple from Sword Saint City stood respectfully at the door. “Young Master Chen, Master Zhang requests your presence to distribute the Swordsmanship Tournament rewards.”
Chen Ping stood up, a hint of anticipation on his face. “Let’s go.”
When Chen Ping reappeared in the grand hall of Sword Saint City, all eyes were on him.
The sect leaders and elders on the VIP platform rose to greet him, their gazes filled with goodwill. A genius capable of standing up to Divine Sword Manor was someone everyone wanted to befriend.
Master Zhang, holding an ornate box, announced loudly, “The Swordsmanship Tournament has concluded successfully. This year’s champion is Chen Ping!”
Thunderous applause erupted, louder than ever before.
Master Zhang handed the box to Chen Ping. “Inside is the Sword Heart Clarity Pill and the entry token for the Ten Thousand Swords Grotto. In three days, I will personally escort you to the grotto.”
Chen Ping took the box and was about to express his thanks when a disciple hurriedly entered and whispered something to Master Zhang.
Master Zhang’s expression turned grave.
He looked at Chen Ping and said solemnly, “Chen Ping, I’m afraid you can’t stay in Sword Saint City for long. Before leaving, Qin Fenglie sent a message to various sects allied with Divine Sword Manor, claiming you possess a rare treasure and are a ruthless killer, calling for all cultivators to unite against you.”
Mo Chen’s face darkened. “He’s trying to slander Chen Ping and make him a target for everyone!”
“Despicable!” Ling Xue said angrily.
Master Zhang sighed. “Divine Sword Manor holds immense influence in the swordsmanship world. Many sects will give them face. It won’t be long before trouble comes your way.”
“After all, besides swordsmanship, Divine Sword Manor is renowned for its forging techniques. Many sects purchase their spiritual swords from them, so they’ll likely honour this request.”
Chen Ping tightened his grip on the box, a cold glint flashing in his eyes. “They want to gang up on me? Let them try…”
