However, Mu Sha’s strength had been depleted within the Skyward Ladder, now reduced to less than a third of its original might!
“As expected of a Heavenly Realm cultivator, but sadly, with your strength now barely a tenth of what it was, you’re no match for me!”
Wen Nanxing showed no fear, throwing a punch of his own!
The collision of their forces sent a terrifying pressure rippling out to everyone around!
Even though the area of their fight was sealed off, the waves of residual energy still instilled fear in all who felt them!
Even Heavenly Realm cultivators like Nan Batian and Li Chunfeng watched the battle with grave expressions!
In a place like the Celestial Realm, these Heavenly Realm cultivators held no advantage at all!
For Wen Nanxing to claim the throne of the Celestial Realm’s top power, his strength was undoubtedly formidable!
Moreover, at the peak of the Immortal Transformation Realm, he wasn’t far off from being an immortal himself!
That punch just now, they reckoned none of them could have withstood it!
Lin Chong’s expression grew even more serious, though he ranked third among Celestial Realm cultivators, he felt leagues behind Wen Nanxing!
If he were the one facing Wen Nanxing, that single punch would’ve likely reduced him to ashes!
Wen Nanxing’s power was simply too terrifying.
Wen Qing, Wen Shi, and the other Fire Incineration Sect members watched Wen Nanxing’s fearsome punch with unbridled excitement!
In the Celestial Realm, Wen Nanxing was an invincible existence!
After that punch, Wen Nanxing didn’t pause, launching yet another strike!
What seemed like an ordinary punch carried the power of the Great Dao, it appeared Wen Nanxing had already grasped the Heavenly Dao and could ascend to the Heavenly Realm at any moment!
Seeing this, Mu Sha clenched his right fist and threw a punch in return!
True masters clashed with such unadorned moves!
Boom!
A fearsome surge of Great Dao power gathered in Mu Sha’s palm before blasting outward!
As a Heavenly Realm cultivator, wielding the power of the Great Dao was second nature to Mu Sha, though with his strength diminished, even this strike lacked its former potency!
As Mu Sha’s punch roared forth, the cage erupted in flames, and the moment their fists collided, the cage could no longer hold, shattering with a deafening explosion!
Waves of terrifying energy surged outward in all directions!
Everyone’s faces paled as they scrambled back!
The Land of No Return began to crumble bit by bit, with only the Skyward Ladder struggling to hold it together!
Some cultivators from Sun-Moon City and the Fire Incineration Sect, too slow to retreat, were caught by the horrific force, instantly reduced to ashes, not a trace left behind!
Seeing those cultivators obliterated, everyone gasped in shock, retreating further, only able to watch from a distance, none daring to approach!
“Even with his strength suppressed, Mu Sha is still this terrifying, no wonder he could hold the fourth level!”
Li Chunfeng said with a sigh of awe!
“And he chose to imprison himself on the fourth level, that alone is something none of us could ever match!”
Shen Zhiyan added with a resigned breath!
All eyes were fixed on the battle between Mu Sha and Wen Nanxing, the area where they fought had long descended into chaos, with space and time twisting and warping.
Soon, another massive boom rang out, followed by relentless shockwaves!
The crowd retreated again as the Land of No Return finally gave way, collapsing entirely!
In the end, the Land of No Return vanished, enveloped by the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, even the Skyward Ladder couldn’t preserve it!
The terrifying aftershocks continued unabated, Wuji Daoist glanced at Chen Ping beneath the Heaven and Earth Array, frowning, “This isn’t good, these shockwaves might reach Chen Ping!”
With that, Wuji Daoist flew toward Chen Ping first, followed by Lin Chong, Nan Batian, Li Chunfeng, Shen Zhiyan, and the Five Domain Lords!
They positioned themselves in front of Chen Ping, unleashing bursts of energy to shield him from the fearsome aftershocks!
Wen Nanxing kept hammering away, punch after punch, as if his strength were inexhaustible!
