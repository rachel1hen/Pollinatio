The black-robed cultivators surged forward like a tide, and a bloody massacre erupted instantly.
A trace of sorrow flashed in Sang Tianyang’s eyes. He fiercely pushed Sang Lan towards the secret passage entrance, “Go! I’ll hold them off!”
With that, he ignited his essence blood, his aura surging explosively, activating the forbidden move of the “Asura Soul-Destroying Slash” at the cost of his life!
“Father!”
Tears streamed down Sang Lan’s face, but she knew this was no time for hesitation.
Gritting her teeth, she turned and rushed into the secret passage, her figure instantly enveloped in a white light.
Behind her came her father’s earth-shaking roars, the enemies’ screams, and the bone-chilling laughter of the androgynous monster.
Sang Lan knew the journey ahead would be fraught with danger; Tianyuan Pavilion’s forces had likely sealed all exits.
But she had to find Chen Ping as quickly as possible, for her father, for Asura Hall.
Clutching the Blood-Weeping Blade tightly, the blood-red veins on the blade seemed to sense its master’s resolve, pulsing with increasing fervour.
…
In the Eight Halls, within the Demon-Suppressing Tower!
Chen Ping sat cross-legged inside the tower, surrounded by a cyan halo that had solidified, encasing him like a cocoon.
Two days in the outside world were but a fleeting moment, yet within the tower, months had passed.
As the final strand of immortal qi merged into his dantian, he snapped his eyes open, a flash of brilliance passing through them, with two flickering golden flames reflected deep in his pupils.
“The injuries are fully healed, and even…”
Chen Ping touched his chest, where the cracks left by the Red Cloud Demon Lord’s possession and forced activation had vanished, replaced by a near-boiling sense of power.
Emerging from the tower, Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun, who had been waiting outside, greeted him with evident concern. Seeing Chen Ping fully recovered, with an even stronger aura, both broke into smiles!
Just as Chen Ping smiled and was about to speak, his body suddenly shuddered!
Two forces within him began to surge chaotically, as if trying to break free from his body!
“The two warriors?” Chen Ping frowned.
He couldn’t understand why the two warriors, long subdued and residing within him, were suddenly acting up!
To prevent their power from disrupting his aura, Chen Ping released them.
With two streams of black qi erupting from his body, the two warriors appeared!
But the moment they emerged, they vanished with a whoosh, speeding off in a direction!
“Hey!”
Chen Ping shouted, chasing after them.
He had no idea what was wrong with the warriors or why they had suddenly fled.
“Chen Ping!”
Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun, seeing this, hurriedly followed.
“Sister!” Huo Feng arrived at that moment, noticing Chen Ping and the others leaving and rushing to catch up.
“Chen Ping, what’s happening?” Huo Jingjing asked as she caught up.
“No time to explain!”
Chen Ping spoke rapidly, pointing in the direction the warriors had gone, “Those two went out of control for some reason and I don’t know where they’re headed! We have to follow!”
The group chased the warriors’ forms, ripples appearing in the void behind them, a testament to their speed!
The wind howled in their ears as mountains and rivers blurred past below.
Chen Ping closed his eyes, tracking the warriors’ position through his soul thread. Their aura grew increasingly frenzied, faintly resonating with a thick scent of blood.
“Something’s off,” Chen Ping murmured, “The warriors seem to be… responding to some kind of summons.”
“Isn’t this the direction of Asura Hall?” Mo Qingyun glanced around and said.
