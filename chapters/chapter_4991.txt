Chen Ping rummaged through the bodies of the fallen soldiers, finding nothing of value, it was clear these soldiers were weak and had few resources.
“Let’s go, we should leave amidst the chaos!”
With that, Chen Ping led Mad Immortal and the others towards the city’s outskirts.
But just as he leaped, intending to fly out of the city, a squad of soldiers suddenly blocked their path.
“Finally found you,” said Prince Huo, his face full of rage, gritting his teeth.
Seeing it was Prince Huo with only a few soldiers, Chen Ping couldn’t help but laugh.
“You’re looking for us with just these few men?”
Chen Ping smirked.
“Don’t talk about these few men, even if it were just me, taking you down would be child’s play.”
“I don’t care who you are, surrender quietly, and you’ll avoid physical suffering,” Prince Huo snorted coldly.
“Ugh, why do you God Clan people love to show off so much? Do you die if you don’t act superior?” Chen Ping said, exasperated.
What was so great about this self-proclaimed God Clan, with their so-called noble bloodline?
Yet every one of them was smug and looked down on others.
Prince Huo was taken aback, frowning slightly, “You know my identity?”
“I don’t just know your identity, isn’t your father Huo Zhao, the Eighth Hall Master of the Temple?”
“Come to think of it, your father was defeated by me, so you’re even less of a match,” Chen Ping said with a faint smile.
This left Prince Huo utterly stunned, staring at Chen Ping in disbelief, unable to fathom how he knew his father’s identity.
Their control over Flying Tiger City through the Eight Halls was a closely guarded secret, unknown to outsiders.
The city’s lord, Jie Zhong, was always the one appearing in public.
How did this Chen Ping suddenly know their secrets?
“Who the hell are you? How do you know my father?”
“You’re just a minor cultivator who’s barely reached the Loose Immortal Realm, how could you possibly defeat my father?” Prince Huo refused to believe it.
“When I defeated your father, I was only at the Transformation Realm, if it were now, I could make your father kneel and beg for mercy with one hand,” Chen Ping said without exaggeration.
Because Chen Ping was telling the truth, though he didn’t mention that he had been possessed by the Red Cloud Demon Lord to defeat Huo Zhao.
“How dare you disrespect our Hall Master, you deserve to die…”
At that moment, a soldier stepped forward, his aura surging wildly, enveloping Chen Ping in an instant.
It seemed the soldiers Prince Huo brought were likely disguised Temple members.
Their aura was distinctly different from the city’s soldiers.
“Insolent, how dare you speak to my big brother like that?”
Mad Immortal roared, then struck out with a palm!
The soldier was instantly sent flying by Mad Immortal, his body exploding mid-air into a pile of gore.
Having endured centuries in the Purgatory Arena, Mad Immortal’s strength was far beyond these minor lackeys from the Eight Halls.
Seeing this, Prince Huo’s expression turned grim.
Recalling Chen Ping’s earlier use of time manipulation techniques, Prince Huo felt a twinge of fear.
Due to the teleportation array, he hadn’t brought many men.
Most of the city’s soldiers had been dispatched to the border to fend off enemies, leaving just them, who might not be a match for Chen Ping.
“Kid, since you know I’m from the Temple, you still dare to oppose us, are you really not afraid of death?”
Prince Huo tried to intimidate Chen Ping with the Temple’s reputation.
“Hahaha…” Chen Ping laughed heartily, “Forget a minor Eighth Hall Prince like you, even a Hall Master, I’d kill if I wanted to.”
“The Tenth Hall was destroyed by me, the Tenth Hall Master is now my subordinate, the Ninth Hall Master died the moment he appeared, do you think I’d fear a petty Eighth Hall Prince like you?”
Chen Ping said arrogantly.
