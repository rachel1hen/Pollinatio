Faced with these wind blades that seemed to possess spirituality, Chen Ping’s heart stirred and remembered the Wind Fixing Bead that he was carrying.
This bead had been a treasure for manipulating the wind element since ancient times, capable of fixing all storms in the world and even absorbing the essence of wind.
Chen Ping’s mind moved, and the Wind Fixing Bead slowly rose from within him and hovered above his head, emitting a faint blue light that contrasted sharply with the chaotic darkness around him.
“Let me try if this Wind Fixing Bead can take in all these strange wind blades.”
Chen Ping whispered, his eyes glittering with curiosity and anticipation.
As his mind guided him, the blue light on the surface of the Wind Fixing Bead became more and more dazzling, as if it was a huge vortex that began to slowly rotate, attracting the surrounding wind blades.
Those wind blades that were originally roaming around, looking for opportunities to attack, after encountering the suction force released by the Wind Stabilizing Bead, they actually changed their direction coincidentally, as if they were being pulled by an invisible rope, and flew towards the Wind Stabilizing Bead.
The moment each wind blade approached the Wind Stabilizing Bead, it was gently wrapped by the blue light on its surface, and then transformed into a wisp of pure wind essence, which was slowly absorbed by the bead.
This process was both silent and full of a mysterious and unpredictable sense of power, causing Chen Ping to wonder.
As time passed, the wind blades within the gourd became less and less until they completely disappeared.
The wind-determining bead became more warm and translucent, as if it had absorbed the wind’s spiritual charm between heaven and earth, and the connection between it and Chen Ping was also more tightly knit.
Chen Ping could feel that through this process, his understanding and control of the wind element had taken a qualitative leap.
“Indeed, this is not just a simple wind blade attack, it is a direct display of the origin of wind.”
Chen Ping came to a realization as a wave of clarity surged in his heart, “Through the medium of the Wind Stabilizing Pearl, I was able to glimpse the mysteries of the Origin of Wind, this gain is far more precious than escaping this gourd.”
After thoroughly absorbing all the wind blades, Chen Ping closed his eyes and concentrated, and began to carefully comprehend the wind elements surging within his body.
He realized that his perception of wind had become sharper than ever before, and he was even able to detect the subtle changes of every single wind flow in the air.
The Origin of Wind, this Origin of the Five Elements, was now as if it was within reach.
Within Chen Ping’s Origin Space, the star of the Origin of Wind, slowly radiated a light, although this light was not very bright, but Chen Ping knew that as long as he had the opportunity to be absorbing the Origin of Wind, this star would become brighter and brighter!
At this time, the gourd outside of Master Luan is proudly to Qiu Tintu show their “masterpiece”, but do not know that the gourd within the Chen Ping is experiencing a metamorphosis.
Inside the gourd, Chen Ping slowly opened his eyes, eyes flashing with confidence.
He took a deep breath, as if incorporating the entire space within the gourd into his chest, and then gently pushed with both hands, only to see layers of ripples in the emptiness of the inner wall of the gourd, and a tiny crack quietly appeared and rapidly expanded.
“It’s time to go out.”
Chen Ping whispered, and his figure transformed into a stream of light, easily penetrating the gourd and reentering the real world.
The “Heaven Swallowing Gourd” that had once been praised by the crowd was now lying quietly on the ground, its surface cracked, obviously having lost its former power.
Seeing this, Master Luan’s face instantly turned pale, staring incredulously at everything in front of him.
And Chen Ping’s appearance was even more like a heavy hammer that ruthlessly smashed into everyone’s hearts.
Especially Qian Yue, he wanted to continue mining immortal spirit stone, but did not expect a few moments of effort, Chen Ping unexpectedly came out from within the so-called Heaven Swallowing Gourd, at this moment, Qian Yue’s eyes are full of panic and despair.
At this time on the other side, the youngest sister brother is escorting the youngest sister and Xiong broad two siblings, toward the side of the dense forest to go!
He wants to kill all the people in that dense forest!
