** A slight blow, but did not feed the white feathered crow spirit stone, but continue to approach the white feathered crow.
See ** do not listen to their own, Lin Keting has angry: “You this guy, remind you still do not listen, a moment that the white feathered crows attack you, you can not cry …….”
** Just laughed, and then continuously towards the white feathered crow close.
In the distance from the white feathered crow is only a few metres, two white feathered crows become alert, eyes staring at **, ** in close, they are going to launch an attack.
Lin Keting watched from the side, she wanted to see ** being attacked by the White Feathered Crow.
She wanted to see how ** was attacked by the White Feathered Crow that made this guy disobedient!
But as ** got closer and closer to the White Feathered Crow, the aura of the Dragon Bloodline slowly began to emanate from his body.
Although ** can suppress all kinds of power, there is no way to suppress their own bloodline breath!
When the Dragon Bloodline Breath was released, the two white-feathered crows were instantly terrified out of their wits.
The body is shaking slightly!
** The White Feathered King approached the White Feathered Crow, then reached out and began to stroke it, the White Feathered King being as docile as a little sheep in general, not even daring to move!
The two white feathered crows, casually ** caress which one, do not dare to move!
This time, Lin Keting directly some confused, she did not understand, ** in the end how to do it!
I won’t be able to do that. The other people see ** did not feed the spirit stone, the white feathered crow also let touch, so also want to go to try!
But just close, the white feathered crow on the chirp, launched an attack, the cultivator scared “to run away!
“Come back ……”
** shouted, which launched the attack of the white feathered crow, but really very obedient, stopped the attack, turned around and went back.
Now the other people are also confused, do not understand how these two white feathered crows will listen to the words of **?
Only to see ** in the crowd’s confusion, directly mounted a White Feathered Crow, and then gently call, White Feathered Crow immediately rose into the air!
Sitting on the White Feathered Crow, ** can see higher and farther.
Lin Keting was shocked to see the White Feathered Crow flying with **, and her heart also stirred with the desire to win, so she headed towards the other White Feathered Crow.
She also wanted to get on the White Feathered Crow and let it carry her into the sky.
Lin Keting tried several times, but was thrown off by the White Feathered Crow.
“You big bird, I feed you so many Spirit Stones, why do you only let me touch it and not let me ride it?”
Lin Ke Ting was very angry as he stared at the roaring White Feathered Crow.
“Let her ride it ……”
** shouted in the air at the white feathered crow underground.
Hearing **’s shout, the white feathered crow slowly lay down and let Lin Ke Ting ride on his own body!
The two White Feathered Crow with ** and Lin Keting, Ao Xiang in the air! The crowd watched enviously from below.
If they hadn’t been suppressed, they would have been able to fly in the air and there would have been nothing to envy.
But in this battlefield of gods and demons, all of them had suppressed their powers, not to mention flying, even walking for a long time was tiring.
Lin Ke Ting sat on the White Feathered Crow and looked at ** and asked, “What’s wrong with you? Why does the White Feathered Crow listen to you?”
“I don’t know, maybe it’s because he’s closer to me.”
** he replied!
There was no way he was going to tell Lin Keting about his dragon bloodline.
“Nonsense.” Lin Ke Ting gave ** a blank look.
“Then why do you think you know everything about the Divine Demon Battlefield like the back of your hand? Even those White Feathered Crows know what kind of character they have.”
Humans?” “Did you enter the Divine Demon Battlefield a long time ago?What exactly are you?
**He looked at Lin Keting and asked.
He was just too curious about Lin Keting’s identity.
“I won’t tell you… ……”
Lin Ke Ting smiled and then charged at the White Feathered Crow!
