The black-robed old man froze, not daring to argue, just nodded glumly!
At that moment, a massive airship drifted into view, Lin Kefan standing at its prow!
Elder Liu and the black-robed old man’s faces turned dead serious!
Spotting Lin Kefan aboard, Elder Liu hurried forward!
“Isn’t this the Fourth Prince of Sun-Moon City? My apologies for not greeting you properly…”
Elder Liu beamed with a toothy grin!
“How much to enter the Lawless Land?” Lin Kefan asked, his face blank!
“For the Fourth Prince to go in, what fees? Just stroll right through.”
Elder Liu said quick!
“I’ve got a few mates on this airship, need to check them?”
Lin Kefan said!
“No need, nothing required.”
Elder Liu waved his hands dismissively.
Lin Kefan grunted, and the airship glided into the grey zone!
“Bloody posh, the Fourth Prince of Sun-Moon City, talk about clout!”
The black-robed old man gawked at the airship slipping away, green with envy!
“Keep your eyes peeled from now on, types like him, if you can avoid crossing them, don’t, guarding this border’s a cushy gig, you’ve got to have some nous.”
Elder Liu lectured the black-robed old man!
“Relax, Elder Liu, these peepers of mine spot a mark a mile off, didn’t I just fleece one?”
The black-robed old man chuckled!
Elder Liu grinned too, chuffed at pocketing a few extra tens of thousands of immortal spirit stones for free!
“You two look pretty pleased with yourselves!”
A voice cut in!
Following the sound, they both froze solid!
“Tenth Hall Master, what brings you here…”
Elder Liu and the black-robed old man rushed to greet him!
The Tenth Hall Master, from the Divine Hall no less, their young masters worked under him!
Sure, the Huo family had bigwigs in the Divine Hall, but these two were from a side branch, mere lackeys, so they fawned over the Tenth Hall Master like eager pups!
“You two manning the border?”
“You two guarding the border?”
The Tenth Hall Master asked!
Thanks to Huo Qing, the Tenth Hall Master was no stranger to the Huo family!
“Yes, yes, we’re on watch,” Elder Liu nodded repeatedly, then added, “Tenth Hall Master’s here, don’t know if the master’s aware, should I report it?”
“No need, I’m just popping by, stretching my legs!”
The Tenth Hall Master waved it off!
“Then please, Tenth Hall Master…”
The two bowed low, gesturing him in!
But right then, a glint of ruthlessness flashed in the Tenth Hall Master’s eyes, followed by a double palm strike!
Boom, boom…
Two thuds, and Elder Liu and the black-robed old man flew back, spitting blood, faces etched with shock!
“Tenth Hall Master, what’s…”
Elder Liu stared in disbelief, unable to fathom why the Tenth Hall Master had suddenly turned on them!
“You blind idiots, daring to scam Mr. Chen’s immortal spirit stones, you’re begging for death!”
The Tenth Hall Master stepped forward, snatching the storage pouches off them, including Chen Ping’s haul.
“Mr. Chen? That kid just now?”
Elder Liu’s face twisted in incredulity.
A mere Third-Grade Mahayana Realm cultivator, dubbed ‘Mr.’ by the Tenth Hall Master, and worth attacking them over!
After pocketing the pouches, the Tenth Hall Master flicked his hand!
Elder Liu and the black-robed old man vanished in an instant, as if they’d never existed!
The Tenth Hall Master swaggered into the grey zone!
Chen Ping, Lin Kefan, and the others were waiting up ahead!
“Got it back?” Chen Ping asked straight off as he saw him!
“Got it!”
The Tenth Hall Master nodded, handing over the pouches!
Chen Ping only took back his own immortal spirit stones, tossing the rest to the Tenth Hall Master!
He’d been so quick to pay earlier not out of reckless wealth, but because he knew he’d reclaim every bit!
