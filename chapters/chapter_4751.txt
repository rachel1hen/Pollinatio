Hearing the old village chief’s shout, the villagers of Dashicun quickly grabbed their stools and ran out, finding a spot to sit down!
Each of them carried melon seeds and snacks, ready to enjoy the spectacle!
“You’re finally here! We’ve been waiting for so long, we thought you weren’t coming!”
“That’s right! This time, you guys from the Demon-Sealing Alliance better last a bit longer. Last time, we didn’t even get to enjoy the show before it was over!”
“Remember to talk some trash! Say whatever you need to say quickly, or you might not even get the chance to speak!”
The villagers shouted at Zuo Tianzheng and his group.
Zuo Tianzheng was completely baffled by the scene before him. He had no idea what the villagers were talking about!
Even more confusing was why these villagers weren’t afraid of him.
He was the leader of the Demon-Sealing Alliance!
“What… what are you all doing? I am the leader of the Demon-Sealing Alliance!”
“Leader, do you understand? The highest authority, the most powerful one in the Demon-Sealing Alliance!”
Zuo Tianzheng roared at the villagers.
“Don’t shout, don’t shout. We get it, we understand. We know you’re the most powerful in the Demon-Sealing Alliance.”
“Just make sure you last a couple of moves this time, don’t embarrass the Demon-Sealing Alliance. Let us enjoy the show!”
The old village chief patted Zuo Tianzheng on the shoulder.
“What are you talking about? What do you mean, last a couple of moves? Does Dashicun have a demonic cultivator? Tell them to come out and face their death!”
Zuo Tianzheng pushed the old village chief away, his face filled with anger.
“Yes, yes, Dashicun has a demonic cultivator!” The old village chief nodded.
“I’ll go call Granny. Granny is the demonic cultivator!”
Yun’er quickly got up and went to fetch the old woman.
Zuo Tianzheng was utterly confused. He couldn’t understand if the people of Dashicun had all gone mad.
“Leader, these villagers… they seem a bit off, don’t they?”
One of the elders beside him also looked puzzled.
“Never mind that. As soon as that demonic cultivator shows up, we strike immediately. Quick and decisive. I have a bad feeling about this place.”
Zuo Tianzheng felt uneasy, as if something was about to happen.
Soon, the old woman was brought out by Yun’er.
Seeing the members of the Demon-Sealing Alliance, the old woman was also excited: “Oh, you’re finally here! I’m the demonic cultivator. Are you here to capture me?”
Zuo Tianzheng scrutinized the old woman and indeed sensed the aura of a demonic cultivator from her. He asked warily, “Since you’re a demonic cultivator and you know we’re here to capture you, why aren’t you running?”
“Why would I run?” The old woman was taken aback, then laughed. “Just make sure you don’t run later!”
“What do you mean?” Zuo Tianzheng asked.
“Leader, why waste words? Let’s just capture her and be done with it. This old woman isn’t strong.”
The elder spoke up, ready to take action against the old woman.
But Zuo Tianzheng stopped him: “Hold on. Something feels off. The more they act like this, the more I feel there’s a problem.”
“Leader, what problem could there be? With their strength, I could crush them with one hand. There’s nothing to worry about!”
The elder spoke with great confidence.
“Let’s test the waters first.” Zuo Tianzheng was being extremely cautious.
Hearing this, the elder turned and pointed at the cultivator who had first entered Dashicun: “You, go capture that demonic cultivator…”
The cultivator was stunned. Though reluctant, he had no choice.
“Damn it…”
This time, the cultivator’s voice was loud enough for the elder to hear.
The elder’s face turned red with anger, but he didn’t react. He would deal with it after capturing the old woman.
The cultivator’s aura swirled around him as he slowly approached the old woman.
With his strength, ten old women wouldn’t be a match for him.
But now, the cultivator was terrified, inching closer to the old woman.
“Are all of you from the Demon-Sealing Alliance this cowardly?”
The old woman mocked the cultivator.
