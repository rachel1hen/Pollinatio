The lead bone dragon’s hollow eye sockets flickered with violently pulsing purple soul fire, it slowly lowered its head, its massive bone claw slightly bending before Chen Ping in a strange gesture of respect.
From the mist sea, the Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord’s hoarse voice carried doubt, “Dao Rune Malevolence… you’re of the beast clan, how could you possibly possess the Yin Demon’s Dao Rune Malevolence?”
Chen Ping struggled to prop himself up, the Dao Rune Malevolence in his body uncontrollably seeping out, forming a ring of black mist around him.
“The Yin Demon’s my good mate, having his Dao Rune Malevolence in me is perfectly normal!” Chen Ping said.
“Rubbish, the Yin Demon vanished years ago, how could he be your mate? You’re just a measly Loose Immortal Realm First Grade!”
“Tell me the truth, or don’t blame me for being merciless!”
The Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord roared, glaring at Chen Ping.
He simply didn’t believe this Chen Ping could be the Yin Demon’s friend.
Even with the golden dragon bloodline, at this level of strength, it was impossible to know the Yin Demon, who had vanished thousands of years ago, rumoured to have perished in the Divine-Demonic War!
The Dragon Lord’s words prompted the bone dragon and skeleton soldiers to inch forward, ready to attack at any moment.
“Take a look at this!” Chen Ping directly produced the God King Bow!
As the God King Bow appeared, the Dao Rune Malevolence in the air instantly began converging towards it!
“The God King Bow?” The Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord’s eyes widened.
But at that moment, several bone dragons were already preparing to attack Chen Ping!
“Stop.”
The Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord spoke hoarsely, his voice tinged with a metallic tremor of fear, “All of you, stop.”
The bone dragons paused, their soul fires flickering, before slowly retreating.
The mist sea churned, and countless skeleton soldiers receded like a tide, actually halting their assault.
Mad Immortal and the others watched, dumbfounded, unable to fathom why the notorious Soul-Devouring Demon Army would retreat at Chen Ping’s word.
“I never imagined you were truly a friend of Senior Yin Demon, my apologies for the offence!” The Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord politely cupped his hands towards Chen Ping, then asked, “Senior Yin Demon vanished for thousands of years, do you know where he is now?”
“The Yin Demon has returned to the Heavenly Realm, I’m planning to visit him for a catch-up soon!”
Chen Ping said.
“So Senior Yin Demon is still alive, truly a miracle!” The Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord sighed.
“You lot came out of nowhere, did you know Rhino City and Flying Tiger City were at war, planning to swoop in for the spoils?” Chen Ping asked.
The Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord nodded, “Indeed, the Hall Master sent me to take advantage of the beast clan’s two cities fighting, to seize their territories for ourselves.”
“Do me a favour, leave Rhino City alone, that’s my brother’s, as for Flying Tiger City, feel free to take it!”
Chen Ping knew that even without the Demon Dragon Hall’s interference, they couldn’t handle Flying Tiger City anyway.
Flying Tiger City had the backing of the Eight Halls, and Rhino City’s strength was nearly depleted, needing time to recover!
“Alright, I won’t hold back then!”
With that, the Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord instantly led the bone dragons and Soul-Devouring Demon Army charging into Flying Tiger City!
Xie Zhong had thought he’d escaped disaster, panting heavily in the main city, celebrating his survival.
But the next moment, over a dozen of Flying Tiger City’s strongholds were simultaneously attacked by the Soul-Devouring Demon Army!
Flying Tiger City’s warriors, already battered from the recent battle and unrested, were no match for the Demon Army, slaughtered without a trace of resistance.
Even the beast clan cultivators in Flying Tiger City faced the same massacre.
Upon receiving the news, Xie Zhong spat out a mouthful of blood, nearly dying on the spot!
With no other choice, he could only beg Huo Zhao for help!
Otherwise, Flying Tiger City would fall into the hands of the demon clan!
