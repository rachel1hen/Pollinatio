“Things that don’t know death!” Chen Ping looked at that Thousand Feet Snake King and could not help but sneer coldly!
A fellow at Earth Immortal realm fifth grade also dared to act presumptuously in front of him.
Chen Ping faced the Thousand Feet Snake King. The Dragon Slaying Sword in his hand was casually swung!
Countless sword beams went towards that Thousand Feet Snake King!
The Thousand Feet Snake King was chopped into several segments. Foul-smelling black blood splashed on the poisonous herbs. Surprisingly, it corroded those plants that lived on poison, causing white smoke to rise.
Snake Elder’s single eye burst with bloodshot veins. His fingers gripping the cloth bag turned white from exertion. “Little beast! You dare to kill my Snake King!”
Snake Elder somewhat could not believe it. Chen Ping, a fellow at Loose Immortal realm ninth grade, had actually killed his carefully nurtured Thousand Feet Snake King!
This Thousand Feet Snake King was Earth Immortal realm fifth grade!
Snake Elder suddenly slapped his chest and spat out a mouthful of light green essence blood. The essence blood fell to the ground.
Those Black Iron Centipedes injured by Hu Mazi’s Corpse Melting Pills surprisingly recovered instantly. Their bodies even doubled in size. Their exoskeletons emitted a strange red light.
“Ten Thousand Poisons Return to One. Tear him apart for me!”
Snake Elder roared while forming seals. The swarm of Black Iron Centipedes, like an army receiving orders, surged overwhelmingly towards Chen Ping.
Hu Mazi’s face turned pale. “These poisonous insects have been catalysed by the essence blood. They’ve already lost reason!”
Mo Chen’s long sword whirled and chopped several Black Iron Centipedes pouncing towards Hu Mazi into powder. “Chen Ping, quick battle, quick decision!”
However, Chen Ping suddenly smiled. It was not panic, but a kind of almost indifferent composure.
He slowly raised the Dragon Slaying Sword. The golden light and baleful energy flowing on the sword body intertwined into a spiral shape, as if alive, swallowing and spitting.
“A group of crawlers also deserve to block the way?”
Before the words fell, his figure suddenly disappeared from the spot.
The next second, a mass of golden and black intermingled light rain exploded in the Black Iron Centipede swarm.
That was not sword light, but the sword intent domain urged by Chen Ping with Loose Immortal realm ninth grade spiritual power.
He had actually fused the sword domain comprehended in the sword tomb with baleful energy and formed a miniature killing field.
Where the light rain passed, the hard exoskeletons of the Black Iron Centipedes shattered like paper. The green juices mixed with black baleful energy and were thoroughly annihilated by the power of the sword domain.
“How is it possible…”
Snake Elder’s pupils contracted sharply. He could feel the life auras of those Black Iron Centipedes disappearing at a terrifying speed, as if swallowed by invisible black holes.
When the last Black Iron Centipede turned into flying ash in the light rain, Chen Ping’s figure had already appeared in front of Snake Elder, no more than three feet away.
“You…”
Snake Elder just wanted to urge his poison technique, but discovered that his body surprisingly could not move.
The baleful energy around Chen Ping had already turned into invisible chains and locked his meridians dead.
“Back then, participating in the encirclement and suppression of the Hu clan, you were also present, right?” Chen Ping’s voice was very light, yet like an ice awl piercing into Snake Elder’s eardrum.
Snake Elder’s complexion changed drastically. “How do you know…”
“I guessed.”
Chen Ping lightly shook his wrist. The Dragon Slaying Sword drew a cold arc under the sunlight. “Keeping you until now is already considered lenient to you.”
“No! I am the enforcement elder of the Ten Thousand Poisons Valley. If you kill me, the valley master won’t let you off…”
The clamouring voice stopped abruptly.
Sword light fell; head flew.
Snake Elder’s head drew an arc in the air. The single eye still retained unbelievable terror. The blood sprayed from the neck just touched the air and was burned into green smoke by the baleful energy around Chen Ping.
The remaining black-robed cultivators, upon seeing this, were scared out of their wits. They turned and wanted to flee.
“Not one is allowed to leave!”
Hu Mazi’s eyes burst with bloodshot veins. He took out three yellow talismans. Muttering incantations, the talismans turned into three fire dragons. Like having eyes, they chased towards the fleeing soldiers.
Mo Chen then flew on his sword shuttling between the poisonous herbs. The long sword lightly tapped. Each tremor caused a black-robed cultivator to clutch his throat and fall. The sword did not stain with the slightest blood. His sword energy had already strangled the toxins and vitality together.
