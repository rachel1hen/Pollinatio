“Watch out!”
Chen Ping shoved Hu Mazi aside, taking the claw strike himself.
With a “pfft,” blood instantly soaked the clothes on his back, black malign energy seeping into his flesh from five deep, bone-revealing wounds.
“Chen Ping!”
Hu Mazi’s eyes widened in fury. His hands swiftly formed seals, dozens of talisman papers dancing before him: some turned into earthen walls, others into ice spikes, and some into vines, momentarily holding back the Sixth Hall Master and the Golden Armoured Guards.
But he was only at the First Grade of the Earth Immortal Realm, his reincarnated strength not yet fully restored. His spiritual energy drained rapidly, and soon he was gasping, beads of sweat dripping from his forehead.
The Sixth Hall Master sneered, his claw shadows accelerating. In an instant, he tore through the vines and struck Hu Mazi’s chest with a claw.
Hu Mazi, as if hit by a heavy blow, spat out blood and crashed beside Chen Ping, his talismans scattering across the ground.
“Now, who can save you?”
The Sixth Hall Master approached step by step, his Eighth-Grade Earth Immortal Realm pressure flooding over them like a tide, making it nearly impossible for Chen Ping and Hu Mazi to breathe.
At this critical moment, a rough shout came from the street’s entrance: “What scum dares harm my benefactor!”
Nan Batian appeared, wielding a black iron heavy axe, charging forward on a flying axe, its blade wrapped in crimson spiritual energy.
Following closely was A Cui, holding a dagger inlaid with a sapphire, its faint runes glowing, a “Law-Breaking Dagger” crafted by the Information Building, designed to pierce cultivators’ protective spiritual energy.
“Nan Batian!” Hu Mazi exclaimed, both shocked and delighted, struggling to rise.
“I am the Sixth Hall Master of the Divine Hall. Unrelated parties, get lost, or don’t blame me for being ruthless,” the Sixth Hall Master threatened, wary of Nan Batian and A Cui’s arrival interrupting his plan to kill Chen Ping.
“Sixth Hall Master, my arse! Dare touch Mr. Chen, and even the King of Heaven won’t save you!” Nan Batian roared, swinging his heavy axe with immense force, the axe wind sending shattered stones flying.
“You Divine Hall tyrants run rampant in the Fifth Heaven. Do you think us rogue cultivators are easy to bully?”
With his heart unburdened, his spiritual energy flowed smoother than ever. Though only at the peak of Seventh-Grade Earth Immortal Realm, his fierce courage faintly unleashed Eighth-Grade strength.
“Hmph, a Seventh-Grade Earth Immortal trash dares meddle in Divine Hall affairs?”
The Sixth Hall Master sneered. As his God-Locking Claw clashed with the heavy axe, he twisted sharply, the claw tip sliding along the axe’s edge, aiming for Nan Batian’s wrist.
The move was swift and ruthless. Nan Batian, caught off guard, could only dodge sideways, the claw grazing his arm, drawing a string of blood beads.
“Brother Batian!”
A Cui let out a sharp cry, her Law-Breaking Dagger flashing blue as it struck precisely at the Sixth Hall Master’s ribs.
Though her cultivation had dropped to Fifth-Grade Earth Immortal Realm, her movements were agile, and the dagger’s law-breaking runes repeatedly tore through the Sixth Hall Master’s protective spiritual energy, giving Nan Batian moments to recover.
In an instant, a fierce battle erupted on the street.
Nan Batian’s heavy axe swung with wide, powerful strokes, shielding Chen Ping and Hu Mazi.
A Cui’s dagger darted unpredictably, exploiting the Sixth Hall Master’s weaknesses.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi seized the chance to regulate their breathing, occasionally launching sneak attacks.
But the Sixth Hall Master’s strength was overwhelming. His Eighth-Grade Earth Immortal Realm spiritual energy was like a vast ocean, his God-Locking Claw alternating between thunderous force and venomous subtlety, gradually gaining the upper hand.
“Clang!”
Nan Batian’s heavy axe was struck by a claw shadow, a notch appearing on its blade. He grunted, forced back several steps, his chest stained with blood.
A Cui rushed to protect him but was caught off guard. The Sixth Hall Master’s kick landed on her abdomen, sending her stumbling into Nan Batian’s arms.
“Two pieces of trash dare block this Hall Master’s path?”
With a sinister grin, the Sixth Hall Master turned and lunged at Chen Ping again: “Today, I’ll show you the price of defying the Divine Hall!”
