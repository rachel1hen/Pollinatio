Chen Ping was not some kind of saint. In this world, there was no good or bad; there were only enemies and friends.
Enemies could only die.
Li Chunfeng understood Chen Ping’s meaning. Without any nonsense, he waved his hand and sent out several sword qi.
Those disciples of the Holy Light Sect let out miserable screams and were all instantly slain.
After dealing with the Holy Light Sect matter, Li Chunfeng looked at Chen Ping: “Mr. Chen, it is not advisable to stay here long. Let us return to Sword Saint City first.”
Chen Ping nodded. He now had too many questions he wanted to ask Li Chunfeng.
Li Chunfeng gently waved his hand; a soft force lifted Chen Ping, Hu Mazi, and Mo Chen. Then it turned into a stream of light, flying towards the direction of Sword Saint City.
Behind them, the once glorious Holy Light Sect gradually lost its former splendour in the afterglow of the setting sun, leaving only ruins that told of what had once happened here.
Chen Ping looked back and felt a thousand emotions in his heart.
From the Ten Thousand Poisons Valley to the Holy Light Sect, this journey had been fraught with dangers. If not for the assistance of Mo Chen and Hu Mazi, if not for Li Chunfeng’s timely appearance, he would probably have perished long ago.
“That damned Red Cloud Demon Lord, why has there been no movement at all?”
Chen Ping cursed the Red Cloud Demon Lord in his heart.
If the Red Cloud Demon Lord had possessed him in time, he would not have almost died.
The outline of Sword Saint City gradually became clear in the twilight; the stream of light transformed by Li Chunfeng slowly descended above the Sword Sect’s residence.
This courtyard located in the east of the city was not luxurious, yet it exuded a sense of peace under the setting sun, forming a stark contrast with the bloody storms they had experienced before.
“Mr. Chen, Fellow Daoist Mo, Master Hu, please rest here for now.” Li Chunfeng waved his hand to remove the protective shield; the gentle spiritual power supported the three of them to land steadily. “I have already instructed the servants to prepare healing pills. If there is any need, just send a message.”
Chen Ping struggled to stand straight; bursts of stinging pain came from his left arm, but the disordered spiritual power in his body had been sorted out a bit by Li Chunfeng’s sword qi.
“Thank you, City Lord Li, for your assistance.” Hu Mazi and Mo Chen both thanked him.
“You are too polite.” Li Chunfeng nodded slightly. “You all recuperate first. If there is anything, Mr. Chen can call me at any time.”
After saying that, Li Chunfeng disappeared instantly.
After settling Hu Mazi and Mo Chen, Chen Ping sat alone on the stone bench in the courtyard.
Moonlight sprinkled mottled shadows through the wutong leaves. He slowly circulated the Heart Condensing Art; golden spiritual power flowed arduously through his meridians. Every inch of damaged channels repaired felt like countless fine needles piercing.
“Hiss…”
Chen Ping drew in a sharp breath; the wound on his chest seeped blood again due to the surge of spiritual power.
He untied his clothes; on the charred mark scorched by Wang Shengguang’s palm wind, threads of evil qi and dragon essence were tearing at each other, as if competing for control of the body.
“This holy light power is quite stubborn.”
Chen Ping frowned slightly and took out a vermilion pill from his storage ring.
As soon as the pill entered his mouth, it turned into a cool medicinal liquid that flowed through his limbs and bones; the burning sensation was immediately alleviated a lot.
From afar came Mo Chen’s coughing sound. Chen Ping looked in that direction and saw the old sect master being supported by disciples, standing under the corridor. His pale face carried the relief of surviving a disaster: “Chen Ping, are you alright?”
“I am fine, Master. I will not die.”
Chen Ping grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth. “It is you and Master Hu who need to rest well.”
Mo Chen waved his hand and walked closer, saying in a low voice: “City Lord Li… truly recognises you as his master?”
Recalling that shocking scene at the Holy Light Sect, he still felt it unbelievable.
The lord of Sword Saint City, at the peak of the ninth grade of the Earth Immortal Realm, actually performed such a great courtesy to a disciple in the Loose Immortal Realm. If this spread out, it would probably shock the jaws of all cultivators in the Fifth Heaven.
Chen Ping smiled bitterly: “We had a chance encounter on the Heaven-Ascending Ladder. It cannot be considered a master-servant relationship; perhaps he has an eccentric temperament.”
Chen Ping was unwilling to mention too much about his connection with Li Chunfeng. Some secrets were better known by fewer people.
