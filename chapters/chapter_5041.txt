Chen Ping let out a long breath and said gravely, “We’ve likely been pulled into an ancient ruin… This is probably the true secret of the Floating Island.”
Mo Qingyun swallowed hard, “Then… can we get out?”
Mo Qingyun was scared. If they couldn’t escape, they’d be in serious trouble. The eerie atmosphere made her even more frightened.
Chen Ping didn’t answer, instead looking toward the depths of the ruin, where a low, rumbling sound echoed, as if something was awakening…
Suddenly, a white light flashed, startling Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun.
As the light dissipated, a man in green robes slowly appeared. He stood three metres tall, a large blade strapped to his back, exuding a powerful aura.
Upon appearing, the man’s gaze fell on Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun, and he froze in disbelief.
“How did you two get here with such low cultivation levels?”
The green-robed man asked, puzzled.
Chen Ping sized him up, noting that the man was at the fifth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, which confused him.
By all accounts, someone at the fifth rank of the Loose Immortal Realm wouldn’t stay in the First Heaven, where such experts were rare.
Yet this green-robed man was undeniably at that level.
No wonder he remarked on their low cultivation—Chen Ping was only at the first rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, and Mo Qingyun was at the third.
“Friend, does a low cultivation level mean we can’t come here?” Chen Ping asked.
“Not exactly. I’m just curious how a first-rank Loose Immortal like you reached the Second Heaven,” the green-robed man asked curiously.
“Second Heaven?” Chen Ping was stunned, “I didn’t go to the Second Heaven. I’m in the First Heaven…”
“Impossible. The entrance to this ruin is in the Tianxuan Cave Mansion of the Second Heaven. How could someone from the First Heaven get here?”
The green-robed man didn’t believe Chen Ping at all.
Chen Ping was equally confused and about to explain when the void ahead trembled!
A white-robed man emerged from the air.
Holding a folding fan, the white-robed man radiated a powerful aura, causing the surrounding void to quiver.
Chen Ping noticed that this man’s cultivation was no weaker than the green-robed man’s.
The moment the white-robed man appeared, the green-robed man’s brows furrowed, and he cursed, “Damn it, you just won’t quit…”
With that, the green-robed man drew the large blade from his back and slashed at the white-robed man.
The strike unleashed a blade aura stretching thousands of metres, sending terrifying shockwaves rippling through the void.
Seeing this, Chen Ping grabbed Mo Qingyun’s hand and retreated to avoid being caught in the shockwaves.
Though he didn’t understand why the two men started fighting on sight, Chen Ping had no connection to them and didn’t want to get involved.
Mo Qingyun’s hand was soft and smooth, delicate as if boneless, in Chen Ping’s grip.
Chen Ping didn’t react, but Mo Qingyun glanced at him, her face flushing red.
It was the first time a man had held her hand.
And it was a man she secretly admired.
Chen Ping didn’t notice her reaction, gripping his Dragon-Slaying Sword and unleashing sword intents to block the relentless waves of shockwaves.
Mo Qingyun stood behind him, watching as Chen Ping tirelessly shielded her from the impacts.
In that moment, Chen Ping’s figure grew even taller in her eyes.
Unconsciously, Mo Qingyun leaned her head on his shoulder.
Chen Ping sensed something but only glanced at her, saying nothing. The two men were fighting fiercely, and the surrounding void seemed on the verge of collapsing.
Chen Ping had to focus on blocking the shockwaves, or while the two men fought unscathed, he and Mo Qingyun would suffer.
