Huo Zhenfeng stowed away the storage pouch, then took out a Huo Family token. Forcing out a drop of essence blood, he let it drip onto the token!
Boom!
A beam of light shot skyward from the Huo Family token!
In an instant, a terrifying aura of authority swept across the heavens and earth, and everyone present felt the overwhelming pressure!
All eyes turned towards the direction of the light beam!
At that moment, Chen Ping was in the midst of his tribulation, with bolts of lightning roiling through the clouds!
Lin Chong, Wuji Daoist, and the others all furrowed their brows!
“Does that Ming Shao have more allies behind him?”
Tension gripped everyone’s hearts!
The nether corpses alone were already a handful to deal with. If the enemy brought in more experts, how could they possibly fight back?
As the oppressive aura drew closer, a middle-aged man in a green robe slowly appeared. He was thin and frail, hardly looking like a powerhouse!
Moreover, it was clear this wasn’t his true body, and his aura made it impossible to discern his cultivation level!
Even Ming Shao, facing this newcomer, was momentarily taken aback, reining in his usual arrogance a bit!
“What’s the matter?” the middle-aged man asked, looking at Huo Zhenfeng.
“Ancestor, the Huo Family is in grave danger,” Huo Zhenfeng replied.
But the middle-aged man waved his hand dismissively. “Don’t call me that. I’m not the Huo Family ancestor. With this Huo Family token, you can only summon someone like me to assist you.”
Clearly, this man wasn’t the Huo Family ancestor, and he didn’t seem to hold a particularly high status within the family either!
Huo Zhenfeng froze, at a loss for words. After all, ever since he became the Huo Family head, this token had been passed down with the claim that it could summon the Huo Family ancestor in times of dire need!
Seeing Huo Zhenfeng’s confusion, the middle-aged man explained, “My name is Huo Zhao, an elder of the Huo Family. You’re just a collateral branch—did you really think you could summon the ancestor? That’s a joke.”
Huo Zhenfeng’s face flushed with embarrassment. They were indeed a collateral branch. The main Huo Family line, after all, had many members serving in the Divine Temple!
One could only imagine how powerful the main family was!
Even this elder, appearing as a mere projection rather than in person, likely outmatched everyone present in strength!
“Elder Huo, the Huo Family in the Celestial Realm is facing a catastrophic crisis. Please lend us your aid,” Huo Zhenfeng pleaded.
Huo Zhao scanned the scene, his gaze lingering on the thunder tribulation in the sky, his expression growing solemn.
“A Celestial Realm cultivator capable of triggering such a tribulation?” Huo Zhao muttered, his brows furrowing.
“Elder Huo, it’s that kid over there causing the tribulation. He’s crossing it right now…” Huo Zhenfeng pointed at Chen Ping.
Even without the explanation, Huo Zhao could tell—after all, he wasn’t blind. He could see the lightning bolts striking Chen Ping!
“A mere Great Ascension Realm cultivator drawing such a terrifying tribulation? This boy is no ordinary person. And it seems he carries the bloodline aura of three clans.”
“Why would you provoke someone like this? Are you asking for trouble?” Huo Zhao shot Huo Zhenfeng a displeased look.
“Senior, this Chen Ping is my enemy. I’m the one who wants him dead, and the Huo Family head is assisting me!” Ming Shao interjected.
“And who are you?” Huo Zhao asked.
“Four Nether Prefectures, Ming Shao!” Ming Shao declared with his usual swagger.
“Four Nether Prefectures? Never heard of it!” Huo Zhao shook his head, then turned back to Huo Zhenfeng. “You used the Huo Family token to help someone else? You collateral branches only get one token each, meant for life-or-death crises. How could you use it so recklessly?”
Huo Zhao was visibly annoyed that Huo Zhenfeng had summoned him just to aid an outsider!
“Elder Huo, the Four Nether Prefectures are a powerful force in the Celestial Realm with abundant resources. They just gave us 500,000 immortal spirit stones.”
“This Wuwang Land is utterly barren, devoid of resources. If the Huo Family wants to grow, we have no choice but to ally with others!” Huo Zhenfeng hurriedly explained.
Huo Zhao let out a cold snort. “Has the Huo Family’s collateral branch fallen so low that you must rely on others to survive?”
“Fine, since you’ve summoned me, I’ll help you this once. But if you face danger again in the future, no one will come to your aid!”
