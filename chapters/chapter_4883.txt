The Heaven and Earth Array was collapsing, and from every corner of the Celestial Realm, beams of golden light shot into the sky, these were the Heavenly Realm cultivators trapped within!
These golden beams filled the entire Celestial Realm like fireworks, Chen Ping gazed at them, astonished that so many Heavenly Realm cultivators had been confined here!
In a certain cave, the Ancestor of Divine Patterns and Zhen Mo were still playing chess, both sensing the disappearance of the Heaven and Earth Array, their faces lit up with long-lost smiles!
“Senior Brother, this game has gone on for so many years, now it’s time to decide the winner and go home!”
Zhen Mo said with a laugh!
“Home, trapped here for all these years, I thought I’d never make it back in this lifetime!”
The Ancestor of Divine Patterns replied, gently placing a chess piece down!
Zhen Mo froze, then looked at him in shock, “Senior Brother, you… how did you beat me so fast? Then why did this game drag on for years?”
“If I hadn’t kept you company with this game all these years, with your competitive streak, you’d have probably died of frustration long ago!”
The Ancestor of Divine Patterns smiled!
Hearing this, Zhen Mo chuckled too, “Senior Brother, thank you…”
With that, two golden flashes lit up, and the cave emptied, leaving only the chessboard behind!
Perhaps many years later, this cave would become a fabled immortal abode sought by future cultivators!
The Heavenly Realm cultivators raced back to their realm, not daring to linger for even a second!
Wuji Daoist, Nan Batian, Li Chunfeng, Shen Zhiyan…
They stared at the crumbling Heaven and Earth Array, their eyes filled with longing!
But they knew they couldn’t leave yet, if they did, Chen Ping would surely die!
Against Wen Nanxing’s strength, even all of them together couldn’t hold out, if Chen Ping were left alone, he’d be crushed to dust in an instant!
“Mr. Chen, hurry and escape, we can’t hold on much longer!”
Lin Chong called out to Chen Ping!
That terrifying aura had already pinned them down, now that the Heaven and Earth Array was broken, if Chen Ping didn’t flee soon, he’d certainly face Wen Nanxing’s wrath!
“Don’t worry, not one of you will escape…”
Wen Nanxing’s face twisted with ferocity!
The Ancestor had ordered him to stop Chen Ping from breaking the array, and now that he’d failed, he knew if he didn’t kill them all, he’d have no face to return to the Ancestor!
And if the Ancestor held him accountable, not only he but the entire Fire Incineration Sect might vanish!
As Wen Nanxing’s aura erupted once more, Chen Ping’s body felt crushed under the weight of ten thousand mountains!
“Mr. Chen, this is as far as I can help you!”
Seeing Chen Ping suppressed too, Lin Chong’s eyes flashed with resolve!
With that, he clenched his fists, his body starting to swell!
Lin Chong was about to self-destruct!
Chen Ping, seeing this, shouted urgently, “Emperor Lin, no…”
“Mr. Shi…”
Chen Ping roared, calling for Mr. Shi!
He didn’t know if Mr. Shi could hear him, but he knew that in his most dire moments, Mr. Shi would always appear!
“Mr. Shi?” Wen Nanxing sneered coldly, “Even calling your father won’t help you now!”
Chen Ping ignored him, shouting again, “Mr. Shi…”
Boom!
Just as Chen Ping finished, the sky split open as if torn in two, and a middle-aged man in a green robe stepped out slowly!
“Mr. Shi…” Seeing him, Chen Ping’s face lit up with joy!
The moment Mr. Shi arrived, that terrifying pressure of heaven and earth vanished instantly!
Everyone let out a long breath of relief!
The Western Domain Lord saw Mr. Shi, his body trembling slightly, “It’s him, it’s him…”
The Western Domain Lord’s pants were wet, he’d peed himself again!
Wen Nanxing sized up Mr. Shi, sneering, “Who are you? Daring to interfere with the Fire Incineration Sect’s affairs?”
