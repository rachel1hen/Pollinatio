A single slash unleashed a blood-red thunderbolt that swept across the sky, instantly reducing a Temple expert to charred remains!
The other warrior statue brandished a white longsword, blue flames transforming into a giant dragon that devoured another Temple expert.
“What… what are these monsters?!” Huo Zhao cried out in horror.
The people brought by the Inspector were far stronger than those of the Eight Halls.
Yet now, they were being slaughtered by the two warriors Chen Ping had summoned, utterly powerless to resist.
The Inspector’s face changed drastically, “Ancient war puppets? Impossible! How can you control them?”
Chen Ping didn’t bother to respond, his figure flashing like lightning, charging straight at the Inspector!
“Courting death!” the Inspector roared, his bone whip arcing like a rainbow towards Chen Ping.
Facing the bone whip, Chen Ping’s eyes blazed with cold light. Instead of retreating, he advanced, rushing head-on towards the whip!
“Seeking death!”
The Inspector grinned ferociously, his bone whip suddenly expanding several times in size, transforming into a menacing bone dragon that lunged at Chen Ping with its gaping maw!
“Chen Ping, be careful!”
Huo Jingjing cried out, her face pale.
Just as the bone dragon was about to swallow Chen Ping, a dazzling golden light erupted from his body!
A dragon’s roar echoed through the sky, golden scales appearing around Chen Ping, his right hand transforming into a dragon claw that fiercely grabbed at the bone dragon!
Ever since Chen Ping had transformed into a golden dragon, he had mastered the ability to shift forms.
“Crack!”
With a teeth-grinding sound of shattering, the seemingly indestructible bone dragon was crushed by Chen Ping’s bare hands!
“What?”
The Inspector’s pupils contracted sharply. Before he could react, Chen Ping appeared before him like a phantom!
“Old fool, my turn!”
Chen Ping’s right fist gathered terrifying golden thunder, striking directly at the Inspector’s face!
“Boom!”
In an earth-shaking explosion, the Inspector was sent flying, his mask shattering to reveal a scarred, grotesque face.
“Ah! My face!”
The Inspector let out a piercing scream, blood gushing from his orifices.
Meanwhile, the two warrior statues began their massacre!
The black warrior’s giant blade swept across, blood-red thunder forming a vast electric net that instantly enveloped over a dozen Temple experts!
“Ah…”
Screams rose and fell as the Temple experts convulsed wildly in the electric net, turning to ash in moments!
The white warrior was even more terrifying. Each swing of its longsword unleashed a sea of blue flames, warping the very space it passed through!
“What are these monsters?”
A Temple expert retreated in terror, only to be cleaved in two by the white warrior, his body reduced to ashes by the blue flames before it even hit the ground!
“Form the array! Quick, form the array!” a Temple expert screamed.
But before they could complete the formation, the black warrior let out a sky-shaking roar, plunging its giant blade into the ground!
“Rumble…”
The earth trembled violently, countless blood-red thunderbolts erupting from the ground, instantly blasting dozens of Temple experts to pieces!
“Too strong…”
Hu Mazi stared in stunned disbelief, forgetting to activate the talisman in his hand.
Huo Jingjing’s eyes sparkled with awe, murmuring, “Chen Ping can control such powerful war puppets…”
Lan Lianhua’s expression was grave, “These two warriors, their origins must be extraordinary…”
Only Mo Qingyun knew the origin of the two ancient warriors, so she wasn’t surprised.
Tens of thousands of years ago, a sect capable of creating a world in the heavens left behind two guardian warriors, their strength undoubtedly formidable.
In the centre of the battlefield, Chen Ping’s fight with the Inspector had reached a fever pitch.
Huo Zhao watched in a daze, completely dumbfounded.
“Father, should we help?” Huo Shizi whispered to Huo Zhao!
“Help your mother! Can’t you see the Inspector wants to kill your sister?”
“Maybe Chen Ping can kill him, and that way your sister will be safe.”
Huo Zhao glared at Huo Shizi and said!
