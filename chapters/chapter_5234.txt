Nan Batian was momentarily stunned, then burst into hearty laughter, “Fine! Since Mr. Chen is in such high spirits, I’ll just watch from the side! But if this old fool dares to play dirty, I’ll crush his skull in an instant!”
Hearing this, You Wuji trembled with rage.
A mere Loose Immortal junior dared to treat him as a practice target?
What an utter humiliation! He roared, his claw shadows speeding up by a fraction, slicing through the air with a sharp whistle towards Chen Ping.
Chen Ping, however, remained calm, his feet tracing mysterious steps, his figure weaving through the claw shadows like a phantom.
He didn’t rush to attack, instead dodging continuously while closely observing You Wuji’s force and the flow of his aura.
“The aura of a fifth-rank Earth Immortal is indeed robust, but there are plenty of flaws in its flow…”
Chen Ping noted to himself, suddenly swaying his body to narrowly dodge a claw shadow. With a flick of his wrist, the Demon-Whipping Lash shot out like a viper, crackling with golden arcs of electricity towards You Wuji’s wrist.
“Crack!”
The Demon-Whipping Lash struck precisely, and You Wuji felt a surge of pure, righteous energy flood into his arm, instantly shattering the condensed black fiend demonic energy, a burning pain shooting through his wrist.
At the same time, his divine consciousness faltered, though faintly, he still felt it!
“This whip…”
You Wuji was both shocked and furious, not expecting his opponent to wield a treasure so effective against demonic cultivators.
“Old fool, how’s that taste?”
Chen Ping sneered, his footwork quickening, at times flowing like a gentle breeze, at others striking like sudden thunder, executing the Fire-Control Step.
Paired with the long-range attacks of the Demon-Whipping Lash, he was like an agile hunter, constantly harassing You Wuji.
Despite You Wuji’s fifth-rank Earth Immortal cultivation, he couldn’t land a solid hit on Chen Ping, instead getting struck several times by the Demon-Whipping Lash, his black robe torn in several places, revealing the withered skin beneath.
“You little bastard, stop dodging if you’ve got the guts! If I don’t kill you today, I, You Wuji, will be a laughingstock!”
You Wuji roared, his hands forming seals, the black mist around him condensing into a massive black spear, “Taste my Black Fiend Demon Spear!”
The black spear, carrying a heaven-destroying aura, thrust straight at Chen Ping.
This strike concentrated seventy percent of his power, its speed so great that Chen Ping had no time to dodge.
“Here it comes!”
A glint of ferocity flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes. Instead of retreating, he charged towards the spear.
The dragon power within him surged wildly, golden light forming a layer of golden scale armor around his body.
“Indestructible Golden Body!”
“Boom!”
The black spear collided with the golden shield, producing a deafening roar.
The golden shield trembled violently, countless cracks appearing, but it ultimately withstood the blow.
Chen Ping was forced back by the immense impact, blood trickling from his mouth again, but his gaze grew sharper.
“He actually blocked my Black Fiend Demon Spear?” You Wuji was utterly shocked.
He couldn’t fathom how a seventh-rank Loose Immortal could withstand his full-force strike.
“Old fool, warm-up’s over!”
Chen Ping wiped the blood from his mouth, a manic grin spreading across his face, “Now, let me show you my combo!”
Before his words faded, he vanished from the spot.
“Nine Shadows Sword Technique!”
Several identical figures of Chen Ping appeared in the hall, each wielding the Dragon-Slaying Sword, slashing towards You Wuji.
You Wuji’s pupils contracted, instinctively swinging his black fiend demonic energy to defend.
But the figures were a mix of real and illusory, some dissipating under the demonic energy, while others landed solid cuts on his body.
“Pfft!”
One figure’s Dragon-Slaying Sword sliced through You Wuji’s arm, drawing a stream of black blood.
“Petty tricks!” You Wuji roared, unleashing a burst of aura that shattered all the figures.
