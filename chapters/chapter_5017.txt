“Young Miss…” The purple-robed elder was shocked!
“Elder Lei, with my current condition, I’m afraid I won’t be able to return anytime soon!”
Mo Qingyun said, her expression pained.
Seeing this, the purple-robed elder sighed, “You used the Demon-Breaking Holy Light, destroyed the Mo family spear, and now you’re injured and can’t return, how am I to explain this to the Patriarch?”
“Elder Lei, go back and keep my father calm, I’ll return after recovering for a few days!”
Mo Qingyun said.
“Miss Mo, your injury was for our sake, we’ll cover all healing resources and needs until you’re fully recovered, and I’ll take full responsibility for your safety!”
Chen Ping, seeing Mo Qingyun’s state, felt deeply guilty.
“Elder Lei, with Friend Chen saying this, you can return with peace of mind!”
Mo Qingyun said to the purple-robed elder.
The elder hesitated, then nodded, “Alright, Young Miss, you must be careful!”
With that, he waved his hand, a bolt of lightning tore through the void, the space trembled, and his figure was swallowed by darkness, vanishing instantly!
“Let’s head back…”
Chen Ping led the group, dragging their exhausted bodies back to Rhino City!
As for Huo Shizi, Chen Ping didn’t release him, he planned to use him to keep Huo Zhao in check!
Otherwise, if he let Huo Shizi go now, Huo Zhao might attack tomorrow!
In their current state, how could they resist?
Back in Rhino City, Chen Ping’s first task was to tend to Xiu Rui’s body.
As for Nuo Qing, she had self-detonated, reduced to ashes, leaving no body behind!
Though he hadn’t known Xiu Rui long, Chen Ping always saw him as a brother!
Hu Mazi was also visibly saddened, having grown to respect Xiu Rui during their time together.
“Brother, rest in peace, I’ll avenge you, I’ll wipe out everyone in the Eight Halls.”
Chen Ping looked at Xiu Rui’s body, his eyes cold.
“Alright, it’s fate, don’t blame yourself!”
Hu Mazi patted Chen Ping’s shoulder.
Moments later, they buried Xiu Rui’s body, for Nuo Qing, Xiu Rui was fortunate, at least his body could be laid to rest.
He even had a chance for reincarnation, to live again!
But after self-detonation, it was truly utter annihilation, with no possibility of rebirth.
So some, even in death, would never choose to self-detonate.
“Go check on your father-in-law, he’s probably struggling too!”
Hu Mazi said.
Chen Ping nodded and went to see Bai Yi, who, after this battle, was noticeably weakened, and Nuo Qing’s death had hit him hard!
Seeing Chen Ping, Bai Yi forced a smile, “Son-in-law, I’m fine, I’ve lived so long, I’ve long made peace with life and death.”
“Don’t worry about me, let me have a few quiet days to rest!”
Chen Ping nodded, said nothing, and turned to leave!
As he left, Bai Yi’s cries echoed from the room, though Nuo Qing was a subordinate, she was fiercely loyal and had self-detonated to save him, Bai Yi was heartbroken!
Chen Ping left and found Mo Qingyun.
Mo Qingyun was in poor condition, her face pale, but she managed a faint smile upon seeing Chen Ping!
“Miss Mo, I’ll take you somewhere that’ll help with your recovery!”
Chen Ping said to Mo Qingyun.
“Where?” Mo Qingyun asked, puzzled.
“You’ll see when we get there!” Chen Ping said, stepping forward to take Mo Qingyun’s hand, then directly entering the Demon-Suppressing Tower!
When Mo Qingyun arrived in the tower, she was stunned!
The Demon-Suppressing Tower was filled with countless immortal stones!
The immortal energy inside was a thousand times denser than outside!
