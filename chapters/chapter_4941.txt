“No worries, to others, these malevolent spirits are terrifying, but to me, they’re top-notch resources!”
Chen Ping gave a slight smile.
These spirits could be refined and absorbed, and the sinister energy within them was far denser than the ambient energy in the environment.
“Freak…”
The Crimson Cloud Demon Lord rolled his eyes and paid him no further mind.
Soon, as the surrounding sinister energy continued to pour into Chen Ping’s body, countless malevolent spirits surged towards him!
Jie jie jie…
The spirits let out terrifying cackles. To them, Chen Ping was the perfect resource.
If they absorbed enough vital energy, they could slowly regenerate their physical forms.
Thus, everyone who entered the purgatory became a target for these spirits.
But Chen Ping was the weakest in cultivation among those who entered, making him an even more appealing target for the spirits.
Who wouldn’t prefer a weaker opponent?
Just as the spirits thought Chen Ping was an easy mark to toy with, his eyes suddenly snapped open.
His eyes had turned a vivid scarlet, the pupils gone, replaced by a sea of blood.
“Ah…”
Chen Ping opened his mouth and let out a ferocious roar!
Boom!
A terrifying aura erupted from his body. The surrounding spirits had no time to dodge or flee, instantly swallowed by the aura, transforming into streams of pure sinister energy.
In that moment, the spirits’ souls were obliterated, with no chance of ever returning.
Chen Ping now seemed to have entered a frenzied state, recklessly absorbing the surrounding sinister energy.
The spirits rushing towards him were all devoured by the aura bursting from his body, then converted into pure sinister energy for him to absorb.
This cycle repeated, and Chen Ping felt utterly exhilarated. Here, he had no need to hold back.
In the outside world, whether in the mortal realm, the celestial realm, or the heavenly realm, Chen Ping always felt some hesitation and moral conflict when using the Heart Condensation Technique to devour others.
But here, he had no such qualms. He could absorb these malevolent spirits without a care, unconcerned about who they might have been in life.
Chen Ping slowly walked forward, with countless spirits charging at him relentlessly. Even if they were instantly crushed by his aura, more kept coming.
These spirits were like mindless insects, flinging themselves into a fire, knowing death awaited yet still rushing forward.
Chen Ping, meanwhile, kept channeling the Heart Condensation Technique, heading deeper into the purgatory, absorbing every bit of sinister energy around him without wasting a drop!
At that moment, in the city lord’s mansion, Niu Mang furrowed his brow, staring at a bronze mirror.
The mirror displayed the scene of Chen Ping in the purgatory.
“Who is this guy?” Niu Mang was visibly shocked, as many trial participants didn’t handle the purgatory as effortlessly as Chen Ping.
Chen Ping was strolling through it like it was his own back garden, even absorbing the sinister energy.
“Could he be a demon?” Niu Mang’s eyes widened.
Although cultivators from other cities came to Rhino City’s purgatory for trials, they were all from beast clan territories, all of the same kind.
Never before had a cultivator from another race come to trial. Now, seeing Chen Ping absorb the sinister energy, Niu Mang couldn’t help but suspect he was a demon.
“Someone, fetch the records of everyone who entered the purgatory today, now!”
Niu Mang commanded loudly.
Immediately, someone went to retrieve Chen Ping’s information.
Meanwhile, in the purgatory, Chen Ping remained oblivious, still gleefully absorbing the sinister energy.
He had originally intended to train and hone his combat skills, but now it was just a one-sided slaughter, offering no growth in experience. Still, he could absorb plenty of sinister energy, and his cultivation level was likely to rise again.
