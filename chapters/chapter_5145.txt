Hu Mazi and the others didn’t need to do anything, just wait!
“Chen Ping, your show-off skills are getting smoother. Can you let me take the stage at Blood Shadow Palace?”
Hu Mazi said to Chen Ping!
Chen Ping looked at Hu Mazi with a smile, “Master Hu, do you happen to know that Blood Shadow Palace is full of female cultivators?”
“I don’t know anything, I just want to show off a bit!” Hu Mazi quickly shook his head!
“I can let you have it, but since they’re all female cultivators, I’m worried you won’t have the heart to strike!” Chen Ping said!
“Don’t worry, what woman can’t I handle? I can have my fun first, then kill. Otherwise, killing them without enjoying them would be such a waste!”
Hu Mazi grinned!
As a sect with ten thousand years of history, Tianyan Sect had an incredibly deep foundation.
The group soon found the sect’s treasury within the mountain’s core.
The treasury’s gate, forged from ten-thousand-year-old black iron and layered with restrictions, shattered like glass under Chen Ping’s casual wave.
Pushing open the heavy gate, everyone was stunned by the sight before them.
The treasury was filled with mountains of immortal stones, countless top-grade and supreme-grade stones glimmering brightly.
The walls were lined with all sorts of treasures: flying swords, armours, formation discs, talismans, everything one could imagine.
Neatly arranged jade boxes held rare immortal herbs, elixirs, and even a few ten-thousand-year-old spiritual herbs on the verge of taking form.
“My goodness… how many resources are there!”
Hu Mazi swallowed hard, his eyes wide.
Huo Jingjing and Mo Qingyun were equally shocked; despite their prestigious backgrounds, they had never seen such a vast amount of resources.
Chen Ping stepped into the treasury, his gaze sweeping over the treasures without much reaction.
To him, while these resources were valuable, the priority was boosting his strength.
With a wave of his hand, the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda opened, absorbing the treasury’s resources in a steady stream.
Immortal stones, elixirs, herbs… everything in sight was packed away by Chen Ping.
In mere moments, the once treasure-filled treasury was left bare, with only polished stone walls remaining.
However, Chen Ping didn’t keep everything for himself, distributing some treasures and weapons to Qingyun Sect.
These items were of little use to him and wouldn’t enhance his strength; his own treasures far surpassed them.
A small gesture of generosity could ensure Qingyun Sect’s loyal assistance.
After plundering all of Tianyan Sect’s resources, Chen Ping and his group left the now-destroyed immortal sect.
Behind them, Tianyan Peak’s ruins looked desolate under the setting sun, as if mourning the tragic end of a great sect.
Just as Chen Ping and his group departed, several dark figures appeared!
“That kid again, he’s wiped out two sects in a row!”
One of the figures frowned and said!
This figure was from the mysterious organisation Chen Ping had injured and driven off!
They had returned with reinforcements, tracking Chen Ping, though he was unaware!
He was now heading towards Blood Shadow Palace!
“Chen Ping, you promised me, let me handle Blood Shadow Palace. Don’t make a move; if you kill a few, I’ll be heartbroken.”
On the way, Hu Mazi reminded Chen Ping.
“Don’t worry, I won’t act and risk dying of boredom. Play as much as you want, then kill!”
Chen Ping said, exasperated!
“Master Hu, Blood Shadow Palace has tens of thousands of followers. Can you… handle that many alone?”
Yun Wuya quietly asked Hu Mazi!
“How many?” Hu Mazi was stunned, “Tens of thousands of female cultivators?”
Now Hu Mazi was dumbfounded; tens of thousands of female cultivators? He’d exhaust himself to death!
“That’s a bit much.” Hu Mazi frowned, “How about killing the ugly ones first? Ugly ones deserve to die…”
“Keep the pretty ones, that should do it!”
