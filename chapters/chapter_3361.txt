Upon seeing Chen Pingzhi, Demon Mountain Ghost Elder rushed forward and said, “Mr Chen, are you alright? I heard that someone is looking for you?”
“Ghost Elder, I’m fine, it’s just that someone just tried to make me kneel down and apologise.”
Chen Ping said with a faint smile!
Upon hearing this, the Demon Mountain Ghost Elder instantly became furious, and immediately turned his gaze towards that Cheng Jinghui and said, “Surnamed Cheng, was it you who told Mr Chen to kneel down and apologise?”
“What the f*ck are you, how dare you make Mr Chen kneel and apologise? I see that your Blood Spirit Peak doesn’t want to stay ……”
Although the strength of the Devil Mountain Ghost Old Man was not as strong as that Cheng Jinghui, the moment Cheng Jinghui saw the Devil Mountain Ghost Old Man, he actually showed a few moments of fear on his face!
Devil Mountain ghost old this scolding, Cheng Jing will not dare to refute, can only awkwardly smile: “Ghost old, this …… this little Taoist friend with you still have a relationship?”
“Bullsh*t, speaking of which I still have to address Mr Chen as my old ancestor, you dare to let my old ancestor kneel down and apologise to you, believe it or not I will die with you now?”
The Devil Mountain Ghost Elder roared angrily!
Cheng Jing would be instantly confused, he really didn’t understand how a human cultivator who had just stepped into the Transition Realm had become the oldest ancestor of such a demonic cultivator as Devil Mountain Ghost Elder!
However, looking at the expression of the Demon Mountain Ghost Old Man, Cheng Jinghui could only concede, “Misunderstanding, this is all a misunderstanding ……”
“Master ……” Liu Xueyi saw Cheng Jinghui even concede, so he shouted somewhat reluctantly!
“Shut up, you, a Transitional Realm Fourth Grade was having your hand broken by someone else’s Transitional Realm First Grade, you still have the face to say it.”
Cheng Jinghui yelled at Liu Xueyi, then pulled and left!
Seeing that the crowd didn’t fight, they slowly all dispersed!
While Chen Ping asked with some curiosity, “Ghost old man, you are now afraid that your strength is not as good as that Cheng Jing will be, why is he so afraid of you?”
The Devil Mountain Ghost Elder laughed when he heard that!
While Luo Shouhai explained with a smile, “Mr Chen is unaware of this, in fact, we and Ghost Old Man have known each other since childhood, back then, our two clans weren’t too far apart, and we often travelled back and forth.”
“And this senior brother of mine has been bullied by the ghost old man since he was a child, when he sees the ghost old man, he trembles, although later on, that senior brother of mine went to the Blood Spirit Peak, and I don’t know what opportunity he got, his strength has increased greatly, but even so, when he sees the ghost old man, he still trembles.”
“This may be the heart shadow that fell from childhood, the entire Heavenly Demon Mountain knows that my that senior brother trembles when he sees the ghost old man ……”
When Chen Ping heard this, he could not help but laugh, it seems that this childhood shadow, it is very difficult to eliminate!
“Ji Yun, give the money to people ……”
Chen Ping asked Ji Yun to give the 100,000 spirit coins to the big man selling the clock!
Ji Yun nodded and threw the money over, and the big man was not polite and just took it!
Getting the money, the big man collected the stall and left!
When the big man left, Chen Ping did suddenly freeze, his eyes filled with doubt!
Because just now when Cheng Jing would explode his aura to make a move, everyone couldn’t afford to dodge away, while the big man remained motionless sitting in front of the stall.
At that time, Chen Ping was desperately resisting Cheng Jinghui’s aura, so he did not pay too much attention to this big man, but now, it seemed that the strength of this big man who set up the stall was definitely not simple!
“Mr Chen, what’s wrong?” Ghost Old Man asked!
“Oh, nothing!” Chen Ping smiled faintly, then took out the clock and said, “Ghost Elder, Luo Gu Master, can you see what’s so special about this clock?”
The ghost old man followed by Luo Shouhai took the clock and looked at it for half a day, then all shook their heads, “This clock is just carved with jade, although it is lifelike, there is nothing special about it ah ……”
Chen Ping saw that the ghost old man and Luo Shouhai could not see anything special, so he put the clock away, but he always felt that there must be something special about this clock!
