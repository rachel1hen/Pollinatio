With a sharp “clang,” the black-robed figure’s claw struck the light barrier, sending ripples across its surface.
Hu Mazi felt a tremendous force hit him, his blood surging, forcing him to stumble back half a step.
“A mere grain of pearl dares to shine?” the black-robed figure sneered, increasing the force of his claw by a third, causing web-like cracks to spread across the light barrier.
At that moment, a golden sword qi sliced through like an immortal from beyond the heavens, forcing the black-robed figure to halt his attack and dodge to the side.
Chen Ping followed closely, his Dragon-Slaying Sword thrusting relentlessly, drawing the other two into the fray.
“Your opponent is me!” the lead black-robed figure finally acted, wielding a black whip that writhed like a living snake, lashing towards Chen Ping’s face with a piercing whistle.
The whip was studded with tiny barbs glinting with eerie green light, clearly laced with deadly poison.
Chen Ping didn’t dare meet it head-on, his footwork shifting as he moved with the ease of a stroll through a courtyard.
Chen Ping’s figure darted through the forest like a phantom, his left hand supporting the weakened Hu Mazi, his right gripping the Dragon-Slaying Sword, occasionally turning to unleash a golden sword qi to fend off the relentless black-robed pursuers.
The lead black-robed figure wielded the black whip, which seemed alive in his hands, sometimes striking like a viper’s tongue, other times coiling like a python, each attack carrying a bone-chilling menace that forced Chen Ping to divert his focus.
“Chen Ping, forget about me, just go!” Hu Mazi struggled to break free, knowing he was a burden and that both would be caught if this continued.
“Shut up and focus on recovering!” Chen Ping snapped, his footwork weaving through the dense forest to evade the whip’s grasp, “We came out together, and I won’t abandon a comrade!”
As he spoke, two black shadows closed in from behind, attacking from both sides.
The black-robed figure on the left brandished a bone blade riddled with tiny holes, emitting a foul stench, while the one on the right formed hand seals, muttering incantations, causing countless black vines to sprout from the ground like chains, snaking towards their ankles.
With enemies ahead and pursuers behind, the situation was dire.
Chen Ping’s eyes sharpened, his spiritual energy erupting without restraint, the Dragon-Slaying Sword letting out a clear hum as golden sword qi surged like a tide, instantly repelling the attacks from both sides.
“Now’s our chance!” Seizing the fleeting opportunity, he surged forward, carrying Hu Mazi as he leaped into the canopy of a towering ancient tree.
The black-robed figures followed, landing on surrounding branches, encircling them.
The leader slowly raised his head, red light flickering under his hood, “Chen Ping, you can’t escape, come back with us to see Her Majesty the Demoness, and you might keep your life.”
“Sent by Youyue to silence us, were you?” Chen Ping sneered, his gaze sweeping over the three, “She’s afraid we’ll uncover the truth about the clan’s destruction, so she wants to cut the roots.”
The black-robed figures stiffened imperceptibly, clearly struck by his words.
The leader’s red eyes flared brighter, “Since you know everything, you’re even less worth sparing!”
He lashed out with the whip, the black whip darting like a spirit snake towards the canopy, its tip whistling sharply towards Chen Ping’s face.
At the same time, the other two attacked, the bone blade and vines weaving a deadly net enveloping the canopy.
Chen Ping took a deep breath, activating his Unbreakable Golden Body, golden scales covering him.
Shielding Hu Mazi behind him, he flourished the Dragon-Slaying Sword, meeting the whip head-on.
“Clang!”
The clash of metal echoed through the forest, golden sword qi colliding with the black whip, sparking a shower of light.
