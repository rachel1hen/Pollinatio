The other two divine guards, seeing this, quickly turned to rescue him.
Hu Mazi took the opportunity to throw out a binding talisman, tying up one of the divine guards. Chen Ping then swung his sword horizontally, forcing back the other divine guard.
The woman also seized the chance. Golden light surged from her fingertips, and she struck a palm on the chest of the bound divine guard. The divine guard spat out blood and fell to the ground.
The leading divine guard knew he was no match. He gritted his teeth and said, “Who are you? How dare you interfere in the affairs of the Divine Kingdom!”
Chen Ping did not answer, merely looking at him coldly. “Get lost. If you dare to harass again, you die.”
Golden flames faintly ignited on his body, releasing an invisible pressure in an instant. The leading divine guard’s face turned pale. He dared not say another word, helped his injured companion, and fled in embarrassment.
The battle ended, leaving only Chen Ping and Hu Mazi on the clearing, along with the divine clan woman.
The woman retracted her divine powers, glanced at the two, her eyes showing no gratitude at all, but rather a trace of vigilance and arrogance.
She wiped the blood from her shoulder and turned to leave.
“Hey, little lady!”
Hu Mazi could not help but speak up. “We saved you. Even if you don’t sleep with me, you should at least say thank you, right?”
The woman paused, turned back to look at Hu Mazi, her tone icy. “Human cultivator, don’t think that saving me gives you the right to boss me around. If I weren’t in poor condition today, those three wastes wouldn’t be my opponents at all.”
With that, she did not linger, turned and walked into the depths of the dense forest, soon disappearing from sight.
Hu Mazi stood there stunned, so angry that he blew his beard and glared. “What the hell is this? Are the divine clan all so arrogant? I really want to catch her back and teach her what politeness is!”
Chen Ping shook his head helplessly. “Forget it, the divine clan has always been like this. However, she mentioned that the Divine Kingdom is allying with the Six Halls of the Divine Temple, and they want to marry her to the son of the Third Hall Master. This is important information.”
“Alliance?”
Hu Mazi frowned. “Aren’t the Divine Kingdom and the Divine Temple at odds? How could they ally?”
Chen Ping pondered for a moment. “Perhaps for mutual benefits. In any case, this is not good for us. If the Divine Kingdom allies with the Six Halls of the Divine Temple, it will be even harder for us to eliminate the Sixth Hall Master.”
The two no longer dwelled on the divine clan woman and continued flying towards the direction of Thunder Sound Mountain.
Along the way, they encountered several groups of divine guards from the Divine Kingdom, evidently searching for the woman’s whereabouts.
The divine guards saw Chen Ping and Hu Mazi. Although somewhat vigilant, after sensing Hu Mazi’s Earth Immortal Realm Ninth Grade aura, they did not act rashly.
About three hours later, a towering mountain peak appeared ahead, shrouded in clouds and mist. The outline of a Taoist temple could vaguely be seen, with a golden thunder light flashing at the top, emanating a majestic aura.
“That’s Thunder Sound Mountain!”
A flash of excitement passed through Hu Mazi’s eyes, and he sped up.
The two landed at the foot of Thunder Sound Mountain, where two Taoist priests in cyan robes were guarding the mountain path. Seeing Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, they stepped forward and saluted with clasped hands. “Fellow Daoists, may I ask what brings you to Thunder Sound Temple?”
Chen Ping returned the salute with clasped hands. “I am Chen Ping, and this is Hu Mazi. We have come to pay our respects to Daoist Wuji.”
The two Taoist priests exchanged a glance, and one of them said, “So you are Chen Ping. Please follow us.”
“You two know me?” Chen Ping was somewhat curious.
“Our Daoist said that if someone named Chen Ping comes looking for him, bring him to see him immediately.”
One Taoist priest said.
Chen Ping did not expect that Daoist Wuji had already guessed that he would come to Thunder Sound Temple to find him!
The two followed the Taoist priests up the mountain path, lined with pine trees on both sides, the air filled with a faint scent of sandalwood and immortal energy.
About half an hour later, they arrived at the front gate of Thunder Sound Temple.
The main gate of Thunder Sound Temple was made of purple sandalwood, engraved with the three golden characters “Thunder Sound Temple”. On both sides of the gate stood a stone lion each, exuding an aura that warded off evil.
