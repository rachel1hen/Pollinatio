As six figures appeared simultaneously, Chen Ping, who had been fighting alone, now surrounded the cloth-robed man!
The Dragon-Slaying Sword blazed with light, each swing carrying an unstoppable momentum, as if determined to shatter every obstacle in its path.
“Hmm…”
The cloth-robed man frowned, suddenly thrusting his long sword into the ground!
“Immovable as a Mountain…”
With a loud shout, countless swords materialized around him, encircling the cloth-robed man completely!
He stood still, but the swords around him moved as if guided by his will, striking out relentlessly!
For a moment, their sword techniques clashed fiercely within the sea of swords, waves of sword qi spilling out, shattering rocks on the mountain peak into dust wherever they struck.
The ground was carved with deep, bottomless trenches by the sword qi, the entire mountaintop looking as though it had been ravaged by a giant hand.
Amid this intense battle, Chen Ping gradually entered a strange state.
His mind cleared of all distractions, his eyes focused solely on the man’s sword moves.
Every swing, every motion from his opponent played out in slow motion before his eyes, crystal clear.
He began to glean new insights from the man’s swordsmanship, the complex techniques slowly becoming orderly and comprehensible in his mind.
“So that’s it, the flaw in this move is right here…”
Chen Ping muttered to himself, his six clones merging back into one in an instant!
At the same time, the Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand shifted its trajectory, no longer just blocking or attacking head-on.
Instead, he deftly avoided the sharp edge of the man’s sword moves, seeking out weak points to counterattack.
The cloth-robed man noticed Chen Ping’s shift, a flicker of surprise in his eyes, “Interesting, you can actually comprehend new sword intent mid-battle, but do you think that’s enough to beat me?”
The cloth-robed man moved, his aura surging dramatically.
His swordsmanship transformed as well, the once quantity-driven sword rain now condensing into something far more refined.
Each strand of sword qi seemed to hold the power to destroy heaven and earth, warping the space it passed through.
“Starfall Sword Domain!”
With a soft shout, countless streams of sword qi erupted from the ground, like a galaxy cascading downward.
These weren’t ordinary energy, each strand carried the trajectory of celestial orbits, bearing the oppressive weight of the heavens.
Chen Ping felt his feet sink as if into a quagmire, his meridians faintly aching under the immense stellar force.
He plunged the Dragon-Slaying Sword into the ground, the Heart-Calming Technique in his body churning wildly, absorbing all the Starfall sword qi within a ten-zhang radius.
The cloth-robed man’s pupils contracted, the sudden vacuum in his sword domain causing a momentary pause in his assault.
“You can actually absorb sword qi?”
The man’s sword stance shifted abruptly.
His long sword traced a mysterious arc, its light splitting into yin-yang dual fish, the left side blazing like the sun, the right side chilling like the moon.
Boom!
The clash of sword qi erupted in a blinding flash, the chaotic sword wheel colliding with the sun-moon dual wheels, tearing three pitch-black rifts in the void.
Chen Ping’s grip split open, his sword nearly flying from his hand, his body crisscrossed with cracks as blood seeped out continuously.
Staring at the cloth-robed man, his eyes were filled with shock, he hadn’t expected the second tier’s guardian to be this freakishly strong?
How had Yun Li and the others made it to the fourth tier?
“Chen Ping, are you okay?” Lin Keting asked nervously, seeing his state!
Hong Yao and Lan Yao were equally dumbfounded.
“Sister, when we challenged him earlier, he didn’t seem this strong, did he?”
Lan Yao asked!
“Definitely not, is this guy deliberately targeting Young Master Chen?”
Hong Yao found it odd too, if the cloth-robed man had been this powerful before, the sisters would’ve lost in a single move!
