“A bit too arrogant, huh?” Chen Ping gave an awkward smile!
“Chen Ping, you’ve gone too far, just arriving in Wuwang Land and already flirting with girls, huh?”
Seeing Hong Yao so close to Chen Ping, looking all cozy, Lin Keting couldn’t hold back anymore!
When Chen Ping had first entered the Dao Sect with Hong Yao and Lan Yao, Lin Keting was already unhappy!
But since the three kept their distance, perhaps just traveling together, Lin Keting hadn’t flared up!
Now, with Hong Yao practically whispering in Chen Ping’s ear, looking like they were about to kiss, Lin Keting wasn’t having it!
Chen Ping froze, looking at the furious Lin Keting, and hurriedly said, “Don’t misunderstand, I’m not flirting…”
“What’s that way to talk? Calling us girls right off the bat? I think you’re the girl, you old hag…” Lan Yao fired back at Lin Keting!
Clearly, Lan Yao didn’t know who Lin Keting was, if she’d known she was the princess of Sun Moon City, she probably wouldn’t have dared!
“You dare call me an old hag? I’ll tear your mouth apart!”
Lin Keting charged straight at Lan Yao!
Lan Yao didn’t back down, after all, Lin Keting’s strength wasn’t a match for hers!
Just then, a web of crisscrossing threads suddenly appeared between heaven and earth, and Hua Yueying stepped out from the crowd.
She knew Lin Keting couldn’t beat Lan Yao, so she cast a formation, instantly binding Hong Yao and Lan Yao!
“Hua Yueying, what’s the meaning of this?” Lan Yao frowned at the approaching Hua Yueying!
Obviously, they all knew each other!
“Nothing much, just keep your sisters away from my man. In Wuwang Land, your reputation isn’t exactly stellar, don’t drag my man down!” Hua Yueying said coldly!
Hong Yao and Lan Yao: “Your man?”
The surrounding crowd was equally stunned, wondering when Hua Yueying had become Chen Ping’s woman!
Most people watched with glee, relishing the drama!
This wife-catching-mistress scene was the best kind of show, though in the Celestial Realm, having three wives and four concubines was normal, so the “mistress” label didn’t quite apply!
But four women squaring off like this was still a spectacle!
“Alright, stop making a scene, it’s a misunderstanding…” Chen Ping tried to smooth things over in the middle!
He’d come to show off, but now he was a laughingstock, how embarrassing!
He’d come to show off, but now he was a laughingstock, how embarrassing!
“This is the Dao Sect, not a place for you to bicker and roll around…”
At that moment, an elder in a wide black robe stepped out from the crowd!
“Isn’t that an elder from the Qian family of the Triple Alliance? Didn’t expect the Qian family to show up so early.”
“The Qian family has a stake here too, they help maintain order at the Dao Sect, looks like Chen Ping’s in for it now.”
“Third-grade Transcendent Immortal realm, seems the Qian family’s got big plans for the Heaven-Climbing Ladder this time!”
The crowd buzzed with discussion as they saw the elder emerge!
Chen Ping frowned slightly, looking at the elder, “This is my family business, who the hell are you to meddle?”
The elder was stunned!
The rest of the crowd was equally shocked!
What the heck!
A third-grade Transcendent Immortal cultivator, and Chen Ping dared to be so arrogant toward him?
In the shadows, the Tenth Hall Master frowned, his expression growing grave!
He recognised this elder, a Qian Sect elder, and the Qian Sect wasn’t to be trifled with!
The Qian Elder in the Tenth Hall was a founding figure of the Qian Sect, wielding high status thanks to his divination skills after joining the Hall!
“Kid, you’re courting death…”
The elder’s face darkened instantly, being insulted like this in front of so many people was intolerable!
Swish!
Before the elder could finish, Chen Ping’s Dragon-Slaying Sword slashed toward him!
Since he was here to show off, and someone had jumped out to play along, Chen Ping wasn’t about to miss the chance!
The sword came down!
But the elder shifted his body slightly, and the Dragon-Slaying Sword grazed past him, not even scratching him!
Chen Ping blinked, “Divination technique?”
He’d meant to show off, but this guy knew divination too, predicting his sword’s trajectory and dodging effortlessly!
Instead of impressing, he’d been slapped in the face.
What rotten luck…
