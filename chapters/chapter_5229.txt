“So that’s how it is…”
Chen Ping suddenly understood, “There really is a passage to the Fifth Heaven in Luoxian Valley, but the way to open it is by activating the core restriction here. No wonder those forces dared to venture into Luoxian Valley, their target was never us, but the passage to the Fifth Heaven!”
Hu Mazi’s face darkened as he realised, “So, we’ve been used as bait from the start?”
Chen Ping nodded, “Very likely. Youyue Demoness and Chilian Fairy must have known how to open the passage all along. They deliberately issued the kill order to lure the major forces into Luoxian Valley, using our blood to activate the core restriction.”
At that moment, the runes around the altar lit up, and a massive spatial rift slowly opened above it, emitting the unique aura of the Fifth Heaven.
Chen Ping frowned, sensing several powerful presences rapidly approaching.
He knew that their only option now was to head to the Fifth Heaven to escape their pursuers and uncover the truth behind the Hu clan’s destruction.
The moment they entered the spatial rift, Youyue Demoness and Chilian Fairy arrived.
Seeing the passage open, both women revealed ecstatic expressions and leapt in without hesitation.
The spatial rift slowly closed, and Luoxian Valley returned to its eerie calm, as if nothing had happened.
Only the scattered bones and broken ruins bore witness to the events that had transpired.
In the Fifth Heaven, above a mountain range called Black Wind Ridge, the space twisted, and Chen Ping and Hu Mazi stumbled out, dishevelled.
The spiritual energy in the Fifth Heaven was several times denser than in the Fourth Heaven, making it hard for them to adjust at first.
“Is this the Fifth Heaven?” Hu Mazi asked, curiously surveying the surroundings.
The mountains of Black Wind Ridge were far grander than those in the Fourth Heaven, the sky tinged with a faint purple hue, and the air thick with spiritual energy.
Chen Ping nodded, feeling his spiritual power rapidly recovering under the nourishment of the Fifth Heaven’s energy, “Indeed, this is the Fifth Heaven. But we need to leave quickly, who knows if Youyue Demoness and the others will catch up.”
As they stood up, a powerful aura suddenly locked onto them.
Chen Ping’s expression changed, and he pulled Hu Mazi to flee, but a beam of golden light blocked their path.
A tall, burly middle-aged cultivator appeared before them, standing over two metres tall with a scar across his face, exuding the terrifying aura of an Earth Immortal Realm Fifth Grade.
Chen Ping gripped his Dragon-Slaying Sword tightly, eyeing the man warily, “Who are you? Why are you blocking our path?”
The cultivator sneered, “In Black Wind Ridge, no one dares speak to me like that. I am the master of Black Wind Ridge, Black Bear Daoist. You two look unfamiliar, probably just arrived from the Fourth Heaven, eh? Perfect, I’m short two servants, so I’ll take you both.”
He added, “And you, a mere Scattered Immortal Realm cultivator, must have something special to reach the Fifth Heaven. Serve me, and no one will dare bully you.”
Hu Mazi shouted angrily, “In your dreams! We’re not pushovers to be toyed with!”
