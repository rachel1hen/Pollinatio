Nan Batian’s arms bulged with veins, his iron-like fists crashing down, “Mr. Chen, take this punch!”
A gust of wind whipped up gravel, slamming into Chen Ping’s chest, but he spun with the momentum, his body shimmering with a faint golden glow.
As the two traded blows, fists and feet flying, the entire mountain trembled, startling flocks of birds into the sky, blotting out the sun.
“A body like a cauldron, tempered by divine will.”
Nan Batian roared with laughter, suddenly pulling back his strength. Chen Ping felt his organs blaze as if forged in fire, exhaling a cloud of murky air that solidified into a swirling vortex of wind in midair.
Chen Ping, training solo against both Li Chunfeng and Nan Batian, left Lin Chong and Wuji Daoist watching in awe and trepidation!
Thanks to Chen Ping’s relentless drive, under the honing of Li Chunfeng and Nan Batian, his strength soared by leaps and bounds!
Truth be told, Nan Batian and Li Chunfeng genuinely liked Chen Ping. Though they’d promised to serve him for three hundred years, it was only through this period of training that they realised his talent and comprehension were once-in-a-millennium gifts!
And Chen Ping wasn’t the spoiled second-generation type they’d imagined. His strength was earned through sheer grit. Sometimes, beaten black and blue, he never once flinched!
Buzz…
One day, while Li Chunfeng and Nan Batian were still refining Chen Ping, the sky suddenly shifted, dark clouds rolling in ominously!
Seeing this, both of them were stunned!
“Is this a thunder tribulation cloud?”
Li Chunfeng said, his face full of shock!
“Who’s breaking through? It can’t be Mr. Chen, can it?”
Nan Batian stared at Chen Ping, standing with his sword, hardly daring to believe it!
“This thunder tribulation cloud is so terrifying, it shouldn’t be Mr. Chen, surely? He’s only at the third rank of Great Ascension Realm, how could he trigger such a fearsome tribulation cloud?”
Li Chunfeng said, equally incredulous!
“You two better step back, lest you get caught in the thunder tribulation. That’s indeed the cloud Chen Ping’s breakthrough has summoned!”
Wuji Daoist said to Li Chunfeng and Nan Batian!
“It’s really Mr. Chen’s? With a tribulation this intense, can he withstand it?”
Li Chunfeng exclaimed in alarm!
“You forgot, Mr. Chen even endured the Heavenly Dao power of a Golden Immortal. This tribulation won’t be a problem, let’s get out of the way!”
Nan Batian said, pulling Li Chunfeng aside!
As the tribulation clouds churned, streaks of lightning roiled within.
Boom!
Suddenly, a bolt of thunder crashed down!
Chen Ping stood motionless, offering no resistance at all!
Just like that, the tribulation ended. A faint charred scent wafted from Chen Ping’s body, yet he hadn’t suffered much harm!
His ability to withstand the thunder tribulation with his bare flesh owed a lot to Nan Batian!
After all, both Nan Batian and Li Chunfeng were immortals from the Heavenly Realm!
Chen Ping had now reached the fourth rank of Great Ascension Realm, though his exact strength remained a mystery to all!
After his breakthrough, Chen Ping stood still for a long while, eyes slightly closed, as if sensing something!
“What’s Mr. Chen doing?”
Nan Batian wondered aloud!
“Mr. Chen’s breakthrough this time seems to have brought him some kind of epiphany!” Li Chunfeng said, “Don’t disturb him!”
Under everyone’s bated breath, Chen Ping’s aura grew increasingly ethereal, as if silently aligning with some mysterious rhythm of the heavens and earth.
After a moment, he slowly opened his eyes, a glint of profound wisdom flashing within, and said gravely, “I’ve glimpsed a portion of the laws of heaven and earth. Their mysteries far exceed imagination.”
With that, Chen Ping raised his hand and took out the third of the four jade slips.
The slip felt warm and cool in his grasp, its runes faintly glowing with a life of their own, as if resonating with the power of the laws he’d just comprehended.
Chen Ping took a deep breath, gently extending his divine sense into the jade slip.
In an instant, the slip erupted in blinding light, an ancient, majestic aura surging forth like a tidal wave.
