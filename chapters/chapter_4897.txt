“You’re making it sound too serious, too serious. This is just a small effort on my part!”
“However, this Heavenly Ladder is merely a guide. How you reach the Celestial Realm, and where in the Celestial Realm you’ll be sent, I can’t control.”
“So, with your current realm, if you go to the Celestial Realm without a powerful backer, it’ll be tough to survive!”
The old man said to Chen Ping!
A cultivator who had just reached the Immortal Transformation Realm heading to the Celestial Realm would indeed struggle to get by!
“Thank you for the reminder, Senior. With my strength, surviving in the Celestial Realm shouldn’t be too hard!”
“Besides, I have Master Hu with me. I hope Senior will allow Master Hu to enter the guiding white light with me and ascend to the Celestial Realm!”
Chen Ping pointed to Hu Mazi beside him!
The old man glanced at Hu Mazi, his brows furrowing slightly in surprise, “Immortal bones? You’re a reincarnated soul?”
Hu Mazi nodded, “Reincarnated five times. It’s only in this life that I’ve regained my past memories!”
“Sigh, I can’t fathom what grave mistake you must’ve made to endure the torment of five reincarnations,” the old man sighed!
After all, an immortal could have their body destroyed and their soul rebuild it, or be sealed with their realm reduced!
But no one willingly subjected themselves to the agony of reincarnation!
In the eyes of immortals, enduring reincarnation and living as a mortal for a lifetime was the most painful trial!
Let alone Hu Mazi, who had suffered through five cycles of reincarnation!
“Do you know of the Jade Tiny Immortal?” Hu Mazi asked!
“Of course I do. The Jade Tiny Immortal is the coldest and most beautiful fairy in the Twelfth Heaven. Countless high-plane Immortal Venerables descended just to catch a glimpse of her, only to be turned away!”
“She’s the goddess in so many hearts, mine included. But alas, a thousand years ago, someone drugged her and took her chastity.”
“After that, the Jade Tiny Immortal seemed like a different person, falling into depravity. I hear she’s now become a female demon lord.”
“That bastard who took her chastity, what a damn disgrace. Back then, countless Immortal Venerables and Demon Lords descended to the Sixth Heaven to hunt him down!”
“But that guy also made plenty of people jealous—after all, he got to have the goddess of countless hearts!”
The old man’s eyes grew distant, lost in memories of the past!
Listening to the old man’s tale, Chen Ping couldn’t help but glance at Hu Mazi, suspecting this man was none other than him!
The old man suddenly froze, as if realising something, and turned to Hu Mazi, “You’re not that guy, are you?”
Hu Mazi nodded with a smile, “That’s me. But it wasn’t like the rumors say. The Jade Tiny Immortal willingly dual cultivated with me. Back then, I was dashing and debonair, just a bit of a playboy.”
“I dual cultivated with another fairy, and when she found out, she got furious. That’s why she spread those rumors, inciting everyone to hunt me down!”
“Later, the enraged mob cast me into reincarnation, and I endured five cycles of torment!” Hu Mazi explained!
“No way, how could the Jade Tiny Immortal willingly dual cultivate with you? She was pure as ice, untouchably aloof, the goddess of so many!” The old man flat-out refused to believe it!
“What do you know? The goddess you worship is sometimes just a woman someone else has grown tired of.”
“My brother here has the most say in this. He’s dual cultivated with dozens of women, many of whom were other people’s goddesses, but to him, they’re not even worth keeping around…”
Hu Mazi patted Chen Ping’s shoulder as he spoke!
Chen Ping thought about it, and it did seem to be true.
The old man looked shaken, his face darkening, before waving them off impatiently, “Go on, get out of here. Once you’re gone, I’m leaving too!”
The old man was clearly rattled—how could the goddess he’d always revered actively seek a man for dual cultivation?
Chen Ping led Hu Mazi into the guiding white light!
The old man vanished in an instant, and the Heavenly Ladder disappeared from the Celestial Human Realm, never to descend there again!
