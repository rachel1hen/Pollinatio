Zhao Jingfeng, terrified by the fearsome dragon aura, turned to flee.
But it was too late.
Chen Ping stepped forward, his figure appearing before Zhao Jingfeng like a phantom. The Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand radiated blinding golden light, carrying world-shattering fury as it slashed down.
“No!”
Zhao Jingfeng let out a desperate scream.
A sickening sound of flesh and bone separating echoed.
Under countless horrified gazes, Zhao Jingfeng’s body was cleaved from head to crotch by Chen Ping’s single strike, split cleanly in two.
Blood and viscera spilled across the ground, a gruesome sight.
The arena fell into deathly silence, everyone stunned by the sudden, bloody scene.
No one expected Chen Ping to kill Zhao Jingfeng so decisively, with such ruthless means.
On the VIP platform, Qin Lie shot to his feet, his face ashen, eyes filled with shock and rage. “Chen Ping! You dare kill someone from my Divine Sword Manor!”
Leaning on his sword, Chen Ping cast a cold glance at Qin Lie, his voice icy. “For a despicable sneak attacker, sparing his life would be a blasphemy to justice.”
With that, he ignored the crowd’s gazes, clutched his wounded left shoulder, and walked down from the arena step by step.
Sunlight bathed him, yet it seemed to carry a chilling aura of slaughter, making people shiver.
In this battle, Chen Ping not only displayed heaven-defying strength but also revealed his resolute, deadly side.
From now on, the name “Chen Ping” would be an indelible mark in countless hearts.
The crowd below remained silent for three full breaths before erupting into deafening uproar.
“He killed him!”
“Zhao Jingfeng… just died like that?”
“A sixth-rank Earth Immortal, split in half by an eighth-rank Loose Immortal!”
On the VIP platform, Qin Lie’s pupils contracted sharply. His fingers dug deep into the rosewood armrests, knuckles white as paper.
He stared at the mangled corpse on the arena, a beast-like growl escaping his throat. His spiritual energy surged uncontrollably, tearing several gashes in his ornate robe.
“Ah!”
A roar like thunder exploded. Qin Lie’s figure blurred into an afterimage, charging toward the arena with earth-shattering momentum.
The pressure of an eighth-rank Earth Immortal was like a tangible mountain, forcing weaker cultivators below to kneel, blood trickling from their mouths.
“Chen Ping! I’ll tear you to pieces!”
Just as Qin Lie’s palm was about to reach Chen Ping, several figures shot onto the arena like arrows, shielding Chen Ping.
Leading them was Mo Chen, his sword held across his chest. Though shaken by Qin Lie’s pressure, his blood surging, he stood tall.
“Master Qin! Stop!”
Following him were over a dozen Sword Sect disciples, swiftly forming a sword array. Their sword lights wove into a net, protecting Chen Ping tightly.
Ling Xue’s eyes burned with anger as she glared at Qin Lie. “Zhao Jingfeng attacked after surrendering. His death was deserved. Does Master Qin intend to bully with his power?”
Qin Lie’s gaze, sharp as a poisoned blade, swept over the Sword Sect members before landing on Chen Ping. “Bully? My disciple was brutally killed by this beast. No one can protect him today!”
“Brutally killed?”
Mo Chen laughed in fury, pointing his sword at Zhao Jingfeng’s corpse. “Master Qin, open your eyes! Who attacked after surrendering? Who violated the spirit of martial arts with a sneak attack? Zhao Jingfeng’s death was just. He shamed Divine Sword Manor!”
“You seek death!”
Stung by the truth, Qin Lie redirected his palm toward Mo Chen.
“Such arrogance, Master Qin!”
An aged voice rang out. The Sword Saint City’s overseer stepped slowly onto the arena, his whisk flicking lightly, dissolving Qin Lie’s palm strike into nothing. “This is Sword Saint City. How dare you act so brazenly?”
