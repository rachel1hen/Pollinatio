This sword, imbued with the supreme demonic power of the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord, carried the will to destroy everything, the air before the blade forcibly ignited, forming a burning black trail.
The leader of Tianyuan Pavilion let out a shrill roar, mustering all his strength to activate the blood-red coffin, while the power of the blood corpse raged within him, transforming his entire being into a massive blood-red orb of light, charging towards Chen Ping’s Dragon-Slaying Sword.
“Pfft…”
The blade sliced through the blood-red orb, striking the blood-red coffin.
This time, there was no earth-shattering explosion, only a dull tearing sound.
The Crimson Cloud Demon Flame furiously eroded the blood-red coffin, the cracks on its lid rapidly widening, “crack”, the entire coffin shattered completely, turning into countless blood-red fragments that dissipated into the air.
The leader of Tianyuan Pavilion let out a terrified scream, losing the protection of the blood-red coffin, he was directly exposed to Chen Ping’s sword.
The demonic flame of the Dragon-Slaying Sword instantly enveloped his body, beginning to furiously burn the blood corpse energy within him.
“No…! Lord Blood Corpse, save me!”
The leader of Tianyuan Pavilion roared in despair, attempting to summon the power of the blood corpse, but the Crimson Cloud Demon Flame clung to him like maggots on bone, relentlessly suppressing the corpse energy within him.
There was no pity in Chen Ping’s eyes, he recalled Sang Tianyang’s sacrifice, the devastation of the Asura Hall, his wrist flicked, and the Dragon-Slaying Sword, carrying raging demonic flames, slashed down from the top of the leader’s head.
“Ah…!”
A piercing scream echoed through the heavens, the body of the Tianyuan Pavilion leader burned inch by inch in the Crimson Cloud Demon Flame, turning to ash.
In the end, even the remnant soul of the blood corpse within him was completely incinerated by the demonic flame, leaving only a faint smell of blood and char in the air.
The wind gradually stilled.
Chen Ping sheathed the Dragon-Slaying Sword, the Crimson Cloud Demon Flame on his body slowly receding, he gasped heavily, his face pale as paper, clearly paying a great price for borrowing the Demon Lord’s power.
He looked at the ruins before him, at the scattered corpses, his eyes filled with exhaustion and sorrow.
Huo Jingjing and the others hurriedly stepped forward, supporting the swaying Chen Ping.
“Chen Ping, are you alright?” Huo Jingjing asked with concern.
Chen Ping shook his head, his gaze turning towards the direction of the Asura Hall, his voice hoarse, “I’m fine… it’s just, the Asura Hall…”
Mo Qingyun sighed softly, saying, “Let’s first see if there are any survivors.”
The group searched through the ruins, ultimately finding only a few heavily injured, unconscious disciples of the Asura Hall, all on the brink of death.
Chen Ping looked at the grieving Sang Lan, then at the traces left by Sang Tianyang’s self-destruction in the distance, his heart filled with mixed emotions.
Though he had slain the leader of Tianyuan Pavilion, the Asura Hall was already destroyed, and Sang Tianyang was gone forever.
Sang Lan slowly stood up, then deeply bowed to Chen Ping!
“Mr. Chen, thank you, thank you for avenging the Asura Hall, for avenging my father!”
Though Sang Lan was heartbroken, she was deeply grateful to Chen Ping!
“Miss Sang, if I had come earlier, perhaps Hall Master Sang wouldn’t have died!”
Chen Ping felt some self-blame!
“It’s fate, it has nothing to do with you!” Sang Lan shook her head!
“What will you do next?” Chen Ping asked with concern!
Sang Lan glanced at the Asura Hall, now reduced to ruins, and the mountain of corpses, falling into a moment of confusion!
“I want to rebuild the Asura Hall…” After a moment, Sang Lan said!
“Just you?” Chen Ping frowned slightly!
With Sang Lan’s strength, rebuilding the Asura Hall would be harder than ascending to the heavens!
“And me…”
At that moment, a figure slowly approached from the horizon!
As the figure drew near, Chen Ping was slightly stunned, and Sang Lan was also surprised.
“Great Elder?” Sang Lan exclaimed in shock!
“Miss, the Asura Hall has been destroyed, we have a responsibility to rebuild it.”
“From now on, I will swear to assist Miss in rebuilding the Asura Hall!”
With that, the Great Elder glanced at the sea of corpses and blood, his eyes filled with tears!
Sang Lan nodded firmly, with the Great Elder’s assistance, rebuilding the Asura Hall was now within reach!
