Before the white-robed woman could finish speaking, the overwhelming black mist had already surged a hundred metres away, carrying the chilling sound of grinding bones.
Mad Immortal’s face changed drastically, his body trembling violently, “It’s the vanguard of the Soul-Devouring Demon Army!”
From the black mist, hundreds of skeletons clad in tattered armour slowly emerged, their hollow eye sockets flickering with eerie green ghost fire, bone blades in hand glinting with cold menace.
More terrifying still, each skeleton was entwined with dozens of hair-thin black threads, their other ends stretching into the depths of the mist, as if manipulated by some horrific entity.
Gadfly, dragging his severed arm, staggered to his feet, spitting out a mouthful of blood, “Damn it… I can still kill!”
The remaining Rhino City warriors instinctively gathered, shielding the injured Chen Ping in their centre.
Bai Yi forced himself to stand, picking up a blood-stained longsword from the ground, its tip trembling slightly.
Hu Mazi gritted his teeth and pulled out a yellowed talisman, his last life-saving charm, “Everyone, I’m afraid we’re done for today.”
The purple-robed elder suddenly tossed his thunder seal into the air, the seal expanding to several metres in size, countless electric serpents slithering across its surface, “I’ll burn a century of cultivation to summon the Nine Heavens Divine Thunder, holding them off as long as I can!”
At this critical moment, Chen Ping suddenly convulsed violently, his Dragon-Slaying Sword emitting a piercing hum.
The white-robed woman hurriedly held him down, “Don’t move! You’re too badly injured…”
Before she could finish, Chen Ping’s eyes widened, no longer human but beast-like vertical pupils, their depths flickering with eerie blood-red flames.
Even more terrifying, the cracks on his skin began oozing golden liquid, which coalesced in the air into tiny blood beads, bizarrely floating.
A sharp screech suddenly came from the depths of the mist, and all the skeleton soldiers halted, turning in unison towards Chen Ping’s direction.
The purple-robed elder’s face changed, “Not good! He’s awakening his bloodline power!”
Chen Ping slowly levitated, the floating blood beads converging towards him as if summoned, forming a pair of faintly visible golden wings behind him.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword began to glow with golden light, seemingly resonating with Chen Ping.
The mist sea churned violently, revealing the vague outline of a colossal creature.
It was a bone dragon the size of a mountain, its hollow eye sockets burning with purple soul fire, each vertebra pierced with countless black spikes.
The bone dragon opened its maw, but instead of a roar, it unleashed the wails of thousands of tormented souls.
The purple-robed elder’s thunder seal cracked under the sonic impact, a trickle of blood seeping from his mouth, “It’s the Soul-Devouring Dragon Lord… the Demon Dragon Hall sent such a being…”
The fully transformed Chen Ping let out a dragon’s roar, his golden blood wings enveloping him, his entire form turning into a golden dragon.
This was Chen Ping’s first bloodline awakening, each time he unleashed the divine dragon power, a golden dragon shadow would appear behind him.
But now, Chen Ping had truly and completely become a golden dragon!
Chen Ping shot towards the bone dragon as a streak of golden light.
The moment they collided, the resulting shockwave shattered all skeleton soldiers within a hundred metres.
Golden light and black mist clashed wildly in the air, each collision causing subtle distortions in space.
The people on the ground were knocked over by the violent gusts, the white-robed woman barely anchoring herself by plunging her broken spear into the earth.
She noticed in horror that the centre of the battle was beginning to form spatial rifts, tiny black lightning crackling at their edges.
The purple-robed elder said in shock, “The power of the golden dragon’s bloodline is too terrifying, no wonder the young miss wanted to save him…”
The white-robed woman, full of disbelief, “He… he’s actually of the golden dragon bloodline?”
