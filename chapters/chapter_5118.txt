“Somewhat interesting, it actually awakened the remnant soul of this old thing.”
He licked his lips, the power of the blood corpse surging wildly within him, “But a remnant soul is just a remnant soul, daring to come out and court death?”
The ancestor said nothing, only raising a massive skeletal palm, slamming it fiercely towards the master of Tianyuan Pavilion.
Before the palm wind arrived, the ground below had already been blasted into a bottomless ravine, the air compressed into a visible shockwave, grinding the surrounding ruins into dust.
The master of Tianyuan Pavilion did not dodge or evade, his hands forming seals. A massive blood-coloured coffin suddenly appeared before him, the very one that had sealed the blood corpse earlier!
The coffin lid burst open, releasing a soul-shuddering stench. Countless blood-red tendrils extended from within, wrapping around the master, forming a sturdy blood-coloured shield.
“Boom…”
The skeletal palm struck the blood shield heavily, causing the entire Shura Hall ruins to shake violently. Dark clouds churned in the sky, lightning flashing and thunder roaring.
Countless cracks appeared on the blood shield, but it ultimately withstood the blow.
The master of Tianyuan Pavilion let out a muffled grunt, a trickle of blood seeping from the corner of his mouth, yet his eyes gleamed with excitement, “Impressive indeed, but is that all you’ve got?”
He thrust both hands into the blood-coloured coffin, eliciting a piercing wail from within. An even greater surge of blood corpse energy was drawn out, transforming into a beam of blood-red light shooting towards the ancestor.
Where the beam passed, space shattered like glass. The ancestor’s skeletal frame was struck, emitting a “crack, crack” sound of breaking bones, the golden flames in its eye sockets flickering violently, nearly extinguishing.
“No! Ancestor!”
Sang Tianyang’s eyes bulged with rage, he could feel the ancestor’s remnant soul rapidly dissipating.
The ancestor let out a mournful roar, its skeletal body exploding into countless bone shards shooting in all directions, attempting to take the master of Tianyuan Pavilion down with it.
But the master merely waved a hand, and the blood-red tendrils pulverised all the bone shards, not even stirring a ripple.
The ancestor’s remnant soul was completely annihilated, and the ancient aura of majesty in the world vanished with it.
The master of Tianyuan Pavilion slowly approached Sang Tianyang, each step treading on the corpses of Shura Hall disciples, blood splashing and staining his robe red.
“Now, your tricks are exhausted,” his voice was chillingly cold, “I’ll ask you one last time, where is the Shura Blood Crystal?”
Sang Tianyang looked at the piles of corpses around him, at the broken walls left by his father, the last trace of hesitation in his eyes fading away.
He knew he had no way out.
“Want the Shura Blood Crystal… then step over my corpse!”
He suddenly straightened his body, his once-dull eyes blazing with brilliance. The vital blood in his dantian no longer burned but condensed frantically, forming a dazzling blood-red orb.
“Shura Hall… would rather die than yield!”
The master of Tianyuan Pavilion’s pupils contracted, he hadn’t expected Sang Tianyang to choose to detonate his dantian!
“Courting death!” He swiftly retreated, raising the blood-coloured coffin to shield himself.
“Boom!!!”
A deafening explosion rang out, Sang Tianyang’s body transforming into a blood-red mushroom cloud.
A terrifying energy shockwave spread outwards from him, sweeping up the surrounding debris, corpse fragments, and everything else into the sky, forming a gruesome storm of blood and flesh.
The blood-coloured coffin trembled violently under the shockwave, its surface covered in countless fine cracks. The master of Tianyuan Pavilion was also shaken, blood surging within him, another trickle escaping his mouth.
Yet, when the explosion’s light faded, the master parted the blood mist before him, only to see an empty ruin.
Sang Tianyang’s self-detonation, though powerful, failed to harm his core, merely shattering the last shred of Shura Hall’s dignity.
“Foolish fool.”
