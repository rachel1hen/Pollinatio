Chen Ping remained silent, his gaze fixed intently on the runes, the Dragon-Slaying Sword already unsheathed in his hand, its blade glinting with a cold light.
He took a deep breath and swung the Dragon-Slaying Sword with force, unleashing a sharp sword qi that slashed towards the stone wall.
The sword qi exploded against the stone wall, sending dust and smoke billowing, but when the dust settled, the stone wall stood unscathed, not even a single crack visible.
Gadfly’s eyes widened as he exclaimed, “How is this possible? Big Brother, your sword is unstoppable, how could it…”
Chen Ping didn’t respond, his expression growing solemn.
He swung the Dragon-Slaying Sword again, this time channelling even more power, the blade glowing brightly.
A thicker, more ferocious sword qi roared towards the stone wall.
Yet, the result was the same, the stone wall stood like an impregnable fortress, effortlessly withstanding the Dragon-Slaying Sword’s assault.
“It seems brute force alone won’t do,” Chen Ping said gravely, sheathing the Dragon-Slaying Sword, “There must be a formation core behind this stone wall. If we find the core and break the formation, the wall will naturally collapse.”
Gadfly scratched his head, saying helplessly, “But where is this core? The wall’s massive, we can’t just search every inch, can we?”
Chen Ping closed his eyes, circulating his spiritual energy to sense the surrounding energy fluctuations.
With the enhancement of the Heart-Calming Technique, his perception became extraordinarily sharp, detecting even the slightest changes in energy.
Moments later, his eyes snapped open, locking onto a corner on the right side of the stone wall.
The runes there seemed to flicker slightly faster than elsewhere, with faint signs of energy convergence.
“That’s likely it!” Chen Ping said, pointing to the corner.
Without hesitation, Gadfly rushed towards it.
He raised his fist and smashed it down on the spot.
But the moment his fist made contact, a powerful repulsive force surged back, sending him flying and crashing heavily onto the ground.
“Be careful! The core has strong defences,” Chen Ping warned, hurrying to help Gadfly up.
The two began cautiously probing around the core, searching for a way to break it.
Chen Ping pulled out several spirit stones from his robes, arranging them in a specific pattern to disrupt the core’s energy flow with their power.
As soon as the spirit stones were placed, the runes at the core glowed even brighter, and a powerful repulsive force surged towards them.
Chen Ping immediately channelled his spiritual energy, forming a protective shield in front of them to block the force.
Gritting his teeth, he continuously adjusted the positions and sequence of the spirit stones.
Finally, after several attempts, the runes’ glow at the core became erratic, and the stone wall began to tremble slightly.
With a violent shudder, the stone wall collapsed, revealing the scene behind it.
Chen Ping and Gadfly’s eyes widened, stunned by what they saw.
Before them lay a vein of immortal stones shimmering with golden light, the stones varying in size.
Each one radiated dense immortal qi, the combined aura a thousand times richer than outside.
The immortal stone vein twisted and stretched into the distance, seemingly endless.
“We’re rich! Big Brother, we’re truly rich!” Gadfly shouted, leaping with excitement, his face alight with ecstasy.
He eagerly tried to rush forward to collect the stones but was pulled back by Chen Ping.
“Careful, a treasure like this immortal stone vein is bound to have a guardian,” Chen Ping said, scanning their surroundings warily.
At that moment, an eerie laugh echoed from the depths of the vein, “Two reckless ants, daring to covet this king’s immortal stone vein!”
With the laughter, a horde of demons surged out from the depths of the vein.
