“Kid, there’s something odd about that token, haven’t you noticed?”
At that moment, the Red Cloud Demon Lord’s voice rang out!
“Odd? What’s odd about it?”
Chen Ping, puzzled, took out the token he had stored away!
The token felt cold in his hand, with the character ‘Underworld’ on it, but Chen Ping couldn’t spot anything unusual!
The Red Cloud Demon Lord let out a cold snort, his soul surging in Chen Ping’s sea of consciousness, “Your spiritual sense is still too shallow, this token’s surface is just a façade! If it were an ordinary token, why would it make even a wisp of my soul faintly tremble?”
Chen Ping’s expression grew serious, and he turned the token over, examining it closely, yet still found no clues.
“Open the Heavenly Underworld Eye!”
The Red Cloud Demon Lord suddenly barked, “You need to be more thorough in the future!”
Chen Ping’s heart jolted, knowing the Red Cloud Demon Lord must have sensed something different about the token, so he activated the Heavenly Underworld Eye, an eye appearing on his forehead, and the world before him turned a misty grey.
Under the gaze of the Heavenly Underworld Eye, the black mist on the token’s surface writhed like a living thing.
The previously smooth ‘Underworld’ character suddenly sank, revealing two tiny seal characters beneath: ‘Heaven’s Arrival’!
These two characters emitted a warm, lustrous glow, starkly different from the chilling aura of the rest of the token.
Chen Ping sucked in a sharp breath, looking at the Red Cloud Demon Lord in his sea of consciousness, “Senior, this…”
“As I suspected!”
The Red Cloud Demon Lord’s soul quaked violently, “Heaven’s Arrival Mansion, one of the most mysterious entities of ancient times!” “Legend has it they could traverse myriad realms, seeking out cultivators with great destiny.”
“Back then, several Dao Ancestors of the Celestial Realm were guided by Heaven’s Arrival Mansion! But ten thousand years ago, this organisation vanished without a trace, along with the great sect behind it, as if it never existed!”
Chen Ping frowned, unsure how this mysterious organisation was linked to Heaven’s Arrival Mansion, or why this token bore traces of it, especially since Heaven’s Arrival Mansion had long disappeared.
“Sect Leader Yun, have you heard of Heaven’s Arrival Mansion?” Chen Ping asked Yun Wuya.
Upon hearing the words ‘Heaven’s Arrival Mansion,’ Yun Wuya’s weapon clattered to the ground.
His face paled, his voice trembling, “Mr. Chen, Heaven’s Arrival Mansion… that’s a place that exists only in legends.”
“It’s said their criteria for selecting disciples defy the Celestial Realm’s heavenly laws!”
“Once, a rogue cultivator, merely a first-grade Loose Immortal, was taken by Heaven’s Arrival Mansion due to bearing a rare heaven-and-earth spiritual root.”
“Three days later, he returned, having directly broken through to the Earth Immortal Realm, slaughtering all his enemies in the Third Heaven before vanishing again!”
“That legend has been passed down for ages…”
“Three days to advance a major realm?” Chen Ping was speechless!
This bloody cultivation speed was even more absurd than his own!
“Could Heaven’s Arrival Mansion manipulate time rules, where three days in others’ eyes might be three years within the mansion?” Chen Ping’s heart leapt!
Such a freakish cultivation speed could only be explained this way.
With ample resources, Chen Ping could also advance a major realm in three years!
Training in the Demon-Suppressing Tower, three days equated to a year!
Hu Mazi, who had crept closer at some point, stared wide-eyed, “Bloody hell, that’s insane! If we could enter Heaven’s Arrival Mansion, wouldn’t we all soar to the heavens?”
“Master Hu, you’ve never heard of Heaven’s Arrival Mansion?” Chen Ping asked!
“Nope, I’ve been through so many reincarnations, how would I know about this?” Hu Mazi gave an awkward smile!
Chen Ping furrowed his brow in thought, putting the token away, “For now, let’s set aside the connection between Heaven’s Arrival Mansion and this mysterious organisation, the priority is dealing with the Seven Halls.”
