“Bloody hell, this dark?”
Chen Ping couldn’t help but swear upon hearing it.
The woman, however, let out a cold snort, glaring at Chen Ping as if she wanted to devour him.
“Kid’s just ignorant, don’t stoop to his level…”
Seeing this, Bai Yi hurriedly apologised to the woman.
Then, Bai Yi pulled Chen Ping aside and whispered, “It’s easy to deal with the big shots, but the small fries are tricky. Don’t clash with the staff in the future, or they’ll make your life hell, and you might not make it out of that purgatory.”
“Got it…”
Chen Ping nodded.
What difference was there between this heavenly realm and the mortal world? Even the women working here were cut from the same cloth…
All high and mighty, acting like someone owed them money.
“Go in, stay safe. If you feel you can’t handle it, don’t push yourself, just get out immediately.”
Bai Yi cautioned Chen Ping, worried he might overdo it.
“I know!” Chen Ping replied, then headed towards the steps.
Eighteen thousand steps, stretching endlessly, especially when you were in the midst of them. Chen Ping felt like he was walking on a boundless road, flanked by bottomless cliffs.
Seeing Chen Ping start the climb, Bai Yi thought about leaving but then changed his mind, deciding to wait for him instead.
If something happened to Chen Ping, Bai Yi could at least help on the spot. If Chen Ping got into trouble and Bai Qian came to the heavenly realm, she might not even acknowledge her own father.
Chen Ping walked step by step. For someone like him, with a sturdy body and ample strength, these steps posed no real challenge.
Climbing them was all about endurance, and endurance was something Chen Ping had in spades.
Every step of his journey had been about gritting his teeth and pushing through.
When Chen Ping finally reached the entrance of the massive cave, he took a moment to catch his breath.
Then he took out the trial crystal and tossed it into the cave.
Buzz!
A white light flashed inside the cave, and Chen Ping felt as if he were being sucked away by some force.
When he opened his eyes, he found himself in a desolate wasteland, surrounded by dark red hues, littered with skeletal remains. The sky was drizzling lightly.
Chen Ping touched his face and realised it wasn’t rain, but blood. The sky was raining blood.
Looking around, there was no sign of the cave, as if he’d been transported to another world.
Chen Ping’s expression grew grim. This damn place was downright eerie.
He began to channel the Heart Condensation Technique, absorbing the sinister energy of the world around him. The place was thick with it, like a slice of hell.
The sinister energy surged into Chen Ping’s body like a tidal wave.
Fortunately, his Heart Condensation Technique could refine anything, converting any energy into his own.
With his demonic bloodline, as the sinister energy poured into him, Chen Ping felt his body brimming with power, and the tension he’d felt earlier vanished completely.
“This is actually a great place…”
Chen Ping slowly closed his eyes, eagerly absorbing the surrounding sinister energy.
As the massive influx of energy entered his body, his face darkened, and the veins on his body began to bulge.
“Lad, the sinister energy is good, but don’t get careless, or you might lose control and go mad.”
“This place has plenty of malevolent spirits. It looks like a great battle happened here, and the souls of the dead are trapped, unable to escape.”
Just as Chen Ping was gleefully absorbing the sinister energy, the Crimson Cloud Demon Lord’s voice rang out, warning him.
