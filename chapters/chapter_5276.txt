The second round of the competition was held three days later.
After the first round’s elimination, the remaining contestants were all elite disciples from various sects, their strength a level above the previous round.
Chen Ping’s opponent was a disciple from the Blazing Fire Sect named Zhang Kuang, with a fourth-grade Earth Immortal realm cultivation. His “Blazing Fire Sword Technique” was mastered to perfection, each sword strike carrying scorching heat waves, said to be capable of melting refined iron.
“Boy, making it to the second round was your luck, but meeting me, your good fortune ends here!”
Zhang Kuang wielded a crimson long sword, its blade faintly wreathed in flames, clearly a treasure infused with fire-attribute spiritual energy.
Chen Ping maintained his calm demeanour, slowly drawing the Dragon-Slaying Sword.
As the sword left its sheath, there was no earth-shaking sword cry, only a faint hum, like a slumbering dragon awakening.
But Hu Mazi, familiar with the Dragon-Slaying Sword, knew the terrifying power contained within that seemingly ordinary hum.
“Oh? Finally willing to draw your sword?”
Zhang Kuang’s lips curled into a cold sneer. “Too bad, your sword will only turn to scrap metal before mine!”
Before his words faded, he slashed out, the crimson sword light like a fire dragon surging forth, carrying rolling heat waves toward Chen Ping.
The crowd below felt a scorching wave hit them, and many lower-cultivation practitioners instinctively stepped back.
“Such intense fire! This ‘Blazing Fire Sword Technique’ lives up to its name!”
“That Chen Ping is in trouble. A Loose Immortal’s spiritual energy can’t withstand this flame’s burn!”
Facing this powerful strike, Chen Ping advanced instead of retreating.
With a slight flick of his wrist, the Dragon-Slaying Sword traced a strange arc in the air, like an antelope’s horns, leaving no trace to follow.
Where the sword light passed, the seemingly ferocious fire dragon, as if meeting its nemesis, dissipated almost entirely.
“What?”
Zhang Kuang was stunned. He had never seen anyone neutralize his “Blazing Fire Sword Technique” so effortlessly.
Before he could react, Chen Ping’s sword struck like a venomous snake, aiming for his wrist.
The angle of this strike was so precise, impossible to evade.
Zhang Kuang could only abandon his sword, his left hand forming a fist, infused with scorching spiritual energy, smashing toward Chen Ping’s chest.
Knowing his swordsmanship was inferior, he aimed to overpower with cultivation.
A cold glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes. His body spun like a top, dodging the fist while the Dragon-Slaying Sword swept horizontally.
“Swish!”
The sword light flashed, neatly slicing Zhang Kuang’s sleeve, leaving a bloody mark on his arm.
Had he not retreated quickly, that strike might have crippled his entire arm.
Shocked and enraged, Zhang Kuang clutched his wound and stepped back, eyeing Chen Ping with wariness. “You… what kind of swordsmanship is that?”
Chen Ping did not answer, merely standing with his sword, saying lightly, “Care to continue?”
Zhang Kuang looked at the seemingly ordinary iron sword in Chen Ping’s hand, then at the wound on his arm, and finally gritted his teeth. “I concede!”
With that, he picked up his fallen sword and left the stage in embarrassment.
The crowd erupted into deafening cheers.
“Another one-strike victory! This Chen Ping is too strong!”
“A Loose Immortal eighth-grade defeating an Earth Immortal fourth-grade, that’s simply heaven-defying!”
“I’m starting to believe he could make it to the end!”
On the VIP platform, Qin Lie’s brows furrowed tighter. He said to Zhao Jingfeng beside him, “Chen Ping’s swordsmanship is peculiar. It seems ordinary but always breaks brute force with finesse. Don’t underestimate him if you face him.”
Zhao Jingfeng scoffed, “Sect Leader, don’t worry. It’s just some opportunistic tricks. In a head-on clash, he wouldn’t withstand a single strike of mine.”
“This kid isn’t just skilled in swordsmanship; his sword intent is formidable too. I’ve experienced it myself…”
“You must not be careless, or you might end up overturned in the gutter…”
Qin Feng looked at Chen Ping, recalling the time at the city gate when he and Ling Xue were testing sword intent. Chen Ping’s surge of sword intent had forced them apart.
