A barely perceptible glint of greed flashed in the mysterious old man’s eyes as he chuckled, “Good, good…”
With a wave of his hand, the mysterious old man sent Chen Ping instantly into the chaotic space.
The old man still looked at Chen Ping with a beaming smile, “Young one, your aptitude is impressive. I can make you step directly into the Earth Immortal Realm.”
Chen Ping feigned excitement, “Many thanks, Senior!”
The old man raised his hand and placed it on Chen Ping’s head, a soft glow instantly enveloping Chen Ping’s entire body.
“Come, let me enhance your cultivation…”
The old man’s voice suddenly turned sinister, his palm transforming into a pitch-black vortex, frantically devouring Chen Ping’s life force!
However, just as he thought he had succeeded.
“Heart Condensation Technique!”
Chen Ping abruptly opened his eyes, the Heart Condensation Technique surging wildly within him, reversing the absorption and devouring the old man’s power!
“What?” The old man was horrified, trying to pull his hand back, only to find his spiritual body firmly locked in place!
“Old fool, you may deceive others, but not me!” Chen Ping sneered, “Using the promise of realm advancement as bait, while actually draining others’ lifespan to possess their body, huh?”
“You… how do you know the Ancient Divine Technique?” The old man was utterly terrified, his spiritual body trembling violently.
“Too bad, you picked the wrong target.” A cold glint flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes, “Your cultivation is now mine!”
Boom…!
A ferocious devouring force erupted, and the old man’s spiritual body withered at a visible rate!
“No!!!”
Amidst the old man’s piercing screams, his spiritual body completely shattered, turning into pure energy that surged into Chen Ping’s body!
Chen Ping’s realm began to rise, reaching the third rank of the Loose Immortal Realm in the blink of an eye.
Feeling his realm elevate and his strength soar, Chen Ping couldn’t be happier.
Now, he no longer needed to bow and scrape. If Tianci dared to talk too much, Chen Ping could slap him outright.
At the third rank of the Loose Immortal Realm, Chen Ping could fearlessly face off against someone at the eighth rank.
…
When Chen Ping returned alone from the chaotic space, everyone was stunned.
“Where’s the Senior?” Tianci hurriedly asked.
Chen Ping coldly glanced at him, “What Senior? That was just an old ghost clinging to life by devouring others’ lifespans!”
“What?!” Everyone’s faces changed drastically.
“You’re lying!” Tianci roared, “My realm clearly improved, and didn’t yours as well?”
“Indeed, it improved, but check how much lifespan you have left,” Chen Ping scoffed.
Tianci froze, quickly inspecting himself, and his face turned ashen—
His lifespan was down to less than ten years!
“No… this can’t be!” He shook his head frantically, unwilling to believe it.
The white-robed woman, Elder Tong, and the others also checked themselves, their faces turning deathly pale.
“We… were deceived…”
Mo Qingyun, still shaken, grabbed Chen Ping’s hand, “Thank goodness you figured it out…”
Chen Ping nodded, his gaze shifting to the three coffins, “This relic of the Gantian Sect is nothing but a trap!”
“That old thing sustained his spiritual body by devouring the lifespans of intruders, waiting for a chance to resurrect.”
Chen Ping explained!
Though some were skeptical, they could feel the loss of their life force.
As mere loose cultivators, they didn’t have limitless lifespans.
If their lifespans ran out and their realms couldn’t advance further, they would wither and die.
“Ah…!”
Tianci, like a madman, attacked the coffin in front of him.
Except for the middle coffin, which was smashed to pieces, the other two remained untouched, their mysterious runes continuously flowing.
Chen Ping looked at the two coffins and decided to open them to see if there was anything valuable inside.
He couldn’t leave empty-handed after coming all this way, could he?
Chen Ping crouched down and began studying the mysterious runes on the coffins.
Seeing Chen Ping study the runes, Elder Tong snorted, “What do you know about them?”
