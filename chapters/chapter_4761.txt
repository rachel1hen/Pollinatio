Chen Ping glanced at Lin Kefan and smiled faintly. “Watch closely. I’ll show you how to destroy the Tenth Hall.”
As soon as Chen Ping finished speaking, the Dragon-Slaying Sword in his hand vanished, replaced by a divine bow.
The Divine King’s Bow appeared in Chen Ping’s hand!
It was rare for Chen Ping to reveal the Divine King’s Bow, as he feared it might attract unwanted attention and put him in danger.
After all, as the saying goes, “A common man’s possession of a treasure is his crime.” But now, Chen Ping was powerful enough to dominate the Heavenly Realm, so he no longer feared anyone coveting his Divine King’s Bow.
As the Divine King’s Bow appeared, the atmosphere in the hall instantly became tense to the extreme.
The bow glowed with a faint blue light, as if it contained the power of the stars. Every flicker of light sent shivers down everyone’s spines.
Seeing the Divine King’s Bow in Chen Ping’s hand, everyone was shocked. Xuan Bin and the others quickly stepped back, afraid of being injured by the bow’s power.
“The Divine King’s Bow? You actually possess such a divine artifact!”
The Tenth Hall Master’s voice was filled with disbelief and awe. He knew the reputation of the Divine King’s Bow—a weapon capable of slaying gods and demons.
Chen Ping gripped the Divine King’s Bow tightly, his eyes blazing like torches. The power within him seemed to boil over at this moment.
He took a deep breath, adjusted his stance, and prepared to unleash a fatal strike.
“Today, I’ll let you witness the power of the Divine King’s Bow!”
Chen Ping roared, channeling all his strength into his right hand as he drew the bowstring. The air seemed to freeze in place.
Seeing this, the Tenth Hall Master didn’t dare to be careless. He quickly gathered all his spiritual energy to form a thick protective shield, enveloping himself completely.
He knew that this arrow was no joke. The slightest mistake could lead to his utter destruction.
“Whoosh—”
A dazzling blue light streaked across the sky, accompanied by a deafening sonic boom, heading straight for the Tenth Hall Master’s shield.
Where the arrow passed, space itself seemed to tear apart, leaving behind shocking cracks.
“Boom!”
The arrow collided with the shield, producing an earth-shattering explosion.
Under the impact of the arrow, the shield began to tremble violently, ripples spreading across its surface.
The Tenth Hall Master’s face turned pale. He never expected the Divine King’s Bow to be so terrifying.
He poured all his strength into maintaining the shield, but the overwhelming force continued to erode it, putting him under unprecedented pressure.
“Again!”
Chen Ping didn’t give the Tenth Hall Master a chance to catch his breath. He drew the bowstring once more, preparing to fire a second arrow.
This time, he poured almost all his strength into the shot. The blue light on the arrow became even more dazzling, as if it could illuminate the entire hall.
“No!”
The Tenth Hall Master screamed in terror, knowing he couldn’t withstand another attack like this.
But the arrow was already on its way. He could only fight desperately, channeling all his spiritual energy into his fists to block the arrow.
“Boom!”
The arrow collided with the Tenth Hall Master’s fists, unleashing a force that shook heaven and earth.
This time, the shield finally couldn’t hold and shattered with a deafening crash.
The Tenth Hall Master was sent flying by the terrifying force, tumbling through the air several times before crashing heavily to the ground.
When he struggled to his feet, he saw that his right arm was mangled and bloody, clearly injured by the arrow’s residual power.
His face was filled with shock and fear. Being so thoroughly defeated by a cultivator at the Second Level of the Great Ascension Realm was something he had never imagined.
Just as the Tenth Hall Master was reeling from the shock, Chen Ping drew the bow again. But this time, he wasn’t aiming at the Tenth Hall Master.
This time, he fired over a dozen arrows!
Every cultivator of the Tenth Hall was targeted by an arrow, especially the Tenth Hall’s Young Master, who was marked by three arrows.
Chen Ping had promised Yun Li that he wouldn’t kill the Tenth Hall Master. It was a promise he intended to keep.
But Chen Ping had never promised not to kill Yun Li’s younger brother, the Tenth Hall’s Young Master!
