Dozens of figures shrouded in black mist surged out of the abyss, led by none other than Ming Shao.
He stood atop a warship made of white bones, with four coffins exuding a terrifying aura trailing behind him.
“Emperor Lin, impressive skills, but alas…” Ming Shao sneered darkly, “you’ve fallen into my trap!”
Ming Shao had never taken Chen Ping seriously; in his eyes, the real threat was Lin Chong!
The Emperor of Sun-Moon City, leader of the third-ranked power in the Celestial Realm—that wasn’t just empty talk!
Lin Chong’s strength was formidable, which made Ming Shao wary.
But now, after two intense battles, Lin Chong was clearly at the end of his rope!
“Despicable wretch. Compared to your father, all you’re good at is posturing—nothing more,” Lin Chong spat, glaring at Ming Shao with fury.
“Whatever you say now, it’s too late…”
Ming Shao’s face twisted into a cold smirk.
With a wave of his skull sceptre, the four coffins burst open with a thunderous bang.
A towering wave of sinister energy shot into the sky as four mummified corpses clad in nether armour slowly rose, their hollow eye sockets flickering with eerie green phosphorescent flames.
“Nether Corpses?” Lin Chong’s pupils shrank. “The Four Nether Prefectures dare to summon ancient nether corpses?”
“Jie jie jie, Emperor Lin, what keen eyes,” Ming Shao said, pointing his sceptre at Chen Ping. “Today, not only will your Sun-Moon City fall, but I’m taking this little Chen Ping’s head as well!”
“I’ll teach him a lesson: in the Celestial Realm, I’m the only one allowed to show off…”
The four nether corpses suddenly lunged forward, leaving trails of frost in the void wherever they passed.
Lin Chong’s surrounding yang flames flared, but the moment they clashed with the nether corpses, their power was suppressed by a third.
Even more horrifying, each corpse harboured hundreds of sealed resentful spirits within. Their piercing wails instantly caused the ears of everyone fighting to throb with pain.
Chen Ping forced himself to stand, the Divine King Bow humming incessantly in his hand.
But as he tried to draw the string, a sharp pain stabbed through his chest.
He dropped to one knee, his face pale as paper, beads of sweat the size of beans rolling down his forehead.
The cost of overusing the Divine King Bow had caught up with him. A divine weapon like this, if mishandled, would backlash!
At this moment, though the bow was in his grasp, the chaos in his spiritual energy rendered it nearly powerless.
Gritting his teeth, he tried to force his spiritual energy to circulate, but it only churned his chest like a stormy sea, nearly forcing a mouthful of blood out.
Seeing this, Lin Chong’s heart tightened, and he stole a glance at Chen Ping.
At that exact moment, a nether corpse seized the opening, swinging its withered arm glowing with green light and smashing it towards Lin Chong.
Lin Chong dodged to the side in a flash, but the chilling yin energy still grazed his shoulder. His clothes instantly frosted over, and his skin took on a purplish hue.
“Hmph, Emperor Lin, today is your end!”
Ming Shao cackled triumphantly from atop the bone warship.
His skull sceptre waved even faster, directing the four nether corpses and dozens of skeletal warriors to surround Lin Chong and Chen Ping completely.
Lin Chong took a deep breath, the radiance of his Sun-Moon Golden Rainbow Technique surging once more as he tried to break through the encirclement.
His hands flew through a rapid series of seals, and the nine Golden Crow phantoms behind him blazed with light.
Each Golden Crow let out a resounding cry, their searing yang flames crashing like relentless waves, battering the surrounding sinister energy.
“Sun-Moon Cycle, Heaven and Earth Tremble!”
With a furious shout, Lin Chong unleashed a golden pillar of light infused with boundless yang energy that soared into the sky, enveloping one of the nether corpses.
The corpse howled in agony within the yang flames, its nether armour melting away as the resentful spirits sealed inside broke free, only to vanish into nothingness under the blaze.
Yet, as Lin Chong’s old strength waned and new strength had yet to rise, the other three nether corpses struck simultaneously.
Their black spears, bone blades, and iron chains, wrapped in rolling yin chill, attacked Lin Chong from different angles.
Lin Chong’s eyes sharpened, his figure flickering like a phantom as he evaded the onslaught amidst the perilous chaos.
While Lin Chong drew the bulk of the enemies’ attention, Chen Ping endured the excruciating pain in his body, sitting cross-legged to recover as quickly as possible.
He fully activated the Heart-Calming Technique, frantically absorbing the surrounding sinister energy. This not only aided his recovery but also helped ease some of the pressure on Lin Chong!
