Tianci is the pride of their Tianyuan Pavilion, capable of fighting above his level. If something really happened to him, how would he explain it when he returned?
At this moment, Tianci was with a mysterious old man in a chaotic void.
“Your strength is too weak, just a mere Minor Immortal. I’ll directly elevate you to the Earth Immortal realm. Go and make a name for yourself in the Fourth Heaven,” the mysterious old man said to Tianci.
Upon hearing this, Tianci was so excited he nearly cried, kneeling on the ground, practically willing to lick the old man’s toes.
“Thank you, Senior, thank you, Senior…” Tianci kowtowed repeatedly.
The mysterious old man gently placed his palm on Tianci’s head, and waves of soft light enveloped him.
Tianci felt his body trembling violently, as if it were being torn apart, nearly falling apart.
He gritted his teeth and endured, collapsing to the ground drenched in sweat.
“Your talent is decent, but your physical body is too weak. You could only handle advancing to the fifth rank of the Minor Immortal realm,” the mysterious old man said, shaking his head.
Tianci felt a pang of disappointment, but reaching the fifth rank of the Minor Immortal realm was still impressive. With his ability to fight above his level, he could take on someone at the seventh rank.
“Thank you, Senior…” Tianci knelt and kowtowed again.
With a wave of the mysterious old man’s hand, their figures reappeared before the crowd, and everyone’s eyes widened.
“Fifth rank of the Minor Immortal realm?!”
“How long has it been, and he’s advanced two ranks?!”
Elder Tong trembled with excitement, hurrying forward to check Tianci’s condition.
Tianci stood proudly, feeling the surging power within him, smirking at Chen Ping, “Hmph, do you still dare to act arrogant in front of me now?”
Chen Ping frowned slightly, ignoring Tianci’s provocation, and instead observed him closely.
Something was off…
Tianci’s realm had indeed advanced, but his entire being exuded a strange sense of decay, as if part of his vitality had been drained.
“Senior, I also want to advance my strength!” The white-robed woman knelt eagerly, her eyes filled with longing.
“Good, good…” The mysterious old man nodded with a smile, waving his hand and disappearing with her.
Moments later, the white-robed woman returned, her realm similarly skyrocketing!
“Hahaha! I’ve broken through!” she laughed excitedly, though her laughter carried a hint of hoarseness, as if she had aged slightly.
Next, Elder Tong and three black-robed elders stepped forward, requesting the mysterious old man’s guidance.
The mysterious old man accepted all, boosting their realms one by one.
Soon, everyone was immersed in the joy of their skyrocketing strength, except Chen Ping, who grew increasingly alarmed.
Though their realms had advanced, their vitality was rapidly draining!
At this rate, despite their increased realms, they wouldn’t live long, and their future cultivation would likely stall.
“Chen Ping, let’s go too!” Mo Qingyun tugged at Chen Ping’s sleeve, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.
“No way!” Chen Ping grabbed her, whispering, “There’s something wrong with this old guy!”
“Huh?” Mo Qingyun was stunned. “But they’ve all advanced…”
“They’ve advanced, but at the cost of their lifespan!” Chen Ping said gravely. “Haven’t you noticed? Their vitality is clearly fading!”
Mo Qingyun shook her head; she couldn’t sense vitality, only that everyone’s realms had risen.
“Then… what do we do?” Mo Qingyun panicked.
Chen Ping narrowed his eyes, a faint smile forming. “Since he wants to play, I’ll play along.”
With that, he stepped forward, respectfully cupping his hands to the mysterious old man. “Senior, this junior believes he has great talent, versatility, exceptional gifts, and a drive to improve. I humbly request that Senior pass the mantle of Gantian Sect to me.”
“If I receive the Gantian Sect’s mantle and advance my realm, I’ll burn incense and pray for Senior every day.”
