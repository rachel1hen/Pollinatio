Li Chunfeng, standing nearby, looked thoroughly embarrassed and ashamed!
“So why were you imprisoned? Tell me the truth, and I’ll help you break the seal.”
Chen Ping asked curiously!
“I… I… I just accidentally touched a female immortal’s backside, and who knew her father was a Golden Immortal? That’s why he locked me up here!”
The scholar said, his voice tinged with guilt!
His words grew quieter, and it was obvious it was no accident!
Chen Ping held back a laugh, glancing at Li Chunfeng. It seemed they’d offended the same female immortal!
“I’ll break your seal, and you serve me for three hundred years, how’s that?”
Chen Ping asked!
“Fine, but when you break the seal and face the heavenly tribulation, if you die, don’t expect me to care!”
The scholar replied!
“Don’t worry, a mere Golden Immortal’s tribulation? I don’t even take it seriously!”
With that, Chen Ping slammed his palm onto the palace floor!
A glow slowly rose from the ground, and the imprisonment seal gradually appeared, just like those of Nan Batian and Li Chunfeng, with red blood flowing within!
But just as Chen Ping was about to break it, the seal trembled and vanished!
The scholar froze, then moved his body, his face full of shock!
“The seal’s gone…”
The scholar said.
Chen Ping stood there, dumbfounded, “How’d it run off?”
“Mr. Chen, it must be that the seal was scared of you, so the moment you acted, it fled!”
Li Chunfeng hurriedly explained!
“Don’t talk nonsense, that seal’s just a mark, it doesn’t have a mind of its own, how could it run away?”
“It must be the one who set the seal, pulling it back suddenly.”
“Could it be, friend, that you have some connection with the Golden Immortal who imprisoned me?”
The scholar asked Chen Ping curiously!
Chen Ping shook his head. How could he have any ties with a Golden Immortal? He didn’t even know them!
“Senior, you’re free now, don’t forget your promise!” Chen Ping said!
“Of course, since I’ve agreed, I’ll definitely serve you for three hundred years.”
“But you’d better prepare for the coming tribulation. We’ll talk more once you’ve survived it!”
The scholar reminded Chen Ping!
The scholar reminded Chen Ping!
“You two, step back, don’t get caught up in this!”
With two prior experiences, Chen Ping felt much more at ease!
If the Little Heaven-Devouring Beast didn’t show, he’d use the Dragon Pattern Bell to resist.
Chen Ping took a deep breath, his body shrouded in the Indestructible Golden Body, the Dragon Pattern Bell at the ready!
With everything prepared, Chen Ping waited calmly!
Soon, a vast force descended from the heavens!
“Mr. Chen, watch out, the tribulation’s here…”
Li Chunfeng warned Chen Ping!
Chen Ping nodded, gathering all his power into one spot, forming layer upon layer of shields around himself!
Clang…
Just as Chen Ping braced for the impact, a crisp sound rang out!
It was as if a hammer had tapped him lightly on the head!
After the sound, that immense heavenly force dissipated instantly!
Li Chunfeng: “…”
The scholar: “…”
Chen Ping: “…”
The three of them froze like statues, none moving or speaking!
They couldn’t understand, since when had heavenly tribulations become like this?
It didn’t even have the force of an ordinary person throwing a big rock!
Was this the power of a Golden Immortal’s heavenly law?
Chen Ping couldn’t figure out what was going on either!
He didn’t know someone was going easy on him!
Though, they might’ve gone a bit *too* easy!
“I told you, a mere Golden Immortal’s nothing to me…”
Chen Ping retracted his various abilities, striking a smug pose as he spoke!
The scholar and Li Chunfeng stared at him with pure admiration!
How long had he been cultivating? What realm was he even at?
Compared to Chen Ping, these immortals who’d cultivated for tens of thousands of years felt like they should crawl into a rat hole and hide!
