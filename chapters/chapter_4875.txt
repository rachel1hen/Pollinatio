As Chen Ping stepped into the palace, he immediately spotted Ning Zhi, draped in a fiery red cloak and wearing a mask!
Beside him, another female cultivator in similar attire wielded a flaming longsword, her expression cold as she stared into the darkness of the palace!
Ning Zhi noticed Chen Ping too, and seeing him reach the fourth level, his expression subtly shifted!
“Brother Ning, you’ve made it to the fourth level already.”
Chen Ping took the initiative to greet Ning Zhi!
Ning Zhi nodded, but when he saw Li Chunfeng and Shen Zhiyan trailing behind Chen Ping, his face changed dramatically!
He recognised Shen Zhiyan, having just passed the third level—this was the third-level guardian!
Now, seeing him follow Chen Ping to the fourth level, it meant the third-level guardian had become Chen Ping’s ally!
Ning Zhi didn’t know what to think anymore!
“Your senior sister…” Chen Ping glanced at Su Yuqi’s back and asked softly!
“She’s challenging…”
Ning Zhi replied!
No sooner had he spoken than a sword light appeared out of nowhere in front of Su Yuqi!
The strike came from the darkness, impossible to tell who had unleashed it!
This sword aimed straight for Su Yuqi’s face, a killing blow from the start!
Su Yuqi reacted swiftly, swinging her own sword the moment the light appeared!
Bang!
The sword light shattered under Su Yuqi’s strike, and without hesitation, she swept her longsword in a wide arc!
The entire hall was instantly engulfed in flames, the once-dark space now illuminated by the blaze!
A figure stood amidst the fire, their features obscured!
“Supreme Fire, the Demon Clan’s Supreme Fire?” Chen Ping felt the roaring flames, his brow furrowing as he glanced at Ning Zhi!
“We’re demon cultivators, Brother Chen, you won’t look down on us, will you?”
Ning Zhi asked Chen Ping!
“No…” Chen Ping shook his head, saying nothing more!
At that moment, from within the raging flames, sword lights shot out one after another, as if the fire posed no threat to the opponent!
Su Yuqi wielded her longsword, deftly parrying the dazzling sword strikes!
Bang!
When the final sword light was deflected, Su Yuqi’s longsword snapped in two!
Seeing her weapon break, Su Yuqi’s eyes narrowed, and she slammed both palms downward!
Boom!
Endless Supreme Fire erupted around her, and within it, a sword forged from the flames slowly took shape!
Just then, more sword lights shot toward her, but they were all blocked by the Supreme Fire surrounding her!
If Su Yuqi had reacted any slower, those sword lights would’ve pierced her body!
With a furious shout, Su Yuqi gripped the flame-forged sword with her right hand and swung it fiercely!
Thousands of fiery sword lights surged forth!
This time, the opponent didn’t counter. With a casual wave of their hand, Su Yuqi’s thousands of fiery sword lights extinguished instantly, along with all the Supreme Fire in the hall!
The palace plunged back into darkness, and Su Yuqi, as if struck by a heavy blow, was sent flying, crashing hard to the ground!
“Your senior sister lost…”
Chen Ping said to Ning Zhi!
But seeing Su Yuqi defeated, Chen Ping felt an unease in his chest, an urge to avenge her!
He didn’t know why.
Maybe it was his sense of justice, unwilling to see a woman bullied?
Su Yuqi struggled to her feet and swung her sword again!
She refused to admit defeat!
With this strike, the very void trembled!
Suddenly, the palace lit up brightly, and a black-robed man reached out with a gentle grasp!
The heavens shook violently, Su Yuqi’s body froze as if bound, and the flame-forged sword in her hand vanished in an instant!
