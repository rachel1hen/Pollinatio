As Chen Ping approached the town, more than a dozen cultivators suddenly appeared, armed with weapons, surrounding him!
Leading them was an old man dressed in a Taoist robe, clearly a Taoist priest!
With a quick glance, Chen Ping noted their strength was only at the Fusion Realm. The old man, the strongest among them, was merely at the eighth level of the Fusion Realm!
To Chen Ping now, the Fusion Realm was less than an ant!
“Fellow cultivator, where are you from? What brings you to our town?”
The old man cautiously eyed Chen Ping and asked!
“I’m from the Heavenly Human Realm, and I’m here to…”
Before Chen Ping could finish, the group’s faces filled with terror, and they turned to flee back into the town!
The old man led the charge, shouting loudly, “The heavenly calamity has begun! Activate the formation now…”
As the surrounding formation sprang to life, the entire town was enveloped in a glowing light!
Many townsfolk stared at Chen Ping in horror!
Chen Ping was utterly confused. Why were these people so afraid of him?
He walked step by step toward the town, pressing his palm lightly against the glowing barrier. In an instant, the formation around the town shattered!
Just like that, Chen Ping strolled easily into the town!
But this sent the townspeople into a complete panic.
Women’s cries and children’s screams rang out as if it were the end of the world!
“Old sir, what are you all doing? I’m not some demon. Why are you so scared of me?”
Chen Ping asked the old man, utterly baffled!
The old man looked at Chen Ping nervously before speaking, “Aren’t you here to steal resources and kill people?”
“Of course not. I have my own resources. Why would I rob you? Besides, you all look dirt poor. This world’s spiritual energy is so thin, what resources could there even be?”
Chen Ping said dismissively!
Hearing this, the old man’s eyes welled up with tears as he sobbed, “This world of ours used to be rich in spiritual energy, with abundant resources everywhere.”
“But three hundred years ago, powerful cultivators from other planar worlds suddenly descended, plundering our resources and slaughtering our cultivators.”
“Every hundred years, strong cultivators appear in our world, burning, killing, and looting. We call it the heavenly calamity.”
“Those people also said they were from the Heavenly Human Realm. When you just said you’re from there, I knew the calamity had started again.”
The old man spoke with deep sorrow. A world once brimming with resources had been reduced to this state, making it nearly impossible for its cultivators to grow strong!
“Only three hundred years?” Chen Ping frowned slightly!
If this world had only endured three hundred years of plunder, it proved it wasn’t the original world of the Heavenly Ladder’s first tier. It must have been swapped out!
Given the current state, if the Heavenly Ladder appeared again next time, the first tier’s world likely wouldn’t be this one anymore!
After three rounds of looting, this world had little left to offer.
“Who exactly is helping the Heavenly Human Realm’s cultivators?”
Chen Ping couldn’t figure it out. With countless worlds spécialisée
He wondered why someone would feed one world to another across the universe’s myriad realms!
What was happening now was like teleporting other planar worlds directly into this one via the Heavenly Ladder’s gates, not that this world was inherently part of the ladder!
“Old sir, since you’ve been through this three times, you must know we’re here to challenge someone, right?”
“As long as I succeed, I can leave your world.”
Chen Ping wanted to glean from the old man who he needed to challenge to get out of here!
Since he had to find it himself, someone must know. He couldn’t just guess and kill everyone in this world, could he?
“Of course I know. But you absolutely can’t go now. Stay here for a few days, then go challenge them!”
The old man warned Chen Ping!
