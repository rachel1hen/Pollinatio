Chen Ping did not pursue, as he was unsure if his strength could hold up in the Second Heaven Realm.
Could he handle the Tianyuan Pavilion?
With the Divine Hall as an enemy already, Chen Ping had no desire to make more foes.
“Are you also after those two coffins?”
Chen Ping asked, looking at the white-robed woman.
The white-robed woman gave Chen Ping a deep look, then glanced warily at the two warrior statues, before quietly retreating with the three black-robed elders.
Within the ruins, only Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun remained.
“Chen Ping, you’re… you’re incredible!” Mo Qingyun’s eyes were full of admiration, her face flushed with excitement.
Chen Ping, however, shook his head, his gaze fixed gravely on the two warrior statues, “The real trouble is just beginning.”
The warriors suddenly turned, their blood-red eyes locking onto Chen Ping, their weapons slightly raised, as if making some kind of judgement.
The runes on their bodies flickered, emitting a dangerous aura.
The sudden change in the two warrior statues made Chen Ping tense, pulling Mo Qingyun behind him.
“They, they don’t seem to be mere puppets…”
Chen Ping whispered, his hand already on his storage ring, ready to draw a weapon for any sudden situation.
At this tense moment, one of the warriors suddenly dropped to one knee, a hoarse voice emerging from its armour,
“We… are commanded by our master… to guard the inheritance…”
Chen Ping’s pupils contracted, his heart surging with shock.
These two warrior statues still retained consciousness! Who was this master they spoke of?
Could it be the mysterious old man whose essence he had absorbed?
Mo Qingyun nervously clutched Chen Ping’s sleeve, “They’re… they’re talking?”
The warrior slowly raised its head, its blood-red eyes fixed on Chen Ping, “Master…”
Before it could finish, the two warriors suddenly turned into two beams of black light, merging into Chen Ping’s body!
Chen Ping felt a flood of immense information rush into his mind, his vision darkening, nearly fainting.
“Chen Ping!”
Mo Qingyun quickly supported him, noticing a blood-red rune faintly appearing on his forehead.
When Chen Ping opened his eyes again, a flash of understanding crossed his gaze, “I see… these two warrior statues have mistaken me for their master…”
By using the Heart-Calming Technique to absorb the mysterious old man, Chen Ping had taken on his aura, which is why the warrior statues recognised him as their master.
The runes behind the two warrior statues felt strangely familiar to Chen Ping, and this was precisely why!
After the two warriors turned into black light and entered Chen Ping’s body, the entire ruin suddenly began to shake violently!
“Not good, the ruins are collapsing!”
Chen Ping looked up sharply, seeing cracks forming in the dome, countless stones falling.
He grabbed Mo Qingyun’s hand, “Let’s go!”
The two rushed towards the exit, the sound of collapse roaring behind them, the entire space as if torn apart by an invisible giant hand.
“Chen Ping, where’s the exit?” Mo Qingyun asked anxiously.
“Follow me!”
A golden light flashed in Chen Ping’s eyes, instantly locking onto a faint light source, the teleportation array they had used to enter!
However, the teleportation array was already disintegrating, its runes dimming, on the verge of failing.
“No time!”
Chen Ping gritted his teeth, pushing Mo Qingyun towards the teleportation array, “You go first!”
“What about you?” Mo Qingyun exclaimed.
“I’ll manage!”
Before his words faded, Chen Ping struck out with a palm, infusing spiritual energy into the teleportation array, forcibly activating its last bit of power.
Buzz,
A white light flashed, and Mo Qingyun’s figure vanished instantly.
Just as the teleportation array completely collapsed, Chen Ping leapt, diving into the closing spatial rift!
…
Cangxuan Continent, Floating Island.
The mysterious island, originally suspended high in the sky, was now trembling violently, countless cultivators looking up in panic.
“What’s happening? Why is the Floating Island shaking?”
“Heavens, it’s falling!”
