“You…” The Third Elder was left speechless by the retort.
“I won’t hold your Asura Hall accountable for injuring my elder. Take your people and leave immediately.”
“When your Hall Master emerges from seclusion, I will personally visit to demand an explanation.”
The Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion waved his hand and said!
The Third Elder’s face darkened, but he didn’t dare make another move. After all, he lacked the courage to act in the presence of the Tianyuan Pavilion Master.
Even if the other party was just a projection, the Third Elder had no desire to spark a war between the Asura Hall and Tianyuan Pavilion!
“Since you’ve been spreading rumours about me everywhere, I can’t let you live!”
Chen Ping stepped forward slowly.
The Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion sized up Chen Ping, smiling faintly, “Truly young and promising, and I hear you can even fight above your level.”
“Are you interested in joining our Tianyuan Pavilion? I can grant you the title of Heavenly Prodigy, with endless resources at your disposal!”
The Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion was actually trying to recruit Chen Ping.
“You’re not worthy…”
Chen Ping said calmly!
“What did you say?” The Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion was furious, his aura beginning to surge.
Everyone else was shocked. None of them expected Chen Ping to dare speak to the Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion like this.
“I said you’re not worthy. Are you deaf?”
Chen Ping said!
“Chen Ping, how dare you speak to our Pavilion Master like that?”
Elder Tong roared!
This guy, unable to move an inch, was still acting so arrogantly.
“Noisy…”
Chen Ping snorted coldly, casually waving his hand!
A golden light shot out, instantly piercing Elder Tong’s body. At the same time, Elder Tong’s head was flung high into the air, rolling far across the ground!
Boom!
In an instant, a terrifying aura locked onto Chen Ping.
The others grew nervous, retreating one after another, fearing they’d be caught in the crossfire.
Seeing Chen Ping dare to kill Tianyuan Pavilion’s Elder Tong in front of the Pavilion Master, the Third Elder of the Asura Hall couldn’t help but give a thumbs-up, “Badass…”
“Badass…”
The dozen or so black-clad members of the Asura Hall shouted in unison!
This made the Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion’s face turn utterly grim. This was a public slap to his face.
“Boom…”
The Pavilion Master’s projection suddenly expanded, his black robes billowing, stirring up a tangible storm of spiritual energy.
Within a ten-zhang radius, the stone tiles cracked inch by inch. The Mo family disciples were flung back by the shockwave, crashing into walls and spitting blood.
“Arrogant brat!”
The Pavilion Master’s projection slashed through the void with a finger, sending a ghostly blue ice spike, sharp as a viper’s tongue, screaming towards Chen Ping’s forehead.
Where the ice spike passed, the air froze into frost, and the ground split into a three-foot trench!
“Chen Ping, be careful!” Mo Qingyun cried out in alarm.
Mo Wuji also broke into a cold sweat for Chen Ping!
Though the Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion was only a projection, his strength was not to be underestimated.
Mo Qingchen, on the other hand, wore a cold smirk, mocking Chen Ping’s overconfidence in daring to offend even the Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion.
Wasn’t this just courting death?
Yet, facing the Pavilion Master’s attack, Chen Ping stood unmoved.
Just as the ice spike was three inches from his forehead…
“Clang!”
A sword’s cry echoed through the clouds!
Chen Ping flicked his fingers lightly, and a golden glow erupted from his fingertips, transforming into a three-zhang giant blade that slashed across the sky.
Where the golden blade passed, the void twisted, cleaving the Pavilion Master’s ice spike in two!
“Boom!!!”
The shockwave from the collision of the two forces swept across the area.
The dome of the Mo family’s council hall exploded, countless fragments raining down like a storm.
The crowd scattered in panic, the weaker cultivators fainting from the shock.
As the dust settled, everyone was stunned to see.
Chen Ping stood with his hands behind his back, not a single thread of his robe out of place.
The golden giant blade had shattered the Pavilion Master’s ice spike into countless specks of light!
“Is that all you’ve got?” Chen Ping sneered.
For the first time, the Pavilion Master’s projection showed a trace of shock, “You…”
Before he could finish, Chen Ping suddenly raised his hand and grabbed!
“Crack!”
The golden glow pierced through the projection’s chest like a living thing, instantly transforming into nine chains that bound its limbs.
The Pavilion Master’s projection struggled frantically, but Chen Ping’s palm erupted with supreme fire…
