Upon hearing the words of the Gadfly, Bai Yi’s heart tightened involuntarily. He couldn’t understand how the Gadfly knew there were people in the Purgatory Arena.
Could it be that Chen Ping caused some commotion in the Purgatory Arena, alarming even the city lord, who then brought people over?
Not far away, Bai Yi was trembling slightly. If the Gadfly was indeed here to capture Chen Ping, with just the two of them, they had no ability to resist.
“City Lord, the trial participants haven’t come out yet,” the staff lady said.
“Oh!” The Gadfly nodded, then led his people to rest nearby.
He was waiting for Chen Ping to appear, while Bai Yi, in a panic, quietly moved to the entrance, hoping Chen Ping would come out soon so he could take him away discreetly, avoiding the Gadfly’s notice.
As Bai Yi waited anxiously, the figures of Chen Ping and the Mad Immortal appeared.
The two emerged from the Purgatory Arena and flew straight to the entrance.
Looking at the towering staircase, if they had to walk down it, Chen Ping would probably collapse.
“Son-in-law…” Seeing Chen Ping appear, Bai Yi hurriedly approached.
“Father-in-law, why haven’t you left? You’re still waiting for me here?” Chen Ping asked, somewhat surprised.
“I was worried something might happen to you, so I couldn’t leave and kept waiting,” Bai Yi said, his gaze shifting to the Mad Immortal beside him. “And this fellow cultivator is…?”
“This is my little brother, the Mad Immortal,” Chen Ping said casually.
“The Mad Immortal?” Bai Yi was instantly shocked, sizing up the Mad Immortal in disbelief. “Could you be the same Mad Immortal who entered the Purgatory Arena hundreds of years ago and never came out?”
The Mad Immortal nodded. “Uncle, don’t call me senior. Chen Ping is my big brother, and since you’re his father-in-law, I should call you uncle.”
“No, no, no, Senior Mad Immortal, you…”
“Father-in-law, if he wants to call you that, let him. No need to refuse,” Chen Ping interrupted before Bai Yi could finish.
With the Mad Immortal’s temperament, if Bai Yi kept refusing, he might start kowtowing right there.
“Alright!” Bai Yi nodded, then said to Chen Ping, “Son-in-law, let’s leave quickly. We shouldn’t stay here too long.”
“Father-in-law, has something happened?” Chen Ping asked, puzzled.
Why was he being urged to leave right after coming out?
“Don’t ask, just follow me and leave first,” Bai Yi said, leading Chen Ping to slip away from the side, avoiding the main entrance.
But just as they were about to leave, the staff lady spotted them.
“Hey, what’s with you lot? Why are you sneaking off instead of using the main entrance?”
“Did you steal something? Come here and let me check,” the staff lady shouted at Chen Ping and the others.
Bai Yi frowned instantly. This was trouble; they couldn’t slip away quietly now.
However, seeing that the Gadfly hadn’t come over, Bai Yi quickly stepped forward. “Madam, we haven’t stolen anything. We just want to leave quickly because of some family matters.”
As he spoke, Bai Yi took out a storage pouch and handed it to the staff lady.
The staff lady’s eyes widened. “What are you doing? Trying to bribe me? Let me tell you, I’m dutiful and won’t accept your bribes.”
“All of you, come here and let me check. I bet you stole something.”
“Who are you accusing of stealing? What rubbish is there to steal in this place?” Chen Ping snapped, annoyed at the staff lady.
She was just a ticket seller, acting like some high official, blabbering nonsense!
“Shut your filthy mouth! How dare you accuse my big brother of stealing? Are you tired of living?” the Mad Immortal roared, stepping forward and pointing at the staff lady.
