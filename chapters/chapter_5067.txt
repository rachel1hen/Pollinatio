“No need for that, just treat Jingjing well, cherish her, after all, she’s just become a wife,” Huo Zhao said, looking at Huo Jingjing with affection.
“Exactly, brother-in-law, go easy on her. I saw sister limping earlier, must be swollen!” Huo Shizi chimed in.
Huo Jingjing’s face flushed, and she glared at her brother, “Huo Feng, I’ll kill you…”
With that, she swung a fist at Huo Feng, who bolted.
The two chased and ran!
Only then did Chen Ping learn his brother-in-law’s name was Huo Feng.
“These two kids, always bickering like this,” Huo Zhao said fondly.
“Father-in-law, let me take you somewhere to heal. In less than a day, your injuries should be fully recovered.”
Chen Ping said to Huo Zhao.
“Where?” Huo Zhao asked, full of curiosity.
“You’ll see when we get there!” Chen Ping smiled.
Chen Ping led Huo Zhao directly into the Demon-Suppressing Tower!
Seeing the tower and feeling its time flow, along with the piles of immortal stones, Huo Zhao was stunned.
“Dear son-in-law, what… what is this?” Huo Zhao asked in shock.
“This is the Demon-Suppressing Tower. Inside, time flows a hundred times faster than outside. A year out there is a century in here.”
Chen Ping explained.
“A century?” Huo Zhao was floored.
“So, I cultivate for a day in here, and only a day passes outside?”
Chen Ping nodded, “Exactly.”
Huo Zhao’s breathing quickened. No wonder Chen Ping said he could heal in a day.
“Where did this Demon-Suppressing Tower come from?” Huo Zhao asked curiously.
Chen Ping smiled faintly, “Father-in-law, focus on healing first, we’ll talk later!”
A complex look flashed in Huo Zhao’s eyes, then he laughed, “Good, good, looks like my daughter’s got a good eye…”
Huo Zhao was now thoroughly impressed with Chen Ping.
Chen Ping chuckled inwardly.
This old guy, clearly beaten into submission, was now making excuses for himself.
But he didn’t call him out, instead urging Huo Zhao to heal.
Inside the Demon-Suppressing Tower, Huo Zhao sat cross-legged, feeling the dense immortal energy pour into his body, his injuries healing at a visible rate.
When Chen Ping emerged from the tower, he saw Huo Jingjing still chasing Huo Feng, who was scurrying away with his head in his hands.
“Brother-in-law, save me, save me…”
Huo Feng spotted Chen Ping and hid behind him!
As Huo Jingjing chased over, Huo Feng said to Chen Ping, “Brother-in-law, put in more effort tonight, make sure my sister can’t walk, so she can’t hit me…”
“Huo Feng, you dare say that? I’ll kill you…”
Huo Jingjing’s face turned crimson with embarrassment.
Chen Ping smiled faintly, ignoring the siblings’ antics, and entered Hu Mazi’s room.
Hu Mazi was in the middle of a romp with two women and jumped when Chen Ping barged in.
“Damn, kid, don’t you know how to knock?” Hu Mazi grumbled.
“Master Hu, at this rate, you’ll die on a woman’s belly one day, won’t you?”
Chen Ping said, exasperated.
“Mind your own business. You’re no different, kid. Don’t you know how many women you’ve got?”
Hu Mazi shot Chen Ping a look.
Chen Ping was speechless, unsure himself how many women he had.
“Master Hu, I need you to look at something,” Chen Ping said.
Hu Mazi waved the women off to get dressed and leave.
“What is it?” Hu Mazi asked.
Chen Ping took out a blood-red coffin from his storage ring, covered in runes.
Chen Ping was eager to know what was inside this coffin…
