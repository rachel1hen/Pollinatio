The sword’s momentum didn’t falter, leaving a bone-deep gash across Tianci’s chest, blood gushing out!
Defeated!
The entire scene fell into dead silence!
Mo Qingyun’s beautiful eyes widened, her red lips slightly parted, staring at the scene in disbelief.
The white-robed woman and the three black-robed elders were also filled with shock, unconsciously stepping back several paces.
A third-rank Loose Immortal defeating Tianci, two ranks above him?
This completely upended their understanding!
“You dare injure the prodigy of Tian Yuan Pavilion?” Elder Tong could no longer sit still, bellowing, “Die!”
He leapt forward, his hands waving as dozens of golden array patterns emerged, weaving into a vast net in the air, enveloping Chen Ping.
Each node of the net glimmered with an ancient seal, radiating a binding force.
A massive array trapped Chen Ping within. Though Elder Tong’s cultivation wasn’t high, his mastery of array techniques was unparalleled.
It was precisely this mastery that earned him the position of an elder in Tian Yuan Pavilion, revered by others.
“A mere trapping array, and you dare show it off?”
Chen Ping sneered, his eyes flashing with golden light, instantly spotting the array’s weak point.
With a flick of his finger, a precise stream of spiritual energy struck the array’s core, and the entire net shattered like foam!
“What?”
Elder Tong’s face changed drastically, stumbling back two steps, “You… you understand arrays?”
“A bit,” Chen Ping smiled faintly.
Elder Tong’s face now looked worse than if he’d eaten a hundred pounds of filth.
Moments ago, he had mocked Chen Ping for knowing nothing about arrays, and now he was slapped in the face.
“Elder Tong, we strike together. We must kill him today.”
The injured Tianci was like a raging beast.
He had never suffered such a defeat, so even if it meant death, he would drag Chen Ping down with him.
Elder Tong nodded. They had no choice but to team up now.
In front of the Asura Hall members, if both of them lost to Chen Ping, Tian Yuan Pavilion would become a laughingstock.
The two gathered their remaining strength, preparing to deliver a fatal blow to Chen Ping.
The white-robed woman watched with keen interest, showing no intention of intervening.
She was waiting for the snipe and clam to fight, reaping the benefits after they exhausted each other. Then, she could easily take the coffins from Chen Ping.
Perhaps she could even seize all the resources on Chen Ping, Tianci, and the others.
Chen Ping saw through the white-robed woman’s scheme, but with Tianci and Elder Tong fighting desperately, he had to give his all.
Dealing with the white-robed woman afterward would likely be difficult.
As Chen Ping frowned, pondering a solution, his gaze suddenly caught the runes behind the two warrior statues. The glowing runes felt strangely familiar to him.
“I see!”
He darted forward, placing both hands on the runes behind the warrior statues. His spiritual energy flowed in a specific pattern, pouring into the runes.
The runes instantly glowed with blood-red light, writhing as if alive.
Crack—
The sound of stone peeling echoed as the two warrior statues abruptly opened their eyes, shooting out beams of blood-red light.
The stone skin on their bodies flaked off, revealing pitch-black armour etched with ancient runes, exuding a chilling aura.
“Kill!”
At Chen Ping’s command, the two warriors charged forward, swift as lightning.
One wielded a three-metre-long black greatsword, its blade wrapped in blood-red lightning; the other gripped a white longsword, its tip flickering with ghostly blue flames.
Tianci and Elder Tong fought hastily but were no match.
The black greatsword slashed down, snapping Tianci’s golden spear in two; the white longsword struck, shattering Elder Tong’s protective spiritual light like paper.
Boom, boom, boom!
Each strike from the warriors was heavy as a mountain, forcing the two into constant retreat.
Tianci’s left arm was wounded by a slash, and Elder Tong’s right leg was injured, blood staining the ground.
“Chen Ping! Today’s grudge, Tian Yuan Pavilion will repay!”
Tianci gritted his teeth, crushing a golden escape talisman. He and Elder Tong transformed into a streak of golden light and fled.
