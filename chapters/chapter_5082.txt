However, the Third Elder still did not speak, then slowly descended, and step by step walked towards Chen Ping!
Seeing this, Elder Tong immediately burst into laughter, and Tianci also slightly curled his lips, waiting to see how the people from the Asura Hall would kill Chen Ping.
But after the Third Elder walked up to Chen Ping, he unexpectedly gave a deep bow, then said very politely, “Mr. Chen, I’m truly sorry. Our young master Sang Kun offended Mr. Chen, and he deserved his fate.”
“However, he was instigated by others. I hope Mr. Chen will not hold our Asura Hall responsible. Our young lady specially sent me to apologise to Mr. Chen.”
The Third Elder’s attitude was so sincere that it took Chen Ping by surprise!
The others, seeing this, were completely stunned!
Especially Elder Tong, who looked at the Third Elder in disbelief, then loudly asked, “Third Elder, is your Asura Hall really this cowardly? Your young master was killed, and you’re apologising to the killer?”
“Silence! If it weren’t for your instigation, trying to use someone else to do your dirty work, how would our young master have died?”
As soon as the words fell, the Third Elder struck instantly.
A flash of blood-red light shot straight towards Elder Tong.
Elder Tong’s face changed drastically, his hands quickly forming seals, and a shield instantly rose in front of him.
Boom!
With a loud bang, Elder Tong was directly blasted backwards. The moment he landed, the Third Elder leapt up, and another blood-red light shot towards him.
This time, the blood-red light was even faster, piercing straight into Elder Tong’s body!
Elder Tong stood rooted to the spot, motionless.
“How dare you attack someone from our Tianyuan Pavilion?”
Seeing this, Tianci hurriedly ran over, trying to save Elder Tong, but Elder Tong stood motionless, his eyes filled with terror!
His mastery of formations was impressive, but his actual strength was no match for the Third Elder of the Asura Hall, which was why he was in such a sorry state.
“Tianci, summon the Pavilion Master…”
Elder Tong, still motionless, gritted his teeth and forced out a few words!
He knew that if no one came to his rescue now, he and Tianci were as good as dead!
Tianci nodded, grabbed the jade pendant from Elder Tong’s waist, and crushed it forcefully.
Instantly, a mysterious force enveloped Elder Tong and Tianci.
A faint figure slowly appeared before the two!
“Pavilion Master, save me…” Elder Tong, seeing this, hurriedly shouted.
The Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion had arrived, though only as a projection!
The Third Elder’s expression shifted slightly at the sight.
Killing an elder of Tianyuan Pavilion in front of their Pavilion Master was something he didn’t have the courage to do.
“Are the elders of my Tianyuan Pavilion someone your Asura Hall can slaughter at will?”
The Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion spoke in an icy tone!
“Pavilion Master Tian, are you unaware of what your people have done?” the Third Elder retorted!
The Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion slowly turned his head to look at Elder Tong, causing Elder Tong’s face to pale.
“Your people instigated our young master Sang Kun to target Mr. Chen, informing him that Mr. Chen possessed treasures from the ruins, leading to our young master’s death. Tell me, shouldn’t our Asura Hall demand an explanation from you?”
The Third Elder pressed his accusation!
The Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion, of course, knew about this—it was his idea, after all—but at this moment, he naturally couldn’t admit it.
“Your Asura Hall’s young master was killed by that Chen Ping, so go take your revenge on him. What does it have to do with our Tianyuan Pavilion?”
“Are you bullying our Tianyuan Pavilion, thinking we have no one to defend us?”
The Pavilion Master of Tianyuan Pavilion said coldly!
“I didn’t instigate anything. Your young master Sang Kun was just too foolish. He got greedy on his own. What does that have to do with me?”
“I told plenty of people about the treasures from the ruins on Chen Ping. Why didn’t anyone else die?”
With his Pavilion Master backing him, Elder Tong grew bolder.
