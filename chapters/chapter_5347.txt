Chen Ping lowered his head in deep thought, faintly feeling in his heart that this matter was inextricably linked to the demon clan.
The demon clan had always delusionally attempted to break the seal, release the demon souls, and stage a comeback.
Now, with the Thunder Sound Bell stolen, and the timing just approaching the centennial period, this was absolutely no coincidence.
“Daoist, I have an idea here.”
Chen Ping raised his head, took out the Dragon Pattern Bell from his storage ring, looked at Daoist Wuji, “I have a Dragon Pattern Bell in my hand. Although it cannot compare to the Thunder Sound Bell, it is also a treasure.
I think, perhaps we can draw runes on the Dragon Pattern Bell to imitate the effects of the Thunder Sound Bell, and first try if it can suppress the demon souls.”
A glimmer of hope flashed in Daoist Wuji’s eyes. He looked at the Dragon Pattern Bell in Chen Ping’s hand, examined it carefully for a moment, then nodded slightly. “This bell’s material is extraordinary. If we can draw runes on it, perhaps there is indeed a possibility to try.
However, drawing runes is not an easy task. It requires a master proficient in talisman arts.”
“Daoist, leave this matter to me and Master Hu!”
Chen Ping turned his head to look at Hu Mazi. Hu Mazi patted his chest and guaranteed. “That’s right, drawing runes, I’m good at it! As long as there are suitable materials, I guarantee to draw powerful runes on the Dragon Pattern Bell!”
Daoist Wuji immediately instructed his disciples to fetch the materials needed for drawing runes, all of which were mineral powders containing thunder-type spiritual power, as well as specially made spiritual brushes and talisman paper.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi found a quiet room and began to retreat to draw the runes.
The two worked day and night without stop, relying on their exquisite skills and powerful spiritual power, drawing the runes stroke by stroke on the Dragon Pattern Bell.
Each rune contained the two’s spiritual power and heart’s blood, echoing with the dragon patterns on the bell body.
Several days passed, and the Dragon Pattern Bell was now covered with densely packed runes, emanating a mysterious aura.
At that moment, Thunder Sound Mountain suddenly shook violently. Dark clouds densely covered the sky, and black demonic shadows appeared faintly in the cloud layers. Shrill howling sounds echoed through the mountains. The ten thousand demon souls seemed to have detected the loosening of the seal and began to crazily impact it.
“There’s no time left, we can only treat a dead horse as a living one, strike the Dragon Pattern Bell!”
Chen Ping shouted loudly, and together with Hu Mazi, they carried the Dragon Pattern Bell to the platform at the mountain top.
Chen Ping circulated his spiritual power, grasped the bell hammer with both hands, and fiercely smashed it towards the Dragon Pattern Bell.
“Dong——”
A tremendous sound rang out. The Dragon Pattern Bell emitted a muffled bell toll, the sound spreading throughout the entire Thunder Sound Mountain.
The instant the bell sounded, those demonic shadows seemed to be restrained by some force, their originally疯狂 impact momentum pausing for a moment.
However, the power of the demon souls was too strong. Merely a moment later, they began to crazily impact the seal again.
The runes on the Dragon Pattern Bell flashed with light, constantly resisting the impact of the demon souls, but still, some demon souls broke through the seal and pounced towards the mountain top.
Just as everyone was in despair, the dragon patterns on the Dragon Pattern Bell suddenly flashed with dazzling golden light. Immediately after, the golden light condensed, transforming into a huge azure dragon.
The azure dragon raised its head and let out a long roar, its voice shaking heaven and earth. Then, it waved its enormous claws, slapping those demon souls that had broken through the seal one by one into pieces.
The demon souls were temporarily suppressed, but everyone knew this was only a temporary measure.
Although the Dragon Pattern Bell was powerful, it was not specifically used for suppressing demon souls, and it probably could not maintain the seal for a long time.
“We must find the Thunder Sound Bell as soon as possible!”
Chen Ping’s face was solemn as he looked at Daoist Wuji. “Daoist, I think the person who stole the Thunder Sound Bell must want to release the demon souls, and it is highly likely related to the demon clan.
Master Hu and I will go down the mountain now to investigate this matter. Daoist, you lead the disciples to guard the Dragon Pattern Bell well, and make sure to stabilise the seal.”
Daoist Wuji nodded, his expression firm. “Good! Everything is entrusted to you. The entire Thunder Sound Temple, from top to bottom, will do our utmost to guard the Dragon Pattern Bell and not let the demon souls break out.”
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi bid farewell to Daoist Wuji and flew towards the foot of the mountain.
