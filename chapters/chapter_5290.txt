“Don’t go deeper…”
Just as Chen Ping and the three of them were heading deeper into the Black Wind Mountain Range, the voice of the Red Cloud Demon Lord, which had been missing in Chen Ping’s sea of consciousness, suddenly rang out!
Chen Ping abruptly stopped, then called out to the Red Cloud Demon Lord. “Senior, Senior…”
But after calling several times in a row, there was no response, as if the Red Cloud Demon Lord had disappeared again!
“Chen Ping, what’s wrong?”
Seeing Chen Ping suddenly stop, Hu Mazi asked!
Chen Ping didn’t speak, but frowned slightly, not understanding what the Red Cloud Demon Lord was up to!
“Chen Ping, what’s wrong?” Mo Chen also asked!
“Master, let’s not go looking for the Evil Path Hall first. I always feel my strength isn’t strong enough yet. I need to enhance it a bit more.”
Chen Ping said!
“I don’t mind, I’ll listen to you!” After Mo Chen finished speaking, he looked at Hu Mazi!
After all, going to the Evil Path Hall was to find the divine souls of the Hu clan for Hu Mazi!
“Chen Ping, what’s really going on? You don’t want to help me?” Hu Mazi looked at Chen Ping in disbelief and asked!
He had known Chen Ping for so long, and had never seen Chen Ping back down!
But now Chen Ping was actually backing down!
“Master Hu, of course I want to help you, but we must act cautiously. The forces that dealt with your Hu clan back then weren’t just the Evil Path Hall; there are also those like the Ten Thousand Poisons Valley and the Holy Light Sect. We can start with these forces first!”
Chen Ping decided to start with the soft targets, to get resources from these sects, and after enhancing his own strength, then go settle accounts with the Evil Path Hall!
The Red Cloud Demon Lord suddenly popping out with such a sentence could absolutely not be said casually!
So Chen Ping decided to believe the Red Cloud Demon Lord!
“Alright, then we’ll start with the other forces first!” Hu Mazi nodded!
“I know the Ten Thousand Poisons Valley; it’s only over three thousand li from here. It’s surrounded by poisonous qi year-round, and there are many poisonous creatures. I can take you there!”
Mo Chen said!
“Good!” Chen Ping nodded, and the three turned back, heading straight for the Ten Thousand Poisons Valley!
The three changed direction, speeding towards the Ten Thousand Poisons Valley.
Mo Chen was extremely familiar with this area; along the way, he constantly pointed out paths, avoiding those demonic beasts that were especially violent due to the erosion of baleful qi.
“The poisonous miasma of the Ten Thousand Poisons Valley has three layers,” Mo Chen said solemnly while flying on his sword. “The outer layer is the green miasma, which can paralyse spiritual power; the middle layer is the purple miasma, which can corrode meridians; the core area’s black miasma, upon contact, causes instant death. Even Earth Immortal Realm cultivators would perish.”
Hu Mazi crushed a clear baleful talisman; a pale golden light shield enveloped the three. He smacked his lips and said, “Lucky I brought the ancestral poison-repelling powder; otherwise, before seeing the people of the Ten Thousand Poisons Valley, we’d turn into poison corpses first.”
A faint strand of black qi lingered at Chen Ping’s fingertips; that was the baleful qi refined from the sword tomb.
He discovered that these poisonous substances drifting in the air could actually be slowly devoured by the baleful qi, though the speed was extremely slow.
“Perhaps we don’t need to rely on talismans,” Chen Ping suddenly spoke. “I’ll try using the baleful qi to clear the way.”
With that, he circulated his spiritual power; the baleful qi around his body suddenly expanded, forming a pitch-black barrier.
Those greenish miasmas, upon touching the black qi, melted like ice meeting fire, actually opening a clear path ahead of the three.
A flash of surprise passed through Mo Chen’s eyes. “Your baleful qi can actually counter the poisons?”
Chen Ping also wanted to say he was immune to all poisons, that the Heart Condensing Art could refine everything, but this only applied to Chen Ping himself. If he wanted the people around him to not be harmed by poisons, Chen Ping had to use this baleful qi to counter them.
“Perhaps because they are essentially yin and evil things,” Chen Ping pondered. “The baleful qi is superior, so it can devour the poisons.”
Hu Mazi slapped his thigh and laughed. “This saves me a lot of talismans!”
The three sped up, passing through the continuous poisonous marshes.
