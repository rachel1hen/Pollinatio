Boom!
At last, the power of the Heavenly Dao slammed into Chen Ping, and in the end, that little Heaven-Devouring Beast never showed up!
With a massive explosion, the entire mountain peak was razed to the ground, and Chen Ping’s figure vanished!
Where he’d been standing, a crater over a hundred metres deep had formed!
“Chen Ping…”
Seeing this, Lin Keting cried out anxiously, about to rush forward!
But the sisters Hong Yao and Lan Yao held her back, “Don’t go up there! With your strength, you’d turn to ash before you even got close!”
Nan Batian and Li Chunfeng stared in shock as well!
“This…”
Li Chunfeng glanced at Nan Batian.
“What’s going on?” Nan Batian looked utterly baffled.
“Didn’t you just say it wasn’t bragging? How’d it turn out like this?”
Li Chunfeng asked!
“How should I know? Something’s off here!”
Nan Batian scratched his head.
“Should we go check?” Li Chunfeng asked!
“The Heavenly Dao power hasn’t stopped yet. Can you withstand it?” Nan Batian replied!
“No way!”
“Me neither…”
“Then we wait!” Li Chunfeng abandoned the idea of going to look.
Just then, a dragon’s roar echoed through the air, and beams of golden light shot up from the hundred-metre crater!
A massive bell radiating golden light slowly floated up from the depths!
Around the golden bell, an enormous dragon coiled and spiralled!
And beneath the bell, Chen Ping’s body remained unharmed!
“What kind of treasure is this?” Nan Batian gasped in awe!
“To withstand the Heavenly Dao power of a Golden Immortal, this must be a divine artefact.”
Li Chunfeng’s eyes widened, his face full of disbelief!
Buzz!
With a humming sound from the Dragon Pattern Bell, the Heavenly Dao power vanished in an instant!
Chen Ping’s body gently descended, and the Dragon Pattern Bell disappeared as well!
“Mr. Chen, are you alright?”
“Mr. Chen, are you okay?”
Nan Batian and Li Chunfeng hurried over!
“Hmph, the mere Heavenly Dao power of a Golden Immortal? Nothing to worry about…”
Chen Ping said calmly, his tone light and steady!
But no one noticed that his legs were trembling. If he hadn’t summoned the Dragon Pattern Bell at the last second, he’d likely have been reduced to ashes by now!
“Mr. Chen, I underestimated you. To think you possess such a divine artefact! If you’d brought it out earlier, I wouldn’t stand a chance against you!”
Li Chunfeng said earnestly!
Chen Ping smiled, “Things like this? I’ve got plenty more in my storage ring. It’s hardly a divine artefact…”
Hearing Chen Ping’s words, Li Chunfeng fell silent!
At this point, he didn’t dare call it bragging anymore!
After all, the man was genuinely formidable!
“Here, take some immortal spirit stones to recover your strength. They won’t get you back to your peak, but they’ll stop your power from dropping further!”
Chen Ping casually tossed a storage pouch to Li Chunfeng!
Holding the immortal spirit stones, Li Chunfeng said awkwardly, “Mr. Chen, you’ve freed me and now you’re giving me resources. How can I ever repay you…”
“If you want to repay me, there’ll be plenty of chances. I’ve offended the people of the Divine Temple, so you’ll need to help me out in the future!” Chen Ping said!
“The Divine Temple?” Li Chunfeng paused, “You mean that temple founded by those self-righteous, bloodline-obsessed god clans?”
“Yeah, you know of them?”
Chen Ping asked!
“Of course! That lot from the Divine Temple are insufferably arrogant and look down on everyone. Back in the Heavenly Realm, hardly anyone liked them.”
Li Chunfeng replied!
“Senior, have you dealt with the Divine Temple people before?” Chen Ping asked curiously!
“I have. I once sparred with one of their temple masters in swordsmanship, and I lost…”
Li Chunfeng said!
“Which temple master?” Chen Ping’s face lit up with surprise.
To think that Li Chunfeng, at his peak, must’ve been incredibly powerful, yet he’d lost to a temple master from the Divine Temple!
It seemed the Divine Temple’s strength was truly formidable.
“The Third Temple Master…” Li Chunfeng answered!
“Oh, that’s not too bad…” Chen Ping let out a long breath of relief!
After the Third Temple Master, there were still the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth masters. For now, he shouldn’t be in immediate danger!
Surely the Divine Temple wouldn’t send the Third Temple Master after him right off the bat!
