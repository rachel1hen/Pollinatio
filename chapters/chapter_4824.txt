“I suspect the world inside this Heavenly Ladder isn’t fixed and unchanging. It’s a shame that once we pass a tier, we can’t re-enter to verify it.”
Xuan Bin said, gazing at the Heavenly Ladder before him!
“Who cares? As long as we can gain resources and training inside the Heavenly Ladder, that’s enough. Relying on it to reach the Heavenly Realm isn’t much easier than ascending through cultivation!”
Zhou Tang spoke up!
For people of their strength, the Heavenly Ladder was just a place to hone themselves and scavenge for useful resources in its worlds!
As for climbing all nine tiers to ascend to the Heavenly Realm, that was practically impossible!
“Mr. Chen, we’ll be waiting for your good news at the Dao Sect. The Heavenly Ladder will stay here for three months before it slowly disappears.”
“So, Mr. Chen, there’s no need to rush too much. Just make sure you time it right and come out within three months.”
“If the Heavenly Ladder vanishes and you haven’t emerged, you’ll be stuck in its world for a hundred years!”
Lin Chong said to Chen Ping!
“Got it!” Chen Ping nodded.
“Father, I want to go with Chen Ping into the first tier to take a look…”
Lin Keting spoke up!
“No way. Your strength is still too low. Entering the Heavenly Ladder would be dangerous, and Mr. Chen is going there to train, not to babysit you.”
Lin Chong shot Lin Keting a stern glare!
“Hmph!” Lin Keting let out a cold huff, clearly displeased!
While Chen Ping and the others talked, many had already entered the Heavenly Ladder!
Some cultivators stepped into the first tier, including Ning Zhi and Su Yuqi!
Chen Ping watched their fiery red silhouettes, surprised that these two were also entering the Heavenly Ladder for the first time!
“Young Master Chen, we sisters have to head off first. We’ve already cleared the first tier and need to go to the second.”
“I hope we can meet you on the second tier, Young Master Chen!”
Hong Yao and Lan Yao said before leaping up to the second tier’s stone step and slowly walking into the light gate!
“I’m heading out too!” Chen Ping bid farewell to the group!
But at that moment, Lin Keting suddenly leapt forward, charging straight toward the first tier’s light gate!
“Disciple…”
Wuji Daoist cried out in alarm, but it was too late. Lin Keting had already rushed into the light gate!
“Don’t worry, I’ll keep an eye on her!”
Chen Ping said, then instantly dashed after her, plunging into the light gate as well!
But as Chen Ping passed through, all he saw was a blinding white light. In the blink of an eye, he arrived in the Heavenly Ladder’s world!
When the light finally faded and his vision cleared, Chen Ping was dumbfounded!
Lin Keting was nowhere near him. He couldn’t even sense her presence within a hundred miles, or even farther!
It seemed the light gate’s teleportation was random, not sending everyone to the same spot in this world!
“I wonder how big this world is and if I can find her?”
Chen Ping frowned slightly, then surveyed the world before him!
It was a vast wasteland, stretching endlessly, with spiritual energy so thin it felt barren!
No wonder this was the first tier’s world. It’d be hard for any strong cultivators to emerge here!
But as for who he needed to defeat to clear it, Chen Ping would have to figure that out himself!
And he also had to find Lin Keting…
Chen Ping descended from midair to the ground, stepping on the gravel as he walked forward slowly!
Flying would consume too much spiritual energy, and with this world’s sparse spiritual energy and lack of resources, replenishing it would mean dipping into his own reserves. So Chen Ping opted to conserve, since resources here were precious!
He walked for who knows how long until a town appeared ahead, surrounded by a formation barrier protecting its safety!
