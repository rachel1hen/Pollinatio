The next morning,
Chen Ping stepped out of the room with his father-in-law.
At that moment, there was no sound coming from Hu Mazi’s room, and Hu Mazi himself emerged sporting two large dark circles under his eyes.
Xiu Rui also came out of his room, and both he and Hu Mazi froze when they saw an old man emerge from Chen Ping’s room.
“Bloody hell, Chen Ping, you’re not into weird stuff like this, are you?” Hu Mazi said, eyeing the old man.
“Master Hu, what nonsense are you spouting? This is my father-in-law, a former cultivator from the Celestial Realm,” Chen Ping said, introducing the old man to Xiu Rui and Hu Mazi. Then, turning to the old man, he added, “Father-in-law, these are my friends, Xiu Rui and Hu Mazi…”
“Greetings, I am Bai Yi, the Fox Emperor,” the old man said calmly.
After the introductions and greetings, Chen Ping turned to Bai Yi, “Father-in-law, could you take us to the black market?”
“Of course…”
Bai Yi nodded.
“Black market? What kind of black market? One that sells women?” Hu Mazi’s interest was instantly piqued.
“Master Hu, two women are enough for you, any more and you’ll exhaust yourself!” Chen Ping said, exasperated.
The four left the inn, led by Bai Yi, heading toward the black market.
“Chen Ping, when did you start messing around with human-beast stuff in the Celestial Realm? You even got yourself a beast clan father-in-law,” Hu Mazi whispered to Chen Ping.
“If you’re going to talk, talk properly, or don’t talk at all. What’s this human-beast nonsense?”
“Though they’re beast clan, they’ve long transformed into human form, they’re essentially human now.”
“The whole of Rhino City is beast clan, so are you saying you don’t want to fool around with the women here?” Chen Ping retorted.
“Want to? Of course I do, even if the women here haven’t transformed into human form, I’d still give it a go…” Hu Mazi grinned.
Chen Ping rolled his eyes and stopped engaging with Hu Mazi.
This guy would say anything sometimes.
Bai Yi led them through the city for over an hour, finally stopping at a dilapidated courtyard.
Outside the courtyard, war soldiers occasionally patrolled by.
The courtyard itself was in ruins, looking as though it hadn’t been inhabited in ages.
Bai Yi glanced around, ensuring no one was watching, then led Chen Ping and the others into the rundown yard.
Once inside, Bai Yi extended his right hand and gently pressed it into the air.
A flash of white light followed, and the group’s vision went dark. In an instant, they found themselves in a massive tunnel.
Fortunately, Bai Yi was leading the way, or the sudden change would have surely startled Chen Ping and the others.
After passing through the tunnel, the scene opened up before them. In this area, numerous people bustled about, and there were guards dressed in black leather, armed with weapons.
Everything was for sale here, the place was buzzing with activity, lively and chaotic.
Not far off, on a tall arena, two figures were fiercely locked in combat.
Around the arena, a crowd with bloodshot eyes roared loudly, these were the gamblers who had placed their bets.
At the top of this vast area, several houses floated in mid-air, moving back and forth, with visible silhouettes inside.
Chen Ping and the others were filled with curiosity and followed Bai Yi as he continued forward.
But when they reached the leather-clad guards, the guards suddenly stood at attention, bowing respectfully to Bai Yi and shouting, “Market Master…”
Bai Yi gave a slight nod, leaving Chen Ping and the others dumbfounded.
The people in the black market, upon seeing Bai Yi, also called out, “Master Bai…”
Chen Ping, puzzled, sidled up to Bai Yi and whispered, “Father-in-law, are these people very familiar with you?”
