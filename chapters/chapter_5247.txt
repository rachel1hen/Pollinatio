This sword strike was unremarkable, yet it carried a unique charm, as if flowing like clouds and water, naturally seamless, precisely a move from the *Flowing Cloud Sword Technique* that he had learned from the Sword Sect ruins.
The old man’s previously cloudy eyes instantly brightened, fixed intently on Chen Ping’s movements, his face revealing astonishment.
“Well done! What a fine *Flowing Cloud Sword Technique*!”
The old man couldn’t help but praise, “Though you’ve only grasped the basics, you’ve captured its charm perfectly, far surpassing this lass, Ling Xue.”
Ling Xue pouted slightly, somewhat unconvinced, but she didn’t argue, clearly acknowledging her master’s judgment.
The old man set down his hoe and walked up to Chen Ping, scrutinizing him closely, “Young man, where did you learn this swordsmanship? Tell me the truth.”
Knowing he couldn’t hide it, Chen Ping answered honestly, “I learned it from some ruins in the Third Heaven. I didn’t know it was the Sword Sect.”
The old man’s face darkened with sorrow, “Alas, that was indeed our Sword Sect’s mountain gate. Back in the day, our Sword Sect was among the top sects in the Third Heaven. Who would’ve thought it would fall to such a state?”
He sighed, then said to Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, “Let’s talk inside.”
They entered the house, where the furnishings were simple, just a table and a few chairs.
The old man poured them tea and said, “My name is Mo Chen, once the sect leader of the Sword Sect.
When disaster struck our sect, I led some disciples to escape from the Third Heaven, preserving a thread of our legacy.”
Both Chen Ping and Hu Mazi were surprised, not expecting this seemingly ordinary old man to be the former Sword Sect leader.
“Senior Mo Chen, do you know about the Evil Path Hall?” Chen Ping asked directly.
Mo Chen’s expression shifted slightly, “The Evil Path Hall? Why are you asking about them?”
“I have a grudge against them and want revenge.”
Chen Ping’s voice was grave, “They were involved in wiping out my friend’s Hu clan years ago and took their souls.”
Hu Mazi added excitedly, “Senior Mo Chen, you have to help us! We must rescue our clan’s souls and avenge them!”
Mo Chen was silent for a moment before saying, “The Evil Path Hall holds great power in the Fifth Heaven. They’re ruthless, collecting souls to cultivate evil techniques, and most factions avoid provoking them.
Taking revenge on them won’t be easy.”
“No matter how hard it is, we have to try!”
Chen Ping’s eyes were resolute, “If I can find their branch hall, I’ll risk my life to save the Hu clan’s souls.”
Mo Chen nodded, seeing Chen Ping’s determination, “Good lad, you’ve got spirit! But the Evil Path Hall’s branch halls are well-hidden and heavily guarded. The two of you alone stand no chance of getting in.”
“Do you know where their branch hall is?” Chen Ping asked.
Mo Chen shook his head, “I don’t know its exact location. The Evil Path Hall operates in secrecy, and their branch halls are known only to a few high-ranking members.”
Chen Ping felt a pang of disappointment but didn’t give up, “Do you know anyone who might know the location of their branch hall?”
After some thought, Mo Chen said, “There’s a place in Sword Saint City called the ‘Information Tower.’ They sell all kinds of information. If you can afford their price, you might get details about the Evil Path Hall’s branch hall.
But the power behind the Information Tower is mysterious, and the accuracy of their information can be hard to verify. Be cautious.”
“Thank you, Senior,” Chen Ping said, standing up. “We’ll head to the Information Tower now.”
“Wait.”
Mo Chen stopped him, “Young man, you have great talent in swordsmanship. Why not join our Sword Sect? We may be small now, but we can offer cultivation resources.
With us, at least in Sword Saint City, no one would dare bully you easily.”
