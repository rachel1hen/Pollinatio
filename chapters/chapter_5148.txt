Hu Mazi’s eyes lit up instantly, sizing up the Saintess as if he could see right through her. His gaze gleamed with lust, practically drooling!
“I’ve long heard the Saintess of the Blood Shadow Palace is exceptional in bed. I’d love to test my skills, known as the Ten-Times-a-Night Man. I wonder if I could win the Saintess’s favour?”
Hu Mazi teased her shamelessly.
The Saintess snorted coldly, “Shameless.”
She raised her jade hand, and a streak of blood-red light shot toward Hu Mazi’s face.
Hu Mazi didn’t dodge. With a flick of his fan, a loud “bang” rang out, and the blood-red light dissipated.
“Why so angry, Saintess?”
Hu plafond smiled, “I’m merely an admirer of your grace, here to pay my respects.”
A flicker of surprise crossed the Saintess’s eyes.
Though she hadn’t used her full strength, an ordinary eighth-rank Loose Immortal would struggle to block that strike.
Yet this unremarkable old man had deflected it so easily?
“Who exactly are you?” The Saintess grew wary.
Before Hu Mazi could answer, Chen Ping’s voice cut through, “Saintess, the Tianyan Sect is already destroyed. The Blood Shadow Palace is next. If you’re wise, hand over all your resources and order your disciples to strip naked for Master Hu to enjoy. Do that, and I might consider sparing your corpses.”
The Saintess’s pupils contracted, “What are you?”
To her, Chen Ping was just a fifth-rank Loose Immortal, yet he dared speak such arrogant words.
Though the Blood Shadow Palace’s female cultivators had all slept with men and practised yin-yang absorption techniques, stripping naked to be humiliated by an old man was utterly unacceptable.
Chen Ping’s eyes blazed with golden light, “What am I? For that word alone, the Blood Shadow Palace will fall today!”
The Saintess burst into delicate laughter, but it was laced with killing intent, “You think you lot can destroy my Blood Shadow Palace? What a delusion.”
Her hands formed seals, and the entire Blood Shadow Palace trembled. Blood seeped from the ground, condensing in the air into countless blood arrows.
“Blood Shadow Array, activate!”
The blood arrows rained down like a storm toward Chen Ping and his group.
Chen Ping was about to act, but Hu Mazi shouted, “I said this is my show!”
He swiftly tossed out talismans, and a golden light curtain sprang up, blocking all the blood arrows.
The arrows struck the curtain, hissing with corrosive sounds, but couldn’t break through.
“Huh?”
The Saintess looked stunned, “You can block my Blood Shadow Arrows?”
Hu Mazi grinned, “Saintess, how about a bet?”
“What bet?”
“If I win, you spend a night with me. If I lose, you can do whatever you want with me.” Hu Mazi winked.
The Saintess laughed in fury, “Courting death!”
She flashed forward, transforming into a blood-red shadow lunging at Hu Mazi.
Her ten fingernails suddenly extended, like ten blood-red blades aimed at his throat.
Hu Mazi remained calm, tossing out a talisman that formed a complete Taiji diagram in front of him.
The Saintess’s claws struck the diagram, sinking as if into a quagmire, their force largely dissipated.
“Taiji Force Dispersion?”
The Saintess sneered, “Let’s see how much you can disperse!”
Her figure blurred again, splitting into eight blood-red shadows, attacking Hu Mazi from different angles.
Each shadow was lifelike, impossible to distinguish.
From a distance, Yun Wuya frowned, “The Saintess’s Blood Shadow Clones have reached perfection. Master Hu might…”
But Chen Ping smiled faintly, “Don’t underestimate that old lecher. He’s got plenty up his sleeve.”
Sure enough, facing the eight blood shadows, Hu Mazi’s playful expression vanished, his aura shifting dramatically.
He formed hand seals, chanting under his breath, “Heaven and Earth lend their power, Five Elements cycle!”
In an instant, five-coloured light radiated around him, gold, wood, water, fire, and earth cycling endlessly, forming a perfect shield.
The blood shadows struck the shield and shattered, leaving only the Saintess’s true form, knocked back several steps by the recoil.
