Chen Ping nodded, “It’s becoming more likely. We need to uncover the truth quickly, or not only us, but the entire Fourth Heaven could fall into crisis.”
The two didn’t dare linger and pressed deeper into Luoxian Valley. They knew the path ahead would be tougher, but for the Hu Clan’s grievances and the hidden truths, they had to keep going.
In the valley’s depths, the mist grew thicker, heavily restricting even their divine senses.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi moved cautiously, constantly alert to their surroundings.
Suddenly, footsteps echoed through the fog ahead.
Chen Ping signalled Hu Mazi to stop, and they held their breath, hiding behind an ancient tree.
A group of cultivators approached, led by a burly man radiating the aura of a fourth-rank Earth Immortal.
The cultivators behind him were all formidable, clearly from a powerful faction.
“Boss, we’ve been searching for so long and haven’t seen a soul. Could the intel be wrong?” a lanky cultivator asked.
The burly man snorted, “Impossible! The Black Fiend Demon Palace and the Crimson Sect both confirmed that Chen Ping is in Luoxian Valley. If we catch him, we’ll gain the favour of that great figure in the Fifth Heaven. Then, all of Jiupan Mountain will be ours!”
The other cultivators grew excited, searching with renewed vigor.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi, hidden behind the tree, didn’t dare breathe.
They hadn’t expected so many factions to be after them, and their goals weren’t just the bounty but also the Fifth Heaven’s favour.
“What do we do?” Hu Mazi whispered nervously.
Chen Ping’s brows furrowed. He knew their current strength couldn’t handle so many powerful foes at once.
Just then, the burly man seemed to sense something, striding toward their hiding spot, “Who’s there? Show yourself!”
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi’s hearts tightened, knowing they’d been exposed.
Chen Ping’s eyes hardened, ready to fight to the death, when suddenly the ground trembled violently.
A massive mountain in the distance collapsed with a roar, and a terrifying aura surged from the earth.
The entire Luoxian Valley quaked as ancient restrictions activated, sending dazzling beams of light into the sky.
“Damn it! We’ve triggered the valley’s core restrictions!” the burly man’s face paled. “Retreat, now!”
The group of cultivators fled in panic, but several were swallowed by sudden spatial rifts.
The forces of Youyue Witch and the Crimson Fairy were also caught in the chaos, with many meeting their demise.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi were stunned by the sudden turn of events.
They hadn’t expected the valley’s restrictions to be so terrifying.
“Run!” Chen Ping snapped back to reality, pulling Hu Mazi deeper into the valley.
This was their only chance.
They pressed forward through the chaos, dodging collapsing ruins and emerging spatial rifts.
Several times, they narrowly escaped being pulled into the rifts, saved only by Chen Ping’s quick reactions.
After what felt like an eternity, the tremors finally subsided.
Chen Ping and Hu Mazi collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath.
“We… we survived?” Hu Mazi said, barely believing it.
Chen Ping nodded, scanning their surroundings. They had reached an unfamiliar area.
There was no mist or ancient ruins, only a massive altar surrounded by intricate, mysterious runes.
“What… what is this place?” Hu Mazi asked, eyeing the altar curiously.
Chen Ping approached the altar, studying the runes closely.
Suddenly, his attention was drawn to a stone tablet at the altar’s centre. Carved upon it was, unbelievably, the method to reach the Fifth Heaven!
